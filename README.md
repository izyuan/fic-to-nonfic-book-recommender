This is a project to webscrape for goodreads books! it gives title, author, average rating, number of ratings, publish date, reviews, synopsis, and genre! 

Originally was going to train a recommendation model. My goal was to use word2vec for all the categories except synopsis and reviews. However, I realized that my computer physically cannot train a model (tried using gensim) so that sucked.

I might use something with chatgpt for the recommender.

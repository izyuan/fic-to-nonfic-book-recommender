The Diary of a Young Girl (Mass Market Paperback),Anne Frank,4.19,3705829,1947,"Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover","Why do we write reviews?You have a lot of reasons I guess.But for this review there is only one. I am writing this for my conscience. Ever since I have rated this book, I always end up asking myself that, have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy (some call it pity vote)?Reading other reviews (although most people just rate it and proceed) posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diary.So I’m going to start with-DO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diary?Yes it is a diary not a book. And aren’t diary meant to be something personal? Yes they are, but it was Anne's wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing names.When I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesn’t! I had the least of the expectation, knowing that she was 13 years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life. She thought and wrote over few such things that didn’t occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life. She at times made me laugh, at times made me feel sad. If she felt something, her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large margin.I have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age. Of course they were, difficult conditions make you mature and responsible, but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition, the suffering had even effect on them. I remember the letter exchange between two sisters, at that point after reading Margot’s letter, for the first time I realised Anne was still child among them.Some say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her fault.The thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events. She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of them.....I have it in my mind but can’t put it in words and why should I! Does it matter what kind of girl was she? 'NO’ from me. Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresome.I liked it, it couldn’t get any better. I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window; they were not solving murder mystery. I remember that when I was halfway through the book, I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained. I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting; I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again, feel the fresh wind and to go to school, but... This is not a book to enjoy much; we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust. Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world. No one has ever benefitted from war; all it gives is pain and misery.All this being said there is nothing to review the book, but accept it as written account of the vices of the war.The worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was: Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old? Would it have been famous as it is now?Well she didn’t survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back.!121!I confess to feeling slightly voyeuristic while reading this. It was constantly in the back of my mind that this was no ordinary novel, or even a true-to-life account. This was someone’s diary. Every page written in confidence, each word revealing the thoughts closest to the heart of this young girl. As a journal-keeper myself, I sometimes find myself wondering, “What if someone else were to read this?” which causes me to wonder how much to filter my words. But then, isn’t the purpose of a diary or journal just the opposite? To record one’s honest and unfiltered thoughts? While reading Anne Frank – The Diary of a Young Girl I do not get the sense that there is any such ‘filtering’ going on. From the ages of 12-15 Anne lived an extraordinary life, and quickly grew far beyond her years in her understanding and handling of a horrendous situation.There are surprises in this book. No matter how broad or limited your understanding of the world events that threw Anne and her family into a life in hiding, I had – before reading this – held the general assumption that, “Well, it was wartime. They were in hiding for their lives. They must have been miserable all the time. Who could possibly find anything good or redeeming in the confines of such a life?” In hindsight, of course, I have had to reconsider. I found bits of beauty, kindness, and even humour popping up in the most unexpected places. And why shouldn’t I? Aren’t our lives much the same? Oh – we’re not dodging bombs and trying to sleep to the sound of gunfire (at least not in Canada). But we, each of us, are often faced with some sort of tragedy or travesty. Sometimes we may have an entire ‘bad year’, or longer. And yet, doesn’t the buoyancy of the human spirit always shine through? It is really tough work to be miserable 24 hours a day. No matter how difficult or challenged our day-to-day life, we all have those little pockets of joy that arise, and sometimes it is those tiny occurrences that make the rest of it bearable.On a personal level, I found myself comparing Anne’s childhood to that of my parents. After all, she was only a year younger than my Mom and Dad. I think back to stories they’ve told from their teen years, and it boggles the mind to think that at the exact moment my Dad and his brothers were tipping a cow, Anne was in hiding on the other side of the world. At a time when my mother was discovering make-up, Anne was realizing that life would never again be so youthful, so joyous and carefree as before the war. A generation was losing its innocence, but in very different ways.I would recommend Anne Frank – The Diary of a Young Girl to absolutely everyone, for I believe that it holds some truth or enlightenment for everyone. I do not own this copy – it was borrowed from my daughter’s school library. She will be reading it next. She is 10. And you can bet that before long I will purchase my own copy, for I will be reading it again someday soon.!121!If only Anne Frank's diary was the figment of someone's imagination. If it meant that this spirited, intelligent and articulate girl hadn't died along with so many others in Belsen concentration camp, and that the holocaust had never happened, that would be a wonderful thing, but it did happen, and that makes the reading of this diary even more heartbreaking.For a 13 year old girl, Anne was so articulate - the way she expresses her thoughts and feelings about herself and others is remarkable. She's able to analyse herself in a particularly honest way, her abilities, failures, weaknesses.As Jews in Nazi occupied Holland, Anne and her parents and sister Margot, had to flee their home in Amsterdam to escape capture. From 1942 - 1944 they occupy rooms in an old office building, which they call 'The Secret Annexe'. Anne's diary details daily life within the confines of their safe house. They share the rooms with another couple and their teenage son and also with a former dentist. As can be expected, there were many disagreements, living in such close proximity to others, and even within their own families. Just a few of the office staff knew about The Secret Annexe, and these are the people who kept them supplied with food, but given the fact that everything was rationed due to the war, things became a bit fraught at times. The alternative however, didn't bear thinking about.In August 1944, Anne's diary suddenly becomes silent. No more words will be written in its pages. Someone had betrayed them to the Nazis and they were arrested and transported to various concentration camps. The diary was left behind and was found by the office cleaner. After being interned in two concentration camps, Anne and her sister Margot were finally sent to Bergen-Belsen where they both died - Anne was just 15 years old. Only Otto Frank (the girls' father) survived, and the diary was returned to him.This is one of those books where a silence descends on finishing it. How do you write a review? How do you do it justice? I honestly don't know. All I can think is, what a great contribution Anne would have made to an ugly world if she'd lived, her ambition was to be a writer, and yet, even in death, she HAS made a contribution by allowing us to share those two years in hiding with her, and giving us a chance to see what a beautiful soul she was. Feel so sad right now.!121!My intention of writing a review for this book is to tell all the negative reviewers to SHUT UP! I am all for everyone's right to express their opinion but I read a few of the '1 star' reviews and I was shocked to read what a few people had to say about this book. Before making an opinion I suggest people to keep a few things in mind:1. This is someone's DIARY not a book meant to entertain people. If you think it was boring then answer me, how many interesting things can you possibly do locked up in a place for 3 years??2. For those who comment on the writing-This is a 14year old's diary!! She didn't write it with the intention of winning the pulitzer.3.For those who commented on her ideologies or how nazism is portrayed. Hello!! She was 14!!! And maybe..just maybe its justified to think the way she does considering she LIVED it unlike so many of us who get to sit back on our comfortable sofas and critically analyze every XYZ thing in the world.I believe no one has the right to 'review' much less criticize a written document of a 14 year old's life who made it through the worst of circumstances and through difficulties we cannot even imagine to live through.Its a pity some people think the way they do.EDIT 27th Sep, 2013:I never imagined I would garner so many likes for this review. This only means that a lot of people are emotional about this book and take negative reviews as a personal insult. I wrote this review in a very emotionally charged mind frame. A year later, now that I am older, wiser and more mature, I realise I could have used fewer exclamation marks. :PEDIT 24th Sep, 2020: It's been 8 years since I wrote this! I am definitely, older, wiser and more mature. And so, I would like to point out, that I do regret the explosive ""SHUT UP"" in my review, no scratch that, in my ""rant"". I guess such is life when you are young- angry & angsty. It's amazing though that despite the angry tonality, there is so much love pouring in the comments section! Thanks y'all. I shall continue my attempt to grow wiser as I grow older. PS: Time for a re-read?!121!Possibly the best personal diary ever.  Nazi occupation of Netherlands, 1942. Hidden in the secret upper annex of an office building with several other jewish people, Annelies Marie Frank was thirteen years old when she started writing Kitty, her personal diary. In it, she poured all her thoughts about life, love, and the daily life with her family and other refugees. The diary coming abruptly to an end in 1944, when everyone was discovered and sent to concentration camps, where she died of typhoid fever in 1945 at the tender age of fifteen.I don't think this is a literary masterpiece by itselft, but it can very rightfully be considered one of the most historically relevant of its time. Through the simple and loving words of Anne Frank we get to know how she and her sister Margot, her parents Otto and Edith, Mr. Pfeffer and neighbors Hermann, Petronella and Peter Van Daan survived years of hunger, hardships and strained relationships hidden in precariously small living quarters with the constant threat of discovery and subsequent arrest or death. Vivid, thoughtful, tearing and touching words of a promising young lady that had much to say and live for and whose life was tragically cut short. Anne can come off as a bit childish, and even bratty sometimes. But considering the circumstances, who wouldn’t feel a bit emotionally edgy after a few years of forceful confinement? (I’m looking at you Lockdown!). I remember Miep Gies very fondly, and my heart also goes strongly for Margot, who didn’t get to be as lucky as Anne, circumstances considering.By all accounts, one of those visits one must make at least once in a lifetime. A powerful message on the resilience of the unbreakable human spirit, despite a world of cruelties and horrors happening all around it. Extremely Recommendable.*** The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) is a fantastic adaptation. The plot more than reasonably faithful to the book. Aesthetic, acting and pacing very good. A little bit too long on the length for my taste, but the extra time is more than worth it. Millie Perkins playing possibly the most memorable version of Anne. Shelley Winters also gaining some very well deserved praise. And the ending! Gosh! That. Effing. Ending. Better have a pair of tissues ready. Highly Recommendable.*** Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001) is a great adaptation, with adequate pacing and decent acting. A very memorable performance by Ben Kingsley as Otto Frank and Lili Taylor as Miep Gies. This two-episode miniseries goes beyond the scope of the original book and adds some very powerful and heart wrenching scenes of the days of Anne and Margot at the concentration camp. Maybe not the most accurate or faithful to the book, but very interesting nonetheless, and terribly heartbreaking. *** The Diary of Anne Frank (2009). I know I watched this adaptation but for some reason I don’t remember anything specific about it. I rated it 7/10 on my IMDB account so I’m assuming it must be good. Not very memorable though, apparently. I guess after watching more than three thousand movies sometimes memory gaps start to appear and this is clearly one of them. I’m not looking forward to rewatch it, pick at own risk.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [1947] [283p] [Non Fiction] [Historical] [Extremely Recommendable] [""In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.""]----------------------------------------------- Posiblemente el mejor diario personal jamás.  Ocupación nazi de Países Bajos, 1942. Escondida en el secreto anexo superior de un edificio de oficinas con varias otras personas judías, Annelies Marie Frank tenía trece años cuando empezó a escribir Gatito, su diario personal. En él, volcó todos sus pensamientos sobre la vida, el amor, y su vida diaria con su familia y otros refugiados. El diario llegando a un abrupto final en 1944, cuando todos fueron descubiertos y enviados a campos de concentración, donde murió en 1945 por fiebre tifoidea a la tierna edad de quince.No creo que esta sea una obra literaria maestra en sí misma, pero puede ser muy justamente considerada como una de las más históricamente relevantes de su tiempo. A través de las simples y amorosas palabras de Anne Frank llegamos a conocer cómo ella y su hermana Margot, sus padres Otto y Edith, Sr. Pfeffer y vecinos Hermann, Petronella y Peter Van Daan sobrevivieron años de hambruna, dificultades y relaciones tensas escondidos en precariamente pequeños cuartos de vivienda con el constante peligro de ser descubiertos y el subsiguiente arresto o muerte. Vívido, profundo, desgarradoras y conmovedoras palabras de una prometedora jovencita que tenía mucho por decir y vivir y cuya vida fue trágicamente terminada antes de tiempo.Anne puede parecer un poco infantil, ¡y a veces incluso malcriada. Pero considerando las circunstancias, ¿quién no se sentiría emocionalmente tenso después de años de confinamiento forzado? (¡Te estoy viendo a vos Cuarentena!). Recuerdo a Miep Gies muy afectuosamente, y mi corazón va fuertemente hacia Margot, que no pudo ser tan afortunada como Anne, considerando las circunstancias.A todas cuentas, uno de esas visitas que uno debe hacer al menos una vez en la vida. Un poderoso mensaje sobre la resiliencia del inquebrantable espíritu humano, a pesar de un mundo de crueldades y horrores sucediendo alrededor. Extremadamente Recomendable.*** El Diario de Anne Frank (1959) es una fantástica adaptación. La trama más que razonablemente fiel al libro. Estética, actuación y ritmo muy buenos. Un poco demasiado extensa en su duración para mi gusto, pero el tiempo extra más que lo vale. Millie Perkins haciendo tal vez la más memorable versión de Anne. Shelley Winters también ganadora de muy merecida alabanza. ¡Y ese final! ¡Dios! Ese. Maldito. Final. Mejor tener un par de pañuelos a mano. Altamente Recomendable.*** Anne Frank: Toda la Historia (2001) es una gran adaptación, con adecuado ritmo y decente elenco. Una muy memorable actuación de Ben Kingsley como Otto Frank y Lili Taylor como Miep Gies. Esta miniserie de dos episodios va más allá del alcance del libro original y añade algunas poderosas y conmovedoras escenas de los días de Anne y Margot en el campo de concentración. Tal vez no la más precisa o fiel al libro, pero sin embargo muy interesante, y terriblemente desgarradora.*** El Diario de Anne Frank (2009). Sé que vi esta adaptación pero por alguna razón no recuerdo nada específico de ella. La califiqué 7/10 en mi cuenta de IMDB así que asumo que debe ser buena. Aunque no muy memorable, aparentemente. Supongo que después de ver más de tres mil películas a veces aparecen lagunas de memoria y esta claramente es una de esas. No estoy interesado en volver a verla. Elegir a riesgo propio.-----------------------------------------------
NOTA PERSONAL
: [1947] [283p] [No Ficción] [Histórica] [Extremadamente Recomendable] [""A pesar de todo, todavía creo que la gente es realmente buena en el corazón.""] -----------------------------------------------!121!""Riches, prestige, everything can be lost. But the happiness in your own heart can only be dimmed; it will always be there, as long as you live, to make you happy again.""

I'm not sure if I can review this book properly. I started a few times before, but, it is just too difficult...I really wish I had skipped the Afterward section and read it sometime after. I don't recall being this sad after reading a book...
""Memories mean more to me than dresses.""""I once asked Margot if she thought I was ugly. She said that I was cute and had nice eyes. A little vague, don't you thing?""
From the very start, I found the style of writing to be very captivating, which could be hugely attributed to the fact that everything is completely genuine. As this was never intended to be shared with others, Anne does not hold back when it comes to confiding all her feelings, experiences and expectations in her ever trustworthy journal - Kitty. 
""I've been taking valerian every day to fight the anxiety and depression, but it doesn't stop me from being even more miserable the next day. A good hearty laugh would help better than ten valerian drops, but we've almost forgotten how to laugh.""""Despite all my theories and efforts, I miss - every day and every hour of the day - having a mother who understands me.""
In my opinion, one of the key ways this book can help all readers is by enhancing everyone's ability to empathize, not just with a teenager. Anne's experiences shine a special light on how much children suffer, due to them not being able to freely communicate or confide in others. One might say that it's just how it is with teenagers, and they'll grow out of it, but Anne's own statements contradict that - at least to an extent. When she revisits some of her earlier entries, though she regrets the fact that she feels much anger toward her mother, she never recovers completely, or finds it possible to completely forgive her. She still holds some contempt for not been able to make herself herd by her mother.
""I do my best to please everyone, more than they'd ever suspect in a million years.""""I soothe my conscience with the thought that it's better for unkind words to be down on paper than for Mother to have to carry them around in her heart.""""I continued to sit with the open book in my hand and wonder why I was filled with so much anger and hate that I had to confide it all to you.""
It's heartbreaking to see how she suffered, when she dreamt of her friends and grandmother, and the way she kept it all together in the midst of all other difficulties. Even an adult would have had a hard time under similar circumstances. But for a child... and thousands of others who went through similar devastations...
""I was very sad again last night. Grandma and Hanneli came to me once more. Grandma, oh my sweet Grandma. How lonely Grandma must have been, in spite of us. You can be lonely even when you're loved by many people,""""And Hanneli? Is she still alive? What's she doing? Dear God, watch over her and bring her back to us. Hanneli, you're a reminder of what my fate might have been. I keep seeing myself in your place.""
If I didn't say something of some of the happy memories, it will be unfair to the book. Because, even when you take away the fact that everything in this book is genuine, the style of writing - especially for an 13 year old girl - is beyond amazing. The first half of the books is going to keep you laughing, for Anne relates the day-to-day events in such an amusing way. Most readers will find the series of events to be an emotional rollercoaster. It's amazing how well she manages to record everything, relating them to people, time of day, her own feelings and many more. 
""Upstairs it sounds like thunder, but it's only Mrs. van D's bed being shoved against the window so that Her Majesty, arrayed in her pink bed jacket, can sniff the air through her delicate little nostrils.""""A few nights ago I was the topic of discussion, and we all decided I was an ignoramus.""""Dearest Kitty, Pim is expecting the invasion any day now. Churchill has had pneumonia, but is gradually getting better. Gandhi, the champion of Indian freedom, is on one of his umpteenth hunger strikes.""""Gandhi is eating again.""

""You've known for a long time that my greatest wish is to be a journalist, and later on, a famous writer.""
Yes, she would've been an amazing writer. In fact, she already has become one. How cruel it is that the hopes and dreams of millions get destroyed because of the thoughtless actions of a few.

""We still love life, we haven't yet forgotten the voice of nature, and we keep hoping, hoping for...everything.""

All I can hope is that she kept the hope kindled till the end and never gave up.!121!Honestly, I just can't do it. I can't bring myself to finish the book. Ive tried three times already, and each time I have been forced to put it aside. Books and film about the Holocaust are fascinating, but not this one. Unfortunately, I was not engaged and found I couldn't care less. I'll have to try it again in a few years. On the up side, I firmly believe that Anne Frank, had she survived the war, would have grown up to be a marvelous, best selling writer. At the age of 13 her words are better than that of many modern day, famous authors.!121!Het Achterhuis: Dagboekbrieven 12 juni 1942 - 1 augustus 1944 = The Diary of a Young Girl, Anne Frank The Diary of a Young Girl, also known as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor, just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوازدهم ماه اکتبر سال 2001میلادیعنوان: خ‍اطرات‌ ی‍ک‌ دخ‍ت‍ر ج‍وان‌؛ ن‍ویسنده‌ آن‌ ف‍ران‍ک‌؛ مت‍رج‍م ش‍ی‍وا روی‍گ‍ری‍ان‌؛ تهران، میلادی، 1370؛ چاپ دوم 1372؛ در 318ص؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان آلمان - سده 20معنوان: آن فرانک - خاطرات یک دختر جوان؛ نویسنده: آن فرانک؛ مترجم: رویا طلوع؛ در 327ص؛ ای.بوکخاطرات یک دختر جوان؛ نویسنده: آنه فرانک؛ ترجمه از هلندی بی.ام‬ مویارت - دابل‌دی؛ مقدمه از النر روزولت؛ مترجم سمانه پرهیزکاری؛ تهران، انتشارات میلکان، 1396؛ در 340ص؛ شابک 9786008812548؛عنوان: خاطرات یک دختر جوان؛ نویسنده: آنه فرانک؛ مترجم ناصر عظیمی؛ با مقدمه النور روزولت‏‫؛ ویرایش احمد علی‌پور؛ تهران، تمدن علمی، سال1399؛ ‬در 336ص؛ شابک 9786226310840؛ عنوان: خونه‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ی پشتی؛ نویسنده: آنه فرانک؛ برگردان الهام دلاور؛ برگردان از متن انگلیسی ریچاردو کلاراونیستون؛ ویراستار محمدرضا مدنی‌بجنوردی؛ تهران، نشر جغد، 1397؛ در 375ص؛ شابک 9786009554912؛ عنوان: دفترچه خاطرات آنافرانک؛ نویسنده آنا فرنک؛ برگردان سعید گودرزی؛ تهران، بدرقه جاویدان؛ 1395؛ در 256ص؛ شابک9786005381122؛یادمانهای «آن فرانک»، یادداشتهای روزانه ی یک دختر نوجوان «یهودی» است، که در تابستان سال 1942میلادی، در بحبوحه ی جنگ جهانگیر دوم، در وحشت از نازی‌ها، مجبور شد همراه با اعضای خانواده‌ اش، در شهر «آمستردام»، به زندگی پنهانی روی آورند؛ به مدت دو سال «آن»، و پدر و خواهرش، با چهار «یهودی» دیگر، در آن پنهانگاه به سر بردند؛ «آن»، یادمانهای خویش را در دفترچه‌ ای، یادداشت می‌کرد؛ سرانجام نازی‌ها، همه‌ ی آن‌ها را دستگیر، و روانه ی اردوگاه‌های مرگ کردند؛ از آن هشت نفر، تنها پدر «آن فرانک»، جان سالم به در برد، و در پایان جنگ، یادمانهای دخترش را منتشر کرد؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 29/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 07/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Maybe the first thing that most people would get shocked is that I rate with only 3 stars one of the best selling books of the 20th century (and now 21st century too) and even more, a book about the Holocaust.First thing that I learned about this book is honesty.Anne Frank teaches us all about honesty, about telling what you really think, and so I am doing the same.For starters, I wonder how many people really, I mean REALLY read the book, because to rate with 5 stars a famous book that everybody tells you that it's a book that all people should read, and then they got in this commnunity for readers and maybe they feel the compromise to make the rest to think that you really read the book.If not the case, hey, I don't see why anyone can be offended by this comment, and it's true, I don't see either anyone who will complain, since to me it would be only a defense mechanism behind their own guilt of really not reading the book but making the rest that they did. I didn't think about this scenario but commenting about other thing with a reader friend, that thought stuck in my mind.I invested so much time in that because, one has to be honest, the book is tedious since it's not really a novel, it's a collection of diary writings without a coherent line of constructing a story, even you need editors' further notes to know what happened to the people in the Secret Annex since obviously, Anne was unable to tell the final events.So, since it's so tedious, I wouldn't be surprised that some reader tried to read it but at the end they just rated with 5 stars to denote that they are ""cultured"" readers that they appreciate the book as one of the most important books of the 20th century.Between the passages, you learn a lot of things. The first thing that surprised me it's how this diary collection that it was written in the 40's, in Holland, by a teenage girl, almost anybody can relate to the comments and you don't feel them as outdated.Sometimes if you read an ""old"" book, you sensed the outdated of the prose, selection of words, etc... but here I didn't feel it. This diary could be easily being written in present time and I don't think that it would change at all. I think that it was one of its strengths since I am sure that it will be as relevant for many more time.Other thing that surprised me a lot was how much Anne Frank (and by association, the rest of the group in the Secret Annex) were informed about the events in the war, I know, they had a radio, but from stuff that I had read about WWII, there were certain elements of the information that people weren't aware.I mean, at many moments, they denote a certainty that Jewish people were murdered in the extermination camps, of course if you call them ""extermination camps"", of course you know that people got killed there, but that's a term used by me, now, they called them labor camps, and so far I read, Jewish people really thought that they will receive ""baths"" when they were really gassed or burned to death, and it's kinda logical thing since if they were so certained about their deaths, there would be riots on the ghettos to flee in mass and they wouldn't march without protest to the gas chambers and the ovens. Even, Allied forces used espionage methods to know from Nazi prisoners what was happening to the Jewish people on the camps.Anyway, also, there are elements like the assasination attempt to Hitler that they were aware that it was made by their own generals. I don't think that kind of stuff would be informed so easily since it was a clear fact of how divided was the opinions of the high ranking staff of the Third Reich.I am not saying that the diary is not authentic as some dumb people commented that the Holocaust didn't happen.The Holocaust happened.It was real and we never forget that to avoid that it would happen again. I am just commenting that surprised me how well they were informed about key sensitive info of war events taking in account that they were a bunch of people living hidden for like 3 years in an isolated annex of a building. I know, they got visits by the people that helped them but even so. I am not questioning its authenticity, just expressing my surprise when I read it. There were other things here and there that I was surprised by the use of terms like ""diet: low fat"", geez! I didn't know that in the 1940's they used terms like that in the 1980's were like the rush of ""healthy food"", but again, I supposed it's the effect that stuff that we think are new, they are just recycled and labeled as ""new"".I am amazed that this book is banned in some schools, okay, there are comments relating to sex and sexual preferences, but so what? If a teenage girl from the 1940's can think about stuff like that while she was isolated with a war outside, don't you think that teenagers of today can think just the same? I think that books like this one can help them to know that they are not alone, that they are not weird for thinking things like that, that was normal in the 1940s and it's normal now too.I was amazed that the group tried to ""live normal"", I mean, kids making school work and so. I think that in such extraordinary circumstances, they needed to do extraordinary things like to make circles and to talk in group and hearing all about topics. I mean, they were like trapped and living together, really too close in the sense of physical space and yet, nobody cares about what Anne thinks or what she has to offer? Geez! Sure, they need to be really still and in silence, usually at day, but they should like making a ""tribe"", I don't know, I am babbling, but to try to live like regular families was evidently wrong for the sanity of their interrelationships.What didn't surprised me were behaviors like trying to hide food or keeping money from the group. In times where the group work were essential to survive, the human selfishness risen as a second nature.Resumming, I just want to explain that my rating is based on my ""entertaining"" experience while reading the book and the format of the book itself.And this didn't have to do with my respect for the subject of the Holocaust and its terrible events.!121!A sad, very important work That´s a sociological and psychological study toHow Frank describes both the outside world and the complex, inner relationships between the involved humans, is one of the essential elements of the book. One other are the  Thoughts and feelings of a teenagerIn a world that totally lost control over sanity and humanity. The descriptions of the Holocaust are what the work is most known for, but especially for young female readers, it´s also an interesting work about becoming a woman in conservative times. That´s the forgotten element, that Even the normal traditions of that time seem bizarre by nowaday standardsBecause it was also the beginning of the time of breaking the sexism, cultural norms, and discriminations women faced for millennia. So what Anne´s family believes, thinks, and says is an as important element as the genocide going on outside. If it would have been written by a boy, it would be more interesting for the male audience. But no matter the age, gender, or social group, descriptions of  Totalitarian atroticitiesWill always be haunting when the disaster is over. Most of the famous works of that genre come from Germany or Russia because of the bloody history, but there may have been thousands of hidden, secretly written manuscripts by prosecuted people that have been burned together with the authors over the centuries. Exactly this moment this is happening all around the world in the dozens of dictatorships that torture, intern, and kill unknown numbers of dissidents each day. That´s one of the things people living in Western democracies tend to forget. That the terror isn´t over yet.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...!121!There really isn’t anything I can add that many other reviews haven’t already done. It’s a five star read because it is important, because it is real and because the holocaust is something we should never forget.!121!It happened. That thing, the reason I have put off reading this, happened. My heart broke. And I knew it would. Sure, I had heard of Anne Frank, I knew who she was, what she did, what happened. She is a historic figure, and a tragic one certainly. But I didn't make the really personal connection until I read her words, this diary. Her words bring her to life again. What a precocious young girl, so smart, so full of life; a life with so much promise, so much hope. She thinks, even writes, very much like a young girl would today. I think that's why so many young people feel a connection with her still. It's not a great work of literature. It can be tedious at times, even repetitive. But it's an important contribution to history. It tells a story that needs to be told again and again, not forgotten. Yes, Anne's words do give her life, and they will break your heart. But more importantly they resonate across time and around the world, and I expect they always will.!121!I never knew that a book could make me so emotional until I read this memoir for the first time during my high school days. Every time I was quarantined during this pandemic, I thought about Anne Frank and her family. When I found it difficult to stay indoors for just 14 days during each quarantine, the Frank family had to hide in the Secret Annex for two long years. That too at the backdrop of the world war and the holocaust. This young lady had to go through many horrible conditions in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Anne Frank shows us the horrors of one of the most brutal acts of cruelty in world history and the importance of freedom in a human being's life. This is a must-read book for everyone.!121!Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.

One cannot fathom what other marvelous books the world might have known had this talented, perceptive girl been permitted the life she was due. ""We don't want our belongings to be seized by the Germans, but we certainly don't want to fall into their clutches ourselves. So we shall disappear of our own accord and not wait until they come and fetch us.""""But, Daddy, when would it be?"" He spoke so seriously that I grew very anxious. ""Don't worry about it, we shall arrange everything. Make the most of your carefree young life while you can."" That was all. Oh, may the fulfillment of these somber words remain far distant yet!Fifteen months later . . .The atmosphere is so oppressive, and sleepy and as heavy as lead. You don't hear a single bird singing outside, and a deadly close silence hangs everywhere, catching hold of me as if it will drag me down deep into an underworld.!121!This is a powerful must read. It makes me wonder how many other diaries like this were written during the war that were lost during the holocaust, destruction of cities, purging of Jewish living spaces, etc. It is amazing that this narrative on life in hiding made it through and can represent all those who were in hiding and whose voices were never heard.I knew the story of Anne Frank before reading this book. In fact, I may have read some or all of it back in high school, but I cannot remember for sure. Back around 2006 or 2007 I took a trip to Europe and had a chance to visit the Anne Frank House. Unless you get a chance to visit in person, it is hard to understand exactly what the conditions were like and the size of the space. Anne Frank did a good job describing, but seeing is believing!Another interesting thing about reading this now is that we are in the middle of the Coronavirus quarantine. While many of us get a bit of cabin fever being asked to stay home, reading Anne Frank’s words about being trapped in a small space for two years because of fear of death if found really puts it into perspective. But, at the same time, this might be a good time to revisit or read it for the first time because her frustrations with her family and situation may be a bit more understandable for those who have barely left the house in months.When the book first started, I wondered how accurate Anne’s descriptions were. She was an angsty and outspoken teenager which made me wonder what was true and what was just her perspective. For example, the first few chapters are mainly her complaining about her parents, other adults, and people she did not like from school. However, I think this part of the diary is important because it shows her growth throughout the story as the situation becomes more dire and she is forced to mature before her time. I cannot say that this book will be enjoyed by everyone – especially if biographies are not your thing. Also, the subject matter and the situation the Frank’s are in may be difficult for some to handle. But, it is an important document from World War II history and is worth reading no matter who you are.!121!The problem with Diary of a Young Girl is that it's the diary of a young girl, and young girls are, like young boys, kindof a pain in the ass. It's like 300 pages straight of ""No one understands me!"" I guess the reason this made it on to so many high school curricula is that young people might relate to it, and clearly some of them do, because they wrote pissed-off comments below this review - but this doesn't depict the horrors of the Holocaust. Night does that. This depicts the boredom of being locked in an attic for two years. And Frank is very bright, but not bright enough to make great reading out of a kid's diary.In the pantheon of literature about being locked in an attic, Flowers in the Attic is still the gold standard.!121!Dear Mom and Dad, Dear Friends,That’s my end. They have come to take me to be shot. To hell. Dying at the utmost of victory is a little unfortunate, but what cares? The importance of an event is just in human’s mind. Pierre Benoit/ February 08, 1943/ Free interpretation from Letters of Those Who Were Being Shot. A letter to Anne FrankMy Dear Little Girl,Until today, it has never occurred to me that going through a page of a book into the last page was so annoying and distressing. I have read too many books that its author has left it in the middle but any open ending and unfinished one hasn’t been so painful for me. If I read the book disregarding your story, it is nothing more than the personal notes of a freshly mature girl: description of unimportant stories, the passionate feelings of adolescence and nags about food and living conditions during the Second World War. But now that I know what happened to you, will I can leave easily your wishes, the future you imagined for yourself, your dreams and hopes without grief and tear? You wished to be devoted to something, you wanted to be useful and make joy for all those who you might never saw. You wanted to live even after your death. Although your memories didn’t end the way you wanted, Although the story of your grey but hopeful days remained unfinished, I followed your unwritten story up to the top of Auschwitz chimneys, until the Bergen-Belsen mass graves. Your wish came true. You are a symbol of innocence, hope and depredated childhood for me and thousands of others. Though you lost your life, your love to the life, to the tree, to the sky has become a power in our heart to fight that part of human nature which took the living chance from you to not portray your fate in other children; To you and Peter be the last children of human being who were drawn to the cross of injustice and discrimination. Yes, we swore and we will stand up to the day that human being is the helper of the other one.

Shortly after her birthday with the fear that her older sister, Margo may be taken by the Nazis the Franks disappear into the night and go into hiding. It is through Kitty that Anne records her thoughts and daily life living behind a bookcase in the secret annex.When I was younger I went through a ""holocaust"" phase before moving on to Harriet Tubman and slavery. The funny thing is that Anne Frank's Diary was not the first Holocaust book I read, I think that was The Devil's Advocate. Anyway,I soon became fascinated by the Secret Annex and the secluded life she lived for two years. Unfortunately she and the other occupants of the Annex were betrayed and sent to concentration camps with only her father Otto Frank surviving. The tragic thing (not to minimize the inhumanity of it all) is that Anne died mere weeks before liberation. Anne's dream was to have her diary published after the war and after liberation her father saw that happen, making Kitty a time capsule to an unfathomable past.

Support freedom of expression by reading and buying banned books! ❤️📚!121!While her story is sad, the naked Emperor cult around this book is unmerited.The key quotation about people being basically good at heart is absurd in the light of the story, and from a theological perspective, just plain wrong.!121!This book was given to me by my Rabbi as a gift on my confirmation. My edition is so old, you can't even find it. It is a Modern Library Book edition with an introduction by Eleanor Roosevelt. It doesn't mean that I am that old (although I am old-ish), but, the copyright is 1952 (I will say I wasn't born then). I still have this book. So this book is very personal to me. For a past I experienced growing up in a very prejudiced neighborhood. The anti-semitic past and hatred I endured living in Southern California. So a lot of times, I had to hide that I was Jewish. To protect myself. And it is especially hard to see the hatred in today's world. I don't practice Judaism today. But it is my history. It is a part of me. And my ancestors have endured a lot. So, yes, this book, Anne Frank's experience, it is personal. Premise: the diary of a young girl beginning on her 13th birthday (6-12-42). {Interesting that I am posting this review on the date that would have been celebrating her birthday 81 years later.} The diary ends August 1, 1944.Despite all that was going on around her, Anne was a happy and cheerful person. She was talkative and inquisitive. She was challenged as a teenager, and didn't always understand everyone or the situation, but she still had a great sunshine spirit. I think this was another reason the Rabbi felt this was an important book to share with us young ones as we were entering our commitment to Judaism. He not only wanted us to understand what it meant to be a Jew, and the sacrifices of those before us, but the joy of a good positive attitude - despite the circumstances they endured. I'm not sure that always worked for me. I questioned why the Jews didn't fight back. Why they allowed themselves to be shuttled into camps so easily once they knew that was what was happening. And as I questioned, I was reminded of the deepness of their religious beliefs of love and fellowship and the goodness and belief in humanity. Thank you Anne.We need to get back there again. Love. Fellowship. Goodness and belief in humanity. Yes?!121!Ya gotta hand it to this teen girl who was writing about her life with such clarity and eloquence when her life was hanging by a thread.I've read reviews of The Diary of a Young Girl that complained about how Frank ignored the bigger picture of the war and that her subject matter was trite, whiny and insular. What else could it be, this diary of a teen secreted away in the compact environs of an attic with the same people for years learning little-to-no outside information?From the standpoint of a detached, pure read, the fact that the diary includes a love interest is a blessing. But even without it, it's a wonderful and at times intense read. There were numerous times when the family was nearly caught during which my heart would race uncontrollably and my breath would catch. Knowing what happens to all of them after the diary ends packs the kind of punch you get in fiction...only it's not.!121!آن فرانک عزیزمن دفترچه خاطرات تو رو نزدیک به یازده هزار کیلومتر دورتر از مخفیگاهت در هلند و ٧۵ سال بعد از اینکه نوشتیش خواندم. شگفت انگیزه، نه؟بگذار این رو هم بهت بگم که سال ها عکس تو روی کتابت (آره، تو واقعا یک نویسنده شدی!) بهم زل زده بود و من اتفاقی سالی رو برای خوندنت انتخاب کردم که خودم دارم توی یک جور قرنطینه زندگی می کنم. برای همین شاید فقط کمی بهتر درکت کردمبا خودم می‌گفتم اگر تو تونستی توی یک خونه‌ی کوچک با پنجره‌های تیره شده، غذای کم، کنار هفت نفر آدم و با وجود ترس از مرگ و بمباران، ٧۶١ روز دوام بیاری و زندگی کنی، من حتی نباید گلایه کنم. چطور تونستی همه‌ی اون روزها امیدت رو حفظ کنی؟ چطور تونستی درس بخونی، عاشق بشی و زندگی کنی، وقتی خرابی و نابودی همه‌ی جهانت رو گرفته بود؟آن عزیزم، جنگ جهانی تموم شد و ای کاش فقط چند هفته بیشتر زنده می‌موندی تا پایانش رو ببینی. آره اون جنگ تموم شد ولی درد تموم نشد. اصلاً مگه میشه تموم شدنی باشه؟ تو همیشه به ذات خوب انسان‌ها باور داشتی و منم مدت هاست که دارم سعی می‌کنم باورم رو حفظ کنم، ولی یک رازی رو بهت بگم؟ فکر می کنم مدتیه که دیگه اینطور فکر نمی‌کنم و فقط نمی‌خوام بپذیرمراستش رو بخوای گاهی با خودم فکر می‌کردم که این نوشته‌ها شخصی بوده و شاید هرگز دوست نداشتی که همشون خونده بشن. ولی وقتی فهمیدم که نویسنده و ژورنالیست شدن بزرگترین آرزوی تو بوده، خوشحال شدم که حداقل بعد از رفتنت بهش رسیدی. تو نوشته‌هات رو برای دختر خیالی‌ای به نام کیتی می نوشتی، حالا میلیون‌ها کیتی حرف های تو گوش کردند و همدم تو شدند. شاید اون زمان که از افکار خاص و متفاوتت می‌نوشتی، فکر می‌کردی که هرگز کسی تو رو درک نمی کنه. ولی فقط لازم بود زمان بگذره تا کیتی‌هایی که تو رو می‌فهمند از راه برسندازت ممنونم که نوشتی. من همیشه اعتقاد داشتم که نوشتن بزرگترین جادوگری دنیاست و وقتی نوشته‌های تو رو توی دستام گرفته بودم و به صدات که بعد از این همه سال شنیده میشه گوش میدادم، بیشتر از همیشه بهش ایمان آوردممائدهتهران-٢٠٢١کانال تلگرام ریویوها و دانلود کتاب‌ها و صوتیشون Maede's Books ٩٩/۱۰/۲۲!121!En mi humilde opinión, es un poco extraño calificar este libro como literatura. Mientras lo leía, era como leer un diario, nada más. Lo que vivió ella fue terrible, a pesar de que siempre dentro de todo lo malo -la guerra- siempre hubo una pequeña luz de alegría en su vida -Peter-. Lo peor de todo, es que estoy casi convencido que lo que escribió Ana fue algo común en muchas niñas y niños, adultos y adultas de la época, aunque suene frío, este es sólo un caso más de los muchos que hubo.La historia conmueve, por cierto, y es muy fácil entrar en el mundo de Ana mirado desde su perspectiva infantil/pre-adolescente. Era una niña muy inteligente, estaba al tanto de todo lo que pasaba con respecto a la guerra a pesar de su edad, y también se daba cuenta de las conversaciones de adultos que se llevaban a cabo en ""El Anexo"".Respecto a la veracidad de éste, hay unos que dicen que es un invento, yo no lo creo así, y si así fuera, quizás inventaron que una tal Ana Frank escribió un diario, pero de seguro esta misma historia le pasó a más de alguno.Hay un museo de Ana Frank en Amsterdam el cual tuve la oportunidad de visitar, así que creo y quiero creer que este diario efectivamente existió, quizás sólo le cambiaron unas que otras oraciones.¿Vale la pena leerlo? Absolutamente, es un libro/diario muy fácil de entender y seguir. Libro ""liviano"".!121!I'm the daughter of German Jews. My mother's family came from Berlin and my father's from Frankfurt. Yes, the same Frankfurt as the Franks. They were a very old German family --- there is still an Edinger Institut at the University begun by my great grandfather, and Edinger Strasse, and other vestiges of my family's existence there. Moreover I still have relatives in Germany, those who came from lines where people had converted. Anyway, my father (whose father did not leave Germany and was eventually deported and killed) became an academic specialist in German politics and I spent several years of my childhood in Germany. One year was 7th grade. Before we left my father's mother gave me Anne Frank's diary and a diary. Later, upon visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and seeing her original diary, I realized that mine was just like hers. I mean, just like. Clearly my grandmother had given me one she had bought in Frankfurt and Anne's must have also been from Frankfurt, bought around the same time. They are identical other than a difference in coloringBut the diary was what woke me up to the Holocaust as well as to what it was to be a teenager. Anne's voice still echoes in my mind these many years later.!121!I'm really surprised by the number of people who thought this book was boring. I could understand how an adult man might find the musings of a young girl rather dull, but how can people in general not find this journal utterly fascinating? Here is a teenage girl who up until the end wrote with the same emotional consistency as when she began. Whoever thinks this books is boring is because they simply fail to realize, or even imagine the conditions in which this diary was written under. To think how this young girls personal life continued beyond the details of the war is rather remarkable. What would anyone else have written about in their diary as young boy or girl in the same predicament as the Franks? Anne is surprisingly strong and mature for her age, impressively intelligent, and although there was a World War going on, her own particular world never abated. Her personal life was just as important, if not necessary in order for her to survive the day to day living conditions at the Annex.Yes, there were brief moments of panic, but she had to live life, even if her living space was limited. She carried on as if being in hiding was a mere temporary inconvenience. She wasn't going to let that rob of her of her right to claim her passage into womanhood..her God given right to experience puberty, moodiness, emotions, and even love. Here I thought I was about to read the semi-interesting scribbles of a blooming young lady, with ambiguous references to the war. But there is nothing cryptic about her diary. She shoots straight from the hip in this incredibly and shockingly honest account of what life was like for her and her family living in hiding during the WW. It's not what I expected at all. I expected something rather tame, but it's far from it. This young girl was very interesting and quite special. You can't read this journal and think it's just an ordinary diary of a young girl, because it's not. Anne's diary is a representation of how other Jewish families lived and coped during the Nazi war. That's a pretty powerful thing. Many people don't realize how fortunate we are (thanks to Anne Frank, her Father Otto Frank and Miep Gies) to have some insight on how it must have been for the Jews to coexist this way. Because of Anne, we have an idea of how it was like to live under floorboards, in between walls, and behind bookshelves. This diary humanizes and brings back to life the Jewish people who mysteriously disappeared but who had not yet died. I love this diary and I'm so grateful to have read it.It must have been extremely difficult for her father Otto Frank to read his daughters diary after her death.!121!This is an autobiography based on Anne Frank's diary. Even today after 73 years this book is widely famous among us.  What makes this book so special? Well, this book was never written to get published, or even that someone will ever read it for that matter. If you write a diary entry you must be familiar with the unfiltered, raw, and original emotion behind writing it. As this was not a planned book, so there is no unexpected twist but this book is worth a read. Please don't presume it to be a sad story, Anne Frank was a very jolly person which you can see in her little stories that she shared every day with her diary ""Kitty"". I was so amazed to notice how a teenager's writing can be so strong and thoughts can be so clear. It inspires me that even after so much chaos and fear around how positive and hopeful she was.Grab your copy here or here.!121!""I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support.""Dear Anne, I hope what you confided in the diary, what we millions of readers around the world read today, will be a source of comfort to you, knowing that we are in awe of your courage, strength, and the magnitude of your faith. We can't begin to imagine what you and the rest of the members of the annex, as well as those others who were in hiding, had to go through: The constant fear of being discovered, the anxiety that comes from the uncertainty, the dire living conditions having to coup up in a small space for years end. And after all those sufferings, you had to be a victim and not a victor. That broke my heart, Anne. To tell you honestly, Anne, I read your diary as if in a dream. I knew beforehand that it will be an emotionally taxing journey, not only because of what you've written but because I knew the end. So perhaps reading it as if in a trance maybe my way of protecting me from breaking down. But occasionally, when my veil of protection was shaken, I felt an icy cold gripping my heart. The discriminations and the horrors your people had to endure, and also the horrors the rest of the people in occupied countries had to endure, were too cruel to be true. But they truly happened. They did happen. And we live in that same world where at one point some deemed it right to exterminate one race! It's just appalling. But, while I felt all this Anne, you were optimistic. ""Beauty remains even in misfortune. If you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance... A person who has courage and faith will never die in misery"". Your diary is truthful. It tells us how the eight of you lived nearly two years couped up in the ""secret annex"". You tell us how crowded it can be, and the quarrels between people who live in such close proximity. Then you describe the emotional strain of living closed up with constant fear and anxiety. You were a brave girl, Anne. But even you despaired at times. ""I've asked myself again and again whether it wouldn't have been if we hadn't gone into hiding, if we were dead now and didn't have to go through this misery. But we shrink from this thought. We still love life, we haven't yet forgotten the voice of nature, and we keep hoping.."" At times it was hard to read your words, Anne; the words full of life, hope, and faith. You hoped for the invasion to come, to rescue you, and to allow you once again to step into the free world. But fate intervened before that. After forming a close connection with you and the other members in the annex through your diary, it was hard to digest that none except your father made it through to the free world. But I'll tell you this, Anne. Remember what you wrote in your diary about not wanting to be forgotten. You wrote ""I can't imagine having to live like all the women who go about their work and are then forgotten. I want to go on living even after my death!"". You are not forgotten and even after your death, you're living in millions of readers' hearts. You wanted to be an author. And you are one, through your diary. So dear Anne, in a way, you accomplished your goal. And I'll tell you this also, Anne. You are a beautiful soul. ""I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart"".  Only you could have said that having to live through such injustice and cruelty. You wrote once, Anne that ""ten years after the war people would find it amusing to read how we lived"". But it is not amusing; it is heartbreaking. Only people who had similar experiences could truly know the physical suffering and mental agonies of such living. The rest cannot even imagine. At least, you are now in your eternal rest. You cannot be touched by any sort of suffering now. That is a comfort to my burdened heart. I'll now say my farewell to you. But before I go, I have a confession to make. Anne, I bought your diary at Auschwitz. It may be looked at as a cruel trick played on you, selling your story at a place you suffered much. But to tell you the truth, Anne, I see it as a tribute to you and all the holocaust victims who died without their voices being heard. And I sincerely hope you'll feel the same.!121!Book Review

4 out of 5 stars to The Diary of a Young Girl, written during the 1940s by Anne Frank. Many are first exposed to this modern-day classic during their middle or high school years, as a way to read a different type of literature from that of an ordinary novel. In this diary, young Anne express her thoughts (both positive and negative) over a two-year period during which her family and friends are in hiding during World War II and the Holocaust. For most of us, this is one of the few ways we can actually read or hear the words from someone who was actually there and went through this, especially if you don't know anyone who was alive during this time period in the 1930s and 1940s in Germany and the surrounding areas. I read this in my 9th grade English course, and I remember disliking it a lot. Not because of the way it was written or published, but due to the topic. I dislike anything about that time in history. But I later re-read it and had a different level of appreciation for the value a book of this type can bring. Unlike The Book Thief, it's raw and natural in its words. But where I love The Book Thief because of its story, I found this one a bit harder to digest. It's not this extraordinary novel by any means, at least to me, but given how it came about, what happened to her and the way she expresses everything, it is definitely a great book. Everyone should read some passages from it at some point in their life.

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Paperback),Yuval Noah Harari,4.36,1015092,2011,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.","Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a book bound to appear on a large number of coffee tables and favorite lists, and be picked up even by those who normally would not find the time for reading. It will certainly not be the next A Brief History of Time, which is often named as the world's top unfinished popular bestseller.Both A Brief History of Time and Sapiens share a similar, worthy goal - to explain complex issues in a way which can actually be understood and comprehended by most people. Just as A Brief History... aimed at explaining cosmology to a lay audience, Sapiens aims to provide a readable and concise historical summary of the progress of human evolution - all in under 500 pages.Is this possible? Of course not - histories of individual countries often take up several volumes, and histories of entire civilizations and ultimately an entire specie would take up hundreds if not thousands of volumes. Because Harari's book is limited to just a single volume (and a relatively short one at that), he has to severely limit his scope to what he considers to be the biggest life-changing developments of our species, which essentially reduces it to a collection of trivia about these events. But that's not the true flaw of the book. Sapiens begins strong enough with a very interesting presentation of early human history and development of early human species, which culminated in the rise and eventual dominance of our own - the Homo Sapiens. However, the rest of the book consists largely of author's own musings and thoughts about the human condition and character - while some of these thoughts I find interesting and agreeable (such as our collective belief in the value of money), one thesis he that he put forward struck me as truly bizarre.Basically, Harari considers the agricultural revolution to be ""history's biggest fraud"", which instead of improvement left humans who settled down to farm worse off and more miserable than their nomadic, foraging ancestors. To prove his point, Harari waxes poetics about hunter-gatherers and their daily existence: they lived in egalitarian communes where property and love was freely shared, and were much more adept at survival in the wilderness than their descendants who plowed the fields. Hunter-gatherers had to have a much larger knowledge of their surroundings, and possessed vastly superior mental reflexes and physical dexterity which put future generations to shame. Although we have since gained vast knowledge as a collective, Harari argues that on the individual level ancient foragers were ""the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history"".For Harari, our foraging ancestors were not only mental and physical supermen, but also enjoyed a much more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than all the subsequent peasants, workers and office clerks. They worked fewer hours and since they had no homes, they also had no household chores; this allowed for plenty of free time to play with one another, tell stories and just hang out. Since foraging necessitated exploration, it also provided plenty of adventure: what better thing to do than explore new places to look for cool plants and other edible things? Because they were always on the move and therefore not dependent on a single source of food, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a superior, multi-nutrient diet and were less likely to suffer from hunger and starvation than subsequent agricultural societies, which often depended on a single crop, and not only were receiving much less nutrients but also suffered heavily from famines when their food source failed. Farming? Bah! Humbug.True, there were some drawbacks, Harari reluctantly agrees. Although some lucky souls made it longer, life expectancy averaged only 30 to 40 years. Children dropped dead like flies, and sometimes wild tigers came out of the bushes and ate you and your whole family and tribe. Not to mention that sometimes you and your band wandered and wandered, and the food simply wasn't there. Or even worse - the food was there, but so was another tribe which was not exactly keen on sharing their already limited supply. What about this? ""It would be a mistake to idealize the lives of these ancients"", says the author, though I do not really understand why, since this is exactly what he appeared to be doing, ""though they lived better lives than most people in agricultural and industrial societies, their world could still be harsh and unforgiving."" Ain't that the truth. Sometimes, life is just hard. Rocks fall, everyone dies. But agricultural revolution? It sucked, Harari argues. First, he has unnamed (and presumably fictitious) scholars proclaim the development of agriculture as ""a great leap forward for humanity"", which ""produced ever more intelligent people(...)able to decipher nature’s secrets"". But this is not true - ""there is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time"", he says, as ""foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered"". As I mentioned above, Harari states that agricultural revolution made things worse for farmers - it robbed them from excitement of hunting and gathering by forcing them to settle down next to their fields and perform menial farm work, which strained our joints and spine. Although farming provided a surplus of food it did not provide the farmer with a better diet, robbing us of the diversity of meals experienced by a hunter-gatherer. Farming also failed to provide us with economic security - crops can always fail and lead to hunger, whereas hunter-gatherers can always move on and hunt for other types of food (unless, of course, they do not find any and starve to death). Farmers also had to stay and defend their land if attacked by a hostile group, whereas foragers could always escape to another area, look for food there, and survive (they could, of course, end up not being able to escape -who can fight or run on an empty stomach? - or...not find any food, and starve to death).So, what exactly has agriculture ever done for us? Since it has taken so much not only from our fathers but also from from our fathers' fathers, what has it ever given us in return? The aqueduct? Sanitation? Wine? And why have humans not returned to hunting and gathering but stubbornly toiled their fields and broke their miserable backs, while they could be climbing trees and camping in the wilderness? The answer is simple: more food allowed women to have children more often, and even though they still died fairly often this time births outpaced deaths several times. Village population increased, and soon entire generations of people no longer remembered the good old days of running in the forests and looking for berries. ""The trap"", Harari writes, ""was shut"".He goes on to say: ""Since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement"".Yet, we are wrong in thinking this, because ""it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today"" (though apparently not when it comes to foraging, which was a blast by all accounts - that is, the author's). Harari neglects to mention the exact reason why the agricultural revolution took place - farming first arose in places where hunting and gathering was no longer possible, and in the long run prevailed as the better option. Hunter-gatherers simply did not choose to one day walk out of the woods and start domesticating animals and plants; they were forced to do that because the environment they were living no longer allowed for foraging to remain a viable option. The Younger Dryas interval in ancient Levant is often linked to the adoption of agriculture in the region, as an example of the first deliberate cultivation of plants. People understood that seeds developed into plants at the time when they desperately needed to increase their food supply in order to survive, and linked one with the other.It is interesting that Harari does not only romanticize hunting and gathering, but actually looks at the agricultural revolution and its impact from a perspective of a hunter and gatherer - that is, focusing on the thing that mattered most to our foraging ancient ancestors: food. Hunter-gatherers spend their lives pursuing food; as Harari admits, because of their nomadic lifestyle they had very few possessions, as they were constantly moving around in search for food to sustain them. Food was their driving force; their lives centered around food, as they never had a steady supply of it and always had to hunt and look for more if they were to survive. In contrast, agricultural revolution provided humans with a steady and regular supply of food, and or the first time in our history allowed humans to take our minds off food and constant travel. The impact of this is monumental and cannot be stressed enough. Basically, without agricultural revolution, our knowledge would be stagnant - as we would simply not have the luxury of time to develop it. Food surplus and settling down allowed humans to think more and develop new ideas and technologies, allowing for more efficient farming - which in turn allowed for more time to think and develop even more ideas and technologies. In contrast to general knowledge of our forager ancestors, surplus of food and settler lifestyle allowed for skill specialization, which in turn allowed us to do things beyond their wildest dreams, and become technologically advanced. Basically, I would argue that societies comprised of hunter-gatherers cannot advance and live up to the full human potential - it is impossible to have a truly technologically advanced nomadic society, while it is possible to have a technologically advanced settler society which is able to send some of its members into the world as hunter-gatherers. To put it very simply: hunter-gatherers live in the wilderness, living day to day on what they find or hunt down, while agriculturists discover penicillin, split the atom and fly into space.Although the author later brings up valid concerns about our treatment of animals and abuse of collective power, his rant against agriculture is truly bizarre considering that without it he would not be able to write this very book. It's as if he disregarded the very Sapiens which he aimed to describe, and which has defied his thesis by abandoning hunting and gathering to settle down and farm. Still, there are good parts and certain valuable and interesting insights in this book - it's just a shame that it's tainted with such a weird and contrived chapter.!121!“The best-selling author is a gifted storyteller and popular speaker. But he sacrifices science for sensationalism, and his work is riddled with errors.” —Current Affairs—— This book is a superficial gloss on human history. Nice try but it excludes too much subject matter in favor of an overarching conceptual view to be deeply interesting. Stopped reading for reasons detailed below at p. 304 of 416.Considering the outlandishness of some of its claims—the downside of the Agricultural Revolution, the joys of Empire—the book seems weirdly under-sourced. The bibliography is beyond meagre. Don't get me wrong, I like a little informed speculation as much as anyone. Take for example the claim that houses, their advent, ""became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature."" (p. 99) I, for one, would be delighted to know how one can discern the psychology of someone who lived more than 9,000 years ago. The apparently relevant note cited is ""2 Robert B. Marks, The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Ecological Narrative"". But when one looks up Mr. Marks' book one sees that it pertains only to the 15th to the 21st centuries CE.Another thing, the book seems all biological determinism—and we know what that sort of thinking led to: the Konzentrationslager. The life of the mind is nothing here, the intellect nothing, all because it has no discernible basis in biology—so reductive and materialist, too. I'm hoping this is just a rhetorical device. Please, let it be. Moreover, the author cherishes a certain sneering and glib tone which I find annoying. Well, yes, now he's changing his tune, isn't he? But not before thoroughly pissing me off. Was that necessary? Ah, now he's starting to celebrate the very social constructs—the law, the state, joint stock corporations, etc.—that he so glibly belittled as ""imaginary myths"" a few pages back. So his earlier arguments were disingenuous. That's not something I prize in a writer. Notwithstanding the questionable attempt to raise the reader's hackles, just mentioned, I find myself on p. 170 and 95% of this is material I already know. Granted, the author tries to package it as felicitously as possible, but it's still stuff I know and, no doubt, material my well read GR friends will also know. What I had hoped for on cracking this formidable spine was something far more intellectually challenging, like Naipaul. Still, I find myself nursing a hope that this is just an overly long introduction to a thrilling thesis. At the same time I fear it will turn out to be another tedious read for a far less learned general reader than myself. Am I overqualified for this book? Trepidation abounds. 2.0 stars so far, inauspicious. Meh. It's really an undergraduate survey course, if that. It's a great review of common knowledge that seeks to find new linkages and epiphanies. It sometimes works. But often the linkages are specious. As when he terms liberal humanism a religion. It isn't, though it's a neat shorthand for his minimalist theories. Now I'm reading about how religions are unifiers. The author certainly has a flair for the obvious, I'll say that much. Here's an example of author Harari's reductiveness, which is inevitable in a book skirting so many vast subjects. On p. 232 we read: ""The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman."" Nietzsche is nowhere mentioned. The statement is wholly lacking in context—the Nazis are glossed but that's all. It really doesn't make coherent sense. Gloss, that's the word that best describes this book. A gloss.The writer is careless with metaphors. We're told that cultures are ""mental parasites,"" that ""history disregards the happiness of individuals"" and that ""history made its most momentous choice."" (p. 243-244). To say such things is to give agency to the non-sentient and adds to the narrative's by now utterly grating superficiality. Here's yet another bizarro statement:Had the Aztecs and Incas shown a bit more interest in the world surrounding them – and had they known what the Spaniards had done to their neighbors – they might have resisted the Spanish conquest more keenly and successfully. (p.292)Nonsense. The Spaniards had guns, germs and steel. Reread Jared Diamond and William H. Prescott, Mr. Harari. Foreknowledge would have availed the indigenous peoples little or nothing. The author goes on to admit as much in the paragraphs to follow, but why then wasn't that earlier sentence cut? But it gets better: If the subject peoples of the Inca Empire had known the fates of the inhabitants of Mexico, they would not have thrown in their lot with the invaders. But they did not now....[Thus] the native peoples of America...[paid] a heavy price for their parochial outlook.It's astonishing the author should use that ecclesiastical word. For what was the ostensible motivation of the conquerors but the glory of Christendom. Harari is blaming the victims. The world view of the Aztecs and Incas and others was limited. Harari blames them because they had not yet advanced beyond that basic if incomplete awareness. He then goes on to excoriate all of Asia and Africa for not having had the wherewithal to explore the world and conquer others. But these are cultural predilections, not standardized goals applicable to all. This leads to an unseemly West is the Best argument that's right out of Niall Ferguson's Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order. Is this book popular because it essentially functions as the West's cheering section? It's lovely we have developed science and technology and historiography etc. I'm glad I live in the West. But it's absurd to say that earlier cultures, because they did not develop in a timely manner our own particular brand of curiosity, were deficient. All cultures are blood soaked, our own included. The world is only what it is, not some counter-factual supposition.!121!I see many people complaining about the wild leaps of logic and the lack of footnotes - but honestly, what did you expect in a 500 page book, not even with small print, that's supposed to give you a summary of all history from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day? Personally, I thought the basic idea was terrific: the author has taken it upon himself to defend the Book of Genesis and show you that it's all true. I have seen creationists attempt the same thing and fail miserably, with their pseudo-scientific explanations of why the Earth is actually six thousand years old, how the Flood explains geology, etc. None of this nonsense for clever Dr Harari. He doesn't bother arguing about the places where science has obviously got it right (the Big Bang, plate tectonics, evolution), but takes them as givens. He doesn't get into the tangled reasoning about where a Creator might come into the picture; here, there is none. Instead, he cuts to the chase and gives you a story that's actually very interesting. About ten thousand years ago, people largely stopped being hunter-gatherers and started being farmers. This is usually presented by modern commentators as a Good Thing. But in Genesis, it isn't: we are expelled from the Garden of Eden and forced to eke out a miserable existence tilling the unforgiving soil, and now we have to live with the consequences. We have had the presumption to eat the fruit of the Tree so that we may become as gods, knowing good and evil. Harari ingeniously defends the idea that this, more or less literally, is what happened. We became farmers, then we started developing better technology, then we constructed cities, and finally, very recently, we invented science. We have made the most of our position as lords of creation, driving many species extinct and turning a few others into efficient machines for producing meat. But none of this has made us happier. In fact, as the Bible says, it's made us more and more miserable. We're evolutionarily adapted for being hunter-gatherers, not software engineers or stock traders. We are on the verge of learning how to conquer death and make ourselves immortal: but even then, we won't be as happy as we were back in the Garden. We'll more likely find new and even worse ways to cut ourselves off from our true heritage.Harari takes the position that our great strength as a species, the thing that sets us apart from all other living beings, is our ability to make up stories about things that are only to be found in our imaginations, and then treat them as though they were real; by this process, they become real. As he points out, empires and religions and money don't actually exist, but now they rule our lives. He's particularly interesting on the subject of money. Again, I can see some readers who dislike what they call his cheerleading for modern Western society. I don't think Harari is a fan of the West, and the book is in my humble opinion not Eurocentric at all; for example, Harari seems to like Buddhism rather more than Christianity. He's just pointing out the indisputable fact that Western society has taken over the world, and he ascribes that, more than anything else, to the West's ability to make up a better story about money, which we call capitalism. If this is where you're coming from, talking about the power of myth to transform human existence, you don't go overboard with the footnotes. There are no footnotes in the Bible. You do your best to tell a great story, and you hope that it will transform our existence.I think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos.[I also have a frivolous review of the book here.]!121!Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?
What a fantastic book. I can see why everyone from Bill Gates to Barack Obama was raving about it. It's an extremely compelling, accessible history - almost like a novelization - of humankind.I've read a few of these ""brief history of the world"" books, most notably  A History of the World in 100 Objects and Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything. I liked both, but neither is as engaging as this book. Also, Harari's book stays vague on the physics, dinosaurs and such, unlike Bryson's work, making this not so much about the whole universe, but specifically about humans. Or, I should clarify, homo sapiens.Most of all, I like how easy to digest the author makes all this information. I have a lot of respect for authors who can present something complex in simple terms. I've always liked the quote attributed to Einstein “If You Can’t Explain it to a Six Year Old, You Don’t Understand it Yourself”. Anyone with a thesaurus can make something seem more dense and complicated than it is; it's much harder to explain something long and complicated in a way that everyone can enjoy.And it does read like a really exciting and fascinating novel. Harari takes us through the history of human development and migration, through the Cognitive Revolution a sudden increase in cognitive ability around 70,000 years ago, not the 1950s intellectual movement and Agricultural Revolution. He looks at how currency and coinage developed, the creation of religions, the arrival of imperialism and capitalism, and the history of inequalities and injustices.I especially like how he presents a relatively unbiased view of events. He focuses on what we know, and is quick to say when something remains a mystery to biologists and anthropologists. When there are conflicting theories, he outlines all the main ones. The only agenda Hariri seems driven by is a desire to present the most accurate view of humanity's history.This book filled me with a sense of wonder. Wonder at how far we've come in just a few millennia; wonder at all the twisting roads of history; wonder at where we could possibly end up. The final chapters of the book take a peek at the future's possibility, making me even more excited (and a little scared) to read  Homo Deus.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube!121!It is again unpopular opinion time! It seems it becomes a rule for me not to enjoy a book that everyone seems to love. Well, someone has to. Here we go with the review. Prepare your tomatoes and raw eggs (someone actually threw a raw egg at me once for fun but it bounced from my bum )Sapiens’ beginning was fantastic. I loved the author’s voice and the information about the early days of the human kind was fascinating. I did not read any non-fiction about the origin of humans so I was excited to understand our origins better. I could not stop highlighting interesting passages to include in my review or to read later. Here are some of the ones that picked my interest.“It’s relatively easy to agree that only Homo sapiens can speak about things that don’t really exist, and believe six impossible things before breakfast. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”“Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals.”However, everything started to go downhill from somewhere in the middle of Part II. From an eager and excited reader I slowly became pissed off, disappointed and struggled to finish. I had several problems that plagued my reading experience and I plan to exemplify them below. First of all, I soon grew tired of the author’s ironic and condescending humor. His ego was transpiring from all his words and his personal opinions and the way he tried to enforce them annoyed me more and more. Secondly, I felt like many of his assumptions and extrapolations had no proof and they only represent the author’s personal opinion. For example, the way he supported for the whole book that humans were better of as hunter-gathers without bringing no real arguments to support his opinion.Finally, I had a problem with the scope of Sapiens. As the titles suggests, the book tries to be A Brief History of Humankind. I believe he did not succeed very well to do that and the reason is that it is quite impossible to do what the author planned in less than 500 pages. The task is too vast. The result is mix of everything with no structure, jumping from one subject to another and confusing the reader. The information was too vague, too general, it all resembled a set of interesting trivia.When reading other negative reviews of Sapiens I stumbled repeatedly on a recommendation: Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. The book was already on my TBR so it is going to be the next read on the subject. I hope it will be better.!121!Had I stopped reading after the first section, I’d have given this a five stars and whined that the Goodreads platform doesn’t aloe reviewers to go higher. But I didn’t stop. I kept reading, . . . until it got so bad, I found myself unable to do more than skim, and eventually, to just skipping large chunks.It starts out as a fascinating discussion of the development and rise of our species, homo sapiens. But starting in the second section on the Agricultural Revolution, Harari shift gears and drops any pretense of an scholarly work. From that point on, it’s all personal bias all the time. This guy absolutely hates human beings and society. It seems that he is completely stuck in the idea that the world would have been better off had humanity simply stayed put in the hunter-gatherer stage.It seems all the countless billions of humans who lived since then are deluded and don't get it, and that only he understands. Yeah, right!OK. There are worse sins than personal bias. Many great writers have it and let it show. But unlike Harari, the good ones work to try to justify the positions they take. Harari, on the other hand just bombards readers with one opinion after another and treats them as proven fact, even though what he says is often debatable or out and out wrong. That’s one of the reasons I gave up on a close reading as I progressed into the second half. Even when it seemed as if Harari was selling me something I didn’t know (which did not occur often), I simply did not trust him. An author can choose to forego many things. Credibility and trust are not among them.Perhaps the best way to illustrate this mess is through a conversation I once had among people who liked to discuss philosophy. Somehow or other, though, this conversation veered off into a set of irritating rants on how western society sucks. The thing that sticks out most in my memory is how the host went off on a diatribe about the greatness of nature and Native Americans and about how he was fine being a non-vegetarian because the cows understood human need for meat and were happy to offer themselves as a precious spiritual gift to humanity. My reply: “That conclusion is based on interviews with how many cows?” The conversation abruptly ended. That is exactly the way I reacted to the self-serving gibberish offered by Harari under the guise of scholarly presentation.!121!I believe I am relatively familiar with history in general, and I'm usually not very excited about reading more about it. But this book was something else. Beautifully written and easy to read, this book just made me want to know more and more about how the author thinks the world evolved to what it is today. Revolution by revolution, religion by religion, conception by conception, things were simplified and yet still maintained valid points - and it was never boring.The best thing about it was that it actually made me think.The author doesn't treat you as ignorant at all - he doesn't assume you know nothing but assume you know a lot and understand a lot, and doesn't lecture about anything, and that attitude makes the book a pleasure to read.Just read it.!121!This book had changed my life, the way I think, the way I precept the world.I think it should be an obligatory book for everyone on this planet.!121!History and Sociology for Dummies, this book is almost irrecoverably watered down intellectually. [and for all those commenters that think I am calling them dummies, I am simply referring to the popular XXX For Dummies books and I am not intentionally insulting folks that enjoyed the book.] Sapiens does make some interesting points and probably opens a few debates, but it disappointed me. There are lots of soundbites here, especially the oft-quoted one about the agricultural revolution being ""history's greatest ripoff"", but they remain soundbites because they never really reach a conclusion. The book starts out alright was the hunter-gatherer civilizations are discussed in some detail and without focusing exclusively on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Harari's chapters here did make for decent reading about the concept the author calls the cognitive revolution which separates us from other animals. Unfortunately, the next section about the agricultural revolution is a bit too polemical. Yes, it was a radical change and yes it did lead to new problems (disease, famine, etc), but without it, the human species would likely have never evolved to the point of me typing this text on my laptop and you reading it in a browser. There are not parallel paths proposed, just a vague condemnation of agriculture before he takes on the subject of religions. Here, he talks of the evolution of monotheism from the polytheistic systems that abounded before. I felt he did not discuss in sufficient death the animist systems (which still dominate Africa, South America, and the Arctic among others.) He seems to favor Buddhism (the pages there have a much more tolerant and fawning tone than those of the other religions) which seemed a little intellectually dishonest to me - I mean if he is trying to develop a dispassionate argument about how religions develop, he should not take a particular position without announcing it first. Anyway, after this, the book covers the industrial revolution and brings us up to modern times. Honestly, I felt that the end of the book really soured the whole product for me. Well, I was already annoyed with all the cute phrases and the prolific use of ""!"" at the end of 20% of the sentences (OK, I am exaggerating but seriously, a ""history"" book shouldn't use the exclamation point says the snob reviewer). But when the author sets up an argument about where we should be headed as a human race, he then goes off on bizarre tangents about cyber technology and refers to an obscure Project Gilgamesh (which unless I missed something major earlier in the book, he never mentioned before). I felt that the last chapter just came out of nowhere and made absolutely no sense. Perhaps, as other reviews here on GR have suspected, no one actually reads this book, preferring to leave it unsullied on their coffee table as a prop to their showoff intellectualism. In any case, it didn't do it for me.Unfortunately, my in-laws who bought me Sapiens also bought me the sequel so I suppose I will be guilted into reading it at some point. In conclusion, I prefer reading REAL history books with caffeine rather than this decaffeinated, saccharin substitute for them. I would highly suggest the more factual and far less polemical Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies which deals with a similar topic, but without the excessive punctuation (!).I am not alone in my disdain for this over-publicized waste of trees. A friend passed me this article: https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public... in which the author concludes: ""But Sapiens provides us with no resources for answering questions about the moral implications of scientific and technological change. A commitment to a reductionist, mechanistic view of Homo sapiens may give us some insight into some of the aspects of our past most tied to our material nature. But Harari’s view of culture and of ethical norms as fundamentally fictional makes impossible any coherent moral framework for thinking about and shaping our future. And it asks us to pretend that we are not what we know ourselves to be — thinking and feeling subjects, moral agents with free will, and social beings whose culture builds upon the facts of the physical world but is not limited to them.""This book is waaaaay overrated.As an aside, I wanted to briefly talk compare The Overstory and The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World with this book. In the Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, the author bemoans the wanton destruction caused by the agricultural revolution, but to my mind proposes no alternative and just leaves the reader with empty, vacuous soundbites. In the former two books, we are given a vast insight into how trees communicate and how they are intimately related to human beings. Yes, our ignorance of their speech (as alien to us as would be expected because our life spans and perception of time is on the same magnitude as that of flies to humans) has caused irreparable damage to the ecosystem. And there is an obvious domino effect: global warming and climate change. But, in the two books about trees, even if a militant outlook is shown to be a dead-end, it is demonstrated that being custodians of nature, we can help forests come back and preserve our biodiversity. It is not all of humankind that is to blame, as Harari would have us believe, but rather, rapacious grift driving large corporations which reap a direct, short-term financial benefit from wholesale environmental destruction. If the law was enforced rather than trampled upon, the jobs could be converted to conservation-related jobs and the forests could be preserved. I found that this positive message was stronger than any of the superficial aphorisms in Harari's book.!121!""what looks inevitable in hindsight was far from obvious at the time.""""Presumably, everyone reading this book is a Homo sapiens - the species sapiens (wise) of the genus Homo (man).""We 'sapiens' have diverse tastes when it comes to everything, so same goes for reading, and there are oh-so many options: many sub-genre's of fiction and non-fiction. We usually pick the one we enjoy the most - and that's fiction most of the time - and stick with it for good. But every now and then, there is that book - which isn't fiction - but it feels better than fiction. And then among those select few, there is that book, once read, one cannot help but recommend to others regardless of their favorite genre. Sapiens is one of those exceptional books. This book, I belive, is an excellent read, irrespective of what your usual favorite genre is.""As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.""This is kind of a history book, but it isn't the typical history book, intended to a niche of readers. The way the author narrates is quite fascinating, and unlike in the typcial non-fiction book, gives the reader the craving to finish it in one go. And the way everything's organized is well thought out the the flow is perfect. Once started, though the book is somewhat long, you will not feel tempted to skip over any parts of it. ""You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.""We start off with a brief introduction to how everything in the universe came to be around 13.5 billion years ago, and quickly navigate to around 70,000 years from present, where things escallate. Then comes the Cognitive Revolution, then through agricultural revolution to modern era.""historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial killer.""""We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.""The way how the social structures and various religions evolved was described in a very unique way. Typcially, we'd expect the author to explain along a particular school of thought, and explain reasons for accepting it to be the most reasonable way to look at things. But here, things are quite different. We are provided with different, and often contradicting, views on certain major historical aspect, while allowing us form our own opinions, which is kind of fun. And the subtle humor you encounter everywhere complements the flow nicely."" A wealthy man in ancien Egypy would never have dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.""But I guess this book is not for the history experts, for they might find things to be too simple. A connosiur of history might find the contents boring. However, for all others, this book has the ability to shift the way you look at the world quite profoundly."" 'Cooperation' sounds very altruistic, but is not always voluntary and seldom egalitarian.""You can't afford to miss reading this book. You shouldn't miss reading this book. You must read this book. This just became one of my all time favorites. DO GIVE THIS ONE A CHANCE...""A person who does not crave cannot suffer.""!121!Choose Your Fictions CarefullyThere are far too many fascinating assertions in this book to even mention. But for me the most fascinating is Harari’s idea of the Cognitive Revolution which took place about 70,000 years ago. ""We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes.""It is this mysterious, and as yet unexplained, change in human genetics that he pinpoints as the primary reason for the ultimate success of the species Homo Sapiens in competition not just with established flora and fauna but with other human forms. Interestingly, Harari’s argument also establishes the anthropological foundations for literary post-modernism.To over-simplify, but not by much, the Cognitive Revolution of Sapiens is precisely the ability to tell, and eventually read and write, stories, that is, fictional narratives which are interesting, entertaining, and above all convincing. This ability, an evolutionary enigma because it does not give obviously immediate advantage, underlies human ability to organize beyond very small units, to cooperate in matters of survival, and to prevail against competing species which are stronger, quicker, better adapted to the environment, able to speak in a more varied manner, and even more clever.These narratives, according to the narrative told by Harari, begin in gossip, talk among ourselves about ourselves, which is a behaviour that is now as far as anyone knows unique to Homo Sapiens, and may even have even been unique among others of the genus Homo. Gossip leads to shared tales about common experiences, ancestors, and problems. These tales evolve into myths which are widely shared and identify large groups as ‘us’. ""There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.""Such tales incrementally employ an increasing lexicon of fictional, that is to say abstract, ideas. It is these ideas which allow the ultimate success of Sapiens, not necessarily because of their pragmatic qualities, but because, whatever they are, they are shared: “Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail’s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.”As modern existential and linguistic philosophers have thought for some time, these ideas - scientific, religious, technological, social, legal - are fundamental fictions that become progressively indistinguishable from the ‘natural’ world which is apart from the imagined world of language. As Harari states what is a reiteration of this philosophical conclusion: “Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their imagination:... a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world... b. The imagined order shapes our desires... c. The imagined order is inter-subjective.”It is this invisibility of these linguistic fictions which constitute daily life that is both the greatest strength and greatest flaw of our species. We are able to organise ourselves, because of them, to travel to the Moon. We are also able to believe a half dozen untruths before breakfast. The internet is perhaps the best example of the paradox of our fraught existence since it promotes both cooperation and mass deceit. For me the implications are clear: 1) literature is the only hope for the world. Fiction - novels, fairy tales, fantasies, and lots of 'em - are the only means to get a grip on reality. Reading lots of fiction developes the aesthetic sense. And it is only through aesthetics that one can decide what is important and how to deal with what is important. 2) It is also clear to me that novels cultivated our species genetically over millennia for this very reason - to get us better at reading them.Postscript: For a rather plausible opposing view to Harari’s, see: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...!121!The book was too much a basic primer for me, at least to start with, but that's probably because I've read too many books on our origins biologically and culturally. Once the author had us settled into the civilization of cities he waxed romantically (as authors on this subject quite often do) on the life of the hunter gatherer and its perfection. (I've just finished Sebastian Junger's Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging and there was more of that.) If it was all so perfect then more of us would return to that ancient life style where people had more leisure, freedom and happiness according to Harari and Junger, neither of whom have given up their miserable materialistic lives for stalking around with a spear. The book got better. There were some good explanations of why we are as we are and how things developed, Such as human conversation evolving (see below) so we could gossip about our fellow tribes people. I didn't always agree with the author. But I always enjoy books like that to some extent because it gives me a different point of view, different reasons and things to think about. So this was good. But then it dragged at the end as the author got preachy and scifi technological about our bionic futures. At some time not in the unimaginable future, robots will think for themselves and be able to feel, and then they will supercede us... Yes well Asimov covered all that more than half a century ago. It's not going to happen we are too complex to duplicate. And anyway I can't see robots gossiping and if they don't do that what have they got to talk about the weather I suppose, if they were British robots. that will make them 'human'? If the desire to gossip gave us speech, then the inability to gossip puts us right back into the pre-sapiens world. Robots are retrogression. Bionic bodies though, that might be progress._________Written on reading the book. According to the author, basic vocal communication was solved by the primates. And although animals aren't supposed to have theory of mind, green monkeys have been heard calling 'beware there's a lion' when there's no such thing, they just don't want to risk losing or having to share food they've just found.Human conversation apparently evolved so we could gossip. As a social animal, we need to know whose screwing who, who ripped off who, and who lives in a really disgusting midden. Maybe the author's right. He also says that we are not a tolerant species. He got that right for true.!121!This book is simply outstanding, and I can indubitably say that this is the best non-fiction book I read this year. 

- This book discusses the whole of Human History. These are some interesting excerpts from it - “Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and refine their abilities, whether or not they have such an opportunity will usually depend on their place within their societies remained hierarchy.- Harry Potter is a good example. Removed from his distinguished family and brought up by ignorant muggles he arrives at Hogwarts without any experience in magic, and it takes him seven books to gain a firm command of his powers and knowledge of his unique abilities.- Even if people belonging to different classes develop exactly the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play the game by different rules.- If in British ruled India an untouchable, a Brahmin, a Catholic Irish man and a Protestant English man had somehow developed exactly the same Business acumen they still would not have had the same chance of becoming rich because the economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unofficial glass ceilings.”- It is sad to say that even though the world has progressed to a large extent in terms of latitudes for the weaker sections of the society based on race and cast, there is still a long way for us to go to say that each and every individual is treated equally and provided with equal opportunities like everyone else.- If you are a person who is more into fiction and plans to read just one non-fiction book this year, this should be the one you should pick.!121!”Despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles – but nobody knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction.”

Cave of the Hands. Cueva de las manos in Argentina. The art in this cave dates from 13,000 to 9,000 years ago. I find this photograph to be very emotional to think about because this band of Humans are saying...we were here.The pursuit of happiness is one of the many big themes that Yuval Noah Harari covers in this remarkable book about the history of Homo Sapiens. He brings us from the beginning of our known history to the present and offers his interpretations and evaluations of our conduct along the way. There are many points in the book where he crystallized my thinking about a subject, and there are several other points where he encouraged me to think about what I know in different ways. Since taking myself out of the rat race, I’ve had a lot of time to ponder exactly what I was trying to accomplish for the 30+ years I pursued money and career advancement. Now, I want to make sure with what time I have left to spend it pursuing something much more meaningful and satisfying than the pursuit of more and more money. This book will make you uncomfortable. You may disagree with some of his conclusions, but do not use that as an excuse to not read the book. He will also enlighten you on other points that very well may help shape your personal philosophy. I have been thinking about reading the book for some time, but what convinced me was all the one star reviews for the book on Amazon. It was quickly apparent to me that most of those reviews were written by religious people who never read the book but were told they should be offended by it because of his opinions on religion. He doesn’t just believe that Christianity is a fabricated construct, but also thinks that nationalism and a whole host of other -isms are as well. ”How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism?”Or how about this one?”It may well be that we’d all be better off if Christianity and Islam had been forgotten or defeated.”Why did Constantine the Great pick Christianity as the religion of the empire? We really don’t know. It was far from a dominant religion at the time. Harari compares it to a POTUS waking up one morning and deciding that the Hare Krishnas are the national religion. It is hard to fathom that it was a moment of altruism. He was an intelligent man and must have felt that Christianity offered the best way to better control his people and unite them under one concept, instead of the host of gods that polytheism offered. I come away from this book realizing how deeply brainwashed I’ve been about a whole host of issues, and I have been remiss in not questioning more of the foundations of thought or intent behind most of my long held beliefs. The big revelatory moment for me was when he talked about individualism. ”The state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused. ‘Become individuals,’ they said. ‘Marry whomever you desire, without asking permission from your parents. Take up whatever job suits you, even if community elders frown. Live wherever you wish, even if you cannot make it every week to the family dinner. You are no longer dependent on your family or your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. We will provide food, shelter, education, health, welfare and employment. We will provide pensions, insurance and protection.’ Romantic literature often presents the individual as somebody caught in a struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth. The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the individual can survive only thanks to them.”How often do we hear the term “stand on your own two feet?” Or “pull yourself up by your own bootstraps?” Looking for help from others in current culture is seen as a sign of weakness. Standing as individuals has made us weaker, not stronger. We are accused of a form of co-dependency if we are too attached to our extended family or our friends. I’d never really thought about how being individualistic was actually helping the powers-that-be to exert more control us. We are experiencing a great divide in politics, and many of my friends have already decided they won’t be going home for the holidays. We used to be able to set disagreements aside and focus on what we do agree on, like...baseball or reading books or the weather, but now politics has become such a defining part of our lives that we feel like those who disagree with us are actually immoral. Have all these technological advances made us happier? To a degree yes, but also very unhappy in other aspects. The demands on our attention are more immediate and all consuming. Even when we relax, we are not really relaxed. Faster and more efficient doesn’t necessarily equate to making anyone, but the people making the enormous amounts of money at the top, any happier. ”Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between us and the Garden of Eden.”I made 62 highlights reading this book, which is an all-time record for me. I could have had even more! Harari gave me so much to ponder and consider that I’ve already decided that in a few years I’m going to reread the book. I borrowed the book from the library, but I already know I will need to own this one because a book like this needs to be readily available to help me better explain my own thoughts. I could have written a review as long as the book itself because there are so many assertions in this book that cause the mind to expand and make new connections across a myriad of subject matters. It is the most important book I’ve read in a long time. I hope it will be for many of you as well. We are gods on this planet, and we need to change our view of how we see ourselves in the context of the planet and the future. ”Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?”If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten!121!العاقل:تاريخ مختصر للجنس البشري ..الكتاب الذي ترجم لأكثر من ٤٥ لغة منذ صدوره عام ٢٠١١ وبيع منه أكثر من مليون نسخة و هو من تأليف المؤرخ الإسرائيلي و الأستاذ الجامعي يوفال هراري..يُقال عن الكتاب إنه سيغير نظرتك إلي العالم وينصح بيل غيتس بقراءته لكل من هو مهتم بمعرفة تاريخ جنسنا البشري ومستقبله...الكتاب بيبدأ بالثورة الذهنية وبيتكلم كيف إستطاع الإنسان العاقل التخلص من كل الكائنات البشرية الأخري مثل الناتيدرال وغيرهم وكيف كان السبب في إنقراض الكثير من الحيوانات والكاتب وصف الإنسان علي إنه قاتل بيئي متمرس..بياخدنا الكتاب بعد كدة للثورة الزراعية واختراع الكتابة وكيف تم توحيد البشرية من خلال المال والامبراطوريات والأديان ثم إلي الثورة العلمية وتطور الصناعة و أخيراً في أخر فصل بيتكلم عن ما هي طبيعة السعادة ومستقبل النوع البشري..الكتاب يعتبر كتاب علمي وفلسفي شوية والصراحة يعني أنا بكره الكتب دي..بتزهقني جداً في قرايتها ومع ذلك مقتنعة إني لازم من وقت للتاني أقرأ كتب من هذه النوعية..الجزء الأول في الكتاب كان من أمتع الأجزاء بالنسبة لي خصوصا وجهة نظره عن الثورة الزراعية وإنها كانت أكبر خديعة في التاريخ و أستدل علي ذلك بالعديد من المبررات اللي أقنعتني وجداً كمان..لم تعجبني وجهة نظره في الأديان ولم أقتنع برأيه إن الديانات المتعددة الألهة فيها مميزات عن الديانات التوحيدية!! دة غير إنه مقتنع إن الديانات التوحيدية فيها بشكل أو بأخر تعدد الهة ودة في رأيي كلام فارغ ملوش أي أساس من الصحة..تشبيهه للشيوعية بالديانة كلام غير منطقي ..و أيضاً كون 'معالي الباشا' إسرائيلي فهو تطرق لحروب مثل العراق وايران وحرب الخليج و مجابش سيرة المجازر والإنتهاكات اليومية التي تقوم بها بلده!!الكتاب فيه تكرار شوية ولكن طبعاً هو فيه معلومات علمية كثيرة ..مكتوبة بطريقة ممتعة في بعض الأجزاء وبطريقة مملة في معظم الأجزاء..ترجمة الكتاب كانت ممتازة في رأيي و لكني أشعر إن الكتاب ده أخد حجم أكبر من حجمه بكتير وميستهالش كل هذه الضجة!وأخيراً نتفق أو نختلف مع الكاتب ولكن تظل التساؤلات التي طرحها في نهاية الكتاب مهمة جداً إننا نفكر فيها..بعد كل هذه الإختراعات والأشياء المدهشة التي يستطيع البشر أن يفعلوها هل إحنا فعلاً سعداء؟هل إحنا فعلاً راضيين؟ وأهم سؤال فيهم بقي هل إحنا فعلاً عارفين إحنا عاوزين إيه؟عموماً أنا عن نفسي عارفة..مش عاوزة أقرأ كتب علمية تاني السنة دي..خلصت كدة:)""السعادة تبدأ من الداخل ومفتاح السعادة هو أن تفهم من أنت أو ما أنت...""!121!This is a hugely ambitious book; it takes a very broad approach, condensing huge topics into short chapters in an attempt to provide a basis for the development of our entire species. The parts I found most interesting were regarding ecology and man’s interaction with the ecosystem. Human history is that of ecological disaster. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we fuck up the ecosystem and leave our mark of destruction. This is not a new phenomenon, it’s something Sapiens have always done. When we developed our massive brain, we came up with new and creative ways to dominate and control our environments and these were often destructive and to the detriment of all other forms of life. We learnt to survive. We learnt to thrive. But the price was paid with the extinction of many other species.Harari writes that man is so far removed from his natural self. Despite the modern world he lives in, he still has his innate biological drives and instincts (as governed by our genetic makeup) and when these aren’t fulfilled (which they never could be in a metropolis) man becomes depressed and isolated. It’s because we jumped to the top of the food chain and the ecological system was not given time to adjust and neither was man’s biology. These things normally take a millennium, not a few centuries. We still have the same bodies (and instincts) of our ancient kin and it does not meet the environment we live in. This occurred because of three major revolutions in human history. The first was the cognitive revolution which allowed for the creation of language, effectively setting us above all other forms of life in terms of intelligence. The second was the agricultural revolution, which allowed us to harvest the earth and control it to meet our dietary needs. The third was the scientific revolution, which allowed us to take the first steps in understanding life and the universe and use the discoveries to benefit humankind and industry. Harari narrates all these monumental events with much detail, though because of the nature of the book he does fall into generalisations, but I didn't mind too much. There were also quite a few funny comments to offset it:
“You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.” 
And through this he also raises many questions. What would have happened if the other species of human had survived? Would we be at harmony? What religions, science and art could the other species of human’s developed had they the opportunity to flourish like we did? These are such interesting questions, and ripe material for a science fiction novel exploring such ideas. I’m sure someone has written one about it somewhere. So this was a great read, full of interesting facts and ideas, with the potential to change how you view the human race and its history._________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________!121!The only parts of this book that really grabbed my attention were the chapters on early humankind, and especially the interaction between Homo Sapiens and other Homo species. The rest of it is a very pedestrian and basic journey through some aspects of human history, with the author making a lot of sweeping assertions and tending towards a rather vague and disembodied explanation of things like culture, money, etc. These sort of general explanations might be good for someone new to the study of history, but the reader should beware that they don't get taken in too much by the author's often simplistic and one-sided explanation of these concepts. The unifying theme of it being ""a history of humankind"", focusing on Homo Sapiens as a species, often disappears and it becomes a general plod through whatever aspects of history the author is interested in. More on Homo Sapiens' relations with other species and with nature might have been good.!121!Chris Evans highly recommended this book. When Captain America says so, you listen.It’s been almost three years since I joined Goodreads and this is literally the second non-fiction book I finished reading. The last time I read a non-fiction book was in December 2016, it was an autobiography titled In Order to Live by Yeonmi Park. Anyone who knows my reading taste should know that I don’t read non-fiction, not only I found the majority of them to be boring, the main reason behind why I read is escapism and the best genre to offer me the best escapism experience lies in SFF. I don’t even know how to rate and review this book because it always made me feels awkward to give a rating to a non-fiction work, especially if it’s an autobiography, which luckily this book is not. Please remember that my rating—as always—speaks mostly for my reading enjoyment, not the technicality of the book.

“Nothing captures the biological argument better than the famous New Age slogan: ‘Happiness begins within.’ Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses, powerful positions – none of these will bring you happiness. Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin.” 

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is exactly what the title claimed to be. Harari did a spectacular job in compressing important moments—which are HUGE—of our history into this book. I’ve heard so many incredible things about it but never gotten around to it because I thought I would be bored with it, this book, however, proves to be incredibly enlightening and engaging than I thought it would be. There are way too many topics of discussion to unpack in a single review for me, Harari elaborated on how humanity became the most powerful race, the insane power in collective belief, money, war, advancements of technology, religions, and many more important topics.

“Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.” 

A huge part of why I found this book to be not as factual as I expected. Don’t get me wrong, Harari provided tons of facts and well-researched notes, but the author’s belief and opinion definitely bleeds into the text. This isn’t particularly a problem for me; I found it highly intriguing to read his perspective on humanity and our history. In general, I like to understand why people act or think the way they do about something and Harari explained his reasonings. Obviously, there were some of his opinions that I agree with, some that I don’t. However, I never found the book to be preachy, his combination of knowledge, facts, and opinion made me think about our society these days. Plus, I doubt that this book would’ve been compelling for me to read if it were all pure facts and data.

“How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.” 

I’m sure there are thousands of reviewers more knowledgeable than me that can tell you why this book is incredible. I’ll close this review by saying that if you feel intimidated by this book, I can assure you that Harari’s prose was utterly easy to digest. Sure there were a few topics—like capitalism—that bored me but most of the time I had a fantastic and enlightening time reading this book. Heck, I personally think this book should be available as a must-read book for everyone at school when they’re learning about history. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind made education and information a joy to read. The last pages of the book showed glimpses of Harari’s thoughts about the future of humanity, which I assume is what his book, Homo Deus, will be about and I look forward to reading it, hopefully within this year.

Come on out, don't be shy.- I'm not Shai-- You are. - I'm not. Who told you that?- I just figured it out myself. Oh, there you are. What are you doing curled round that branch?- Waiting for a chance to talk to you, Eve. So tell me, where are you going today?- I'm gathering. See, Adam and me are hunter-gatherers and we take turns. Today he's hunting and I'm gathering. He's going to catch a rabbit, and I'm going to find mushrooms and wild garlic for the delicious rabbit and mushroom casserole we're making for dinner.- It sound exhausting.- It takes about three hours a day. And it's fun. I love it.- I see you already have your mushrooms. So where are you going to gather your garlic?- There's a good place just past that hill. - You know that?- I know every inch of the Garden of Eden like it was the back of my hand.- But tell me, what will you do if you get there and a bear has eaten it? I understand that bears love wild garlic.- They do! They're so naughty. But they're so big and strong and cuddly too, you have to take the whole package. I'll go look somewhere else, I know another good spot.- What if those naughty bears have eaten the garlic there too?- Well, I don't know. - Wouldn't Adam be mad if you got home without any garlic for your favourite dinner?- Of course not. He's crazy about me. I'd just kiss him and he'd forget the whole thing a minute later.- But suppose he was really looking forward to dinner, and he was too hungry to want sex right there and then?- Adam's never that hungry. - But suppose.- Look, I have no idea. What am I supposed to do about it?- Well, you could start a vegetable patch.- What's that?- You take some wild garlic, and all the other things you're especially fond of, and you start growing them in one place. - That won't work. The bears would find out about it and they'd come by one night and eat the lot.- No problem. You make a strong fence around the vegetable patch so they can't get in. - A fence? - You take big logs and drive them into the earth, very close together.- Big enough to keep out bears?- You're starting to get the picture.- And all this trouble just so that I can be sure of having garlic when I need it?- Oh, it's not just garlic! You can grow all sorts of things in your vegetable patch. Wheat for example.- Wheat?- It's a kind of grass. You take the seeds and grind them up and mix them with water and herbs and bake them over a fire. Then you eat it with honey.- I like the honey part, but the rest of it sounds disgusting. Why would anyone want to do that?- Look, it's more efficient. You could grow all your food in your vegetable patch, and then you wouldn't have to spend so much time walking around gathering.- I told you it was just three hours a--- You'd be able to start a larger family. You know how much attention kids need. Wouldn't little Cain and Abel like to have a few baby brothers and sisters?- Well now you mention it, Adam and I have talked about that. But I hate this wheat idea. Burned ground-up seed paste. Yuk.- In fact, bread is quite tasty.- I'm sure it's not good for you just eating seed paste. The Lord Jehovah always tells us to maintain a balanced diet with plenty of fresh greens. Trust me, He knows everything about food and nutrition.- If you tried it, you might find it's better than you think.- And look, if we started this vegetable patch, then we'd need to look after it all the time. We couldn't move around. It's fun being a nomad.- But it wouldn't be so much fun if you had a larger family, would it?- Okay, you have a point there.- See, this vegetable patch is just the start. You think ahead a bit. When Cain and Abel are grown up, they'll start families of their own and move off to the next valley to hunt and gather there. You'll never see your grandchildren. Won't that be sad?- Well, it's true--- You start growing wheat, and there'll be enough for you, and Adam, and Cain and Abel, and all their families too. And you'll be able to play with the grandchildren every day.- But look, if there's, like, fifty of us living in the same place for ages then it'll get filthy. We tried staying put once. Didn't work. After a year, we went back to being nomads.- What's more important, a bit of dirt or seeing your grandchildren?- Uh--- Just think about it unselfishly, Eve. - Okay, okay, I guess the grandchildren. I guess. But look--- Yes?- If we start doing this, then after a while there'll be too many of us for the vegetable patch.- So, some of you will go off and start a new vegetable patch.- But then we'll never see them. We'll be back where we started.- You need to invent some technology, Eve. - What's technology?- You know, things like axes and bow-drills and stuff. But a bit more complicated. You'll be amazed. - I'm not sure it sounds like a good idea. Bow-drills are plenty complicated for me.- Eve, just try it! Don't be so prejudiced. You admitted you were wrong about the vegetable patch.- My head is spinning. Why don't you come back and have dinner with us? See, I found the garlic while we were chatting. I'm sure Adam would love to talk to you. I promise, our rabbit casserole is killer.- What's for dessert?- Dessert?- Eve, there are so many things you need to learn! Here, let me tell you how to make an apple pie...[I also have a serious review of the book here.]!121!קיצור תולדות האנושות = Ḳitsur Toldot ha-Enoshut = Sapiens : A Brief Bistory of Humankind, Yuval Noah HarariSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a book by Yuval Noah Harari first published in Hebrew in Israel in 2011, and in English in 2014. The book surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology. Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology: he sees biology as setting the limits of possibility for human activity, and sees culture as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change. Harari surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens into four major parts:The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BCE, when Sapiens evolved imagination).The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE, the development of agriculture).The unification of humankind (the gradual consolidation of human political organisations towards one global empire).The Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 CE, the emergence of objective science).....تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه جولای سال2019میلادیعنوان: انسان خردمند: تاریخ مختصر بشر؛ نویسنده: یووال نوح حراری (هاراری)؛ مترجم: نیک گرگین؛ تهران، فرهنگ نشر نو؛ چاپ اول تا ششم سال1396؛ در621ص؛ شابک9786008547037؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، فرهنگ نشر نو: آسیم؛ چاپ هفتم و دوازدهم سال1397؛ عنوان دیگر تاریخ مختصر بشر؛ موضوع تمدن و انسان و تاریخ؛ تکنولوزی و تمدن، از نویسندگان اسرائیل - سده21مبرگردان پارسایی این کتاب را پسر کوچم برایم خریده است؛ صد هزار سال پیش، دست‌کم شش گونۀ انسانی بر روی زمین زندگی می‌کردند؛ امروز تنها یکی بر جای مانده استما، انسان‌های خردمند؛ چطور گونۀ ما در نبرد برای سلطه بر دیگران پیروز شد؟ چرا نیاکانِ شکارگر – خوراکجوی ما اقدام به ساختن شهرها و برپایی پادشاهی‌ها کردند؟ چگونه به خدایان و ملت‌ها و حقوق بشر ایمان آوردیم، به پول و کتاب‌ها و قوانین اعتماد کردیم، و خود را برده ی بوروکراسی و مصرف‌ گرایی، و حرص و آز برای خوشبختی ساختیم؟ دنیای ما در هزاره ی آینده چه شکلی به خود خواهد گرفت؟ انسان خردمند به‌ گونه‌ ای جسورانه، همه‌ جانبه و بحث‌ برانگیز هر آنچه را تا کنون گمان می‌کردیم در مورد انسان می‌دانیم: افکارمان، رفتارمان، اعمال‌مان، اقتدارمان…؛ و آینده‌ مان را، به چالش می‌کشد؛ از همگی‌مان با هر ایمان و باوری می‌خواهند که روایتهای زیربنایی جهان را زیر پرسش ببریم، پیشرفت‌های گذشته را با دلمشغولی‌های کنونی مرتبط کنیم، و از نتایج جدل‌ برانگیز آن نهراسیم؛ دکتر «یووال نوح حراری» از دانشگاه «آکسفورد» دکترای تاریخ دارند، و در دانشگاه «بیت‌ المقدس»، تاریخ جهان تدریس می‌کنند؛ موضوع اصلی این پژوهش ایشان پرسشهای صریحی است، همچون رابطۀ تاریخ و زیست‌ شناسی چیست؟ آیا عدالتی در تاریخ یافت می‌شود؟ آیا در مسیر تاریخ مردمان سعادتمندتر شده‌ اند؟ شصت و پنج هزار تن، در دورۀ اینترنتی تدریس تاریخ مختصر بشر ایشان، ثبت‌ نام کرده‌ اندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 25/12/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 06/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!إنَّ وصف المؤلف بأنه « مؤرخ استثنائي » وبأن الكتاب هو « أفضل كتاب ستقرأه في حياتك » هو من قبيل المبالغة الهوليوودية، ومن أسباب نكد العيش، لأنه ينمّ انعدام الحساسية في التلقي أمام كثير من الأفكار الاختزالية والمسطّحة، إن لم نقل الخاطئة، التي جاء الكتاب ملغومًا بها حتى لامَس أحيانًا تخوم الادعاء، منذ بيل غيتس وحتى باراك أوباما. مثال صغير؛ الزَّعم بأن الدين الإسلامي دين لا يدعو للتعلّم بحجة أن النبي لقّب بـ « خاتم الأنبياء »، وعليه فكل ما لم تورده النصوص الإسلامية غير ضروري، ضاربًا بعرض الحائط - أو جاهلًا وهو الأسوأ - مقولته الشهيرة؛ « أنتم أعلم بأمور دنياكم » ومآلاتها في متوالية من الفتوحات العلمية التي جرت طوال القرون الست للحضارة الإسلامية. الحقيقة أن الفصول التي أفردها هاراري عن الدور الذي لعبه الدين في تاريخ الإنسان يشبه وجبة بائتة ورديئة بالمقارنة مع ما يمكن أن تقرأه مع فراس السواح وخزعل الماجدي مثلًا. كما أنه همَّش إلى حد بعيد الدور الذي لعبه علم النفس وعلم الدماغ في عملية تطور المجتمعات وتحضرها.التحفظ الآخر كان القول بأن كل ما هو موجود وقابل للحدوث فهو طبيعي، وعليه تحييد دور الثقافة في المفاضلة بين فكرة وأخرى، بين قيمة وأخرى، إلى درجة الوصول إلى حالة من النسبية المطلقة التي لا تقل كسلًا عن الثنائية المريحة. إن استخدام الطبيعة كمرجع وحيد لتقييم مواقفنا يعني القبول حتى بفكرة القتل لأنه طبيعي وممكن. ونعم، الثقافات هي ابنة الإنسان، ومع ذلك ما زال بالإمكان المفاضلة بين ثقافة وأخرى، لكنَّ ربما يفضل بعضنا ألا يفعل ذلك، فالأمر هكذا أسهل.لقد ناقض المؤلف حتى تعريفه الخاص للدين بالقول بأنه يدعي أنه آت من مصدر فوق بشري، عندما وصم الشيوعية بأنها دين وأن إلهه هو ماركس. لقد منح نفسه حق المبالغة في التأويل أحيانًا، وشعرت كثيرًا بأن ثمة قسر وإصرار على تفسير الأمور بطريقة تبسيطية واحدة.!121!Mi-a plăcut mai puțin decît Homo Deus. Sapiens: Scurtă istorie... e considerată una dintre cele mai influente cărți din secolul XXI, e în Top ten. Nu mi-am explicat prea bine de ce. Poate pentru că recomandă (și pe drept cuvînt) o dietă vegetariană. Și eu sînt un semi-vegetarian. Am citit nu de mult o recenzie care a reținut doar acest aspect al cărții, că e bine să mîncăm numai pătrunjel, mărar, coacăze. Prin urmare, Sapiens... e și un manifest ecologist. În treacăt fie spus, capitolul despre creșterea animalelor pentru hrană e sfîșietor.Prima parte a cărții prezintă ipoteze imposibil de verificat. La ce visa oare vînătorul-culegător, în ce divinități credea? Nu vom ști niciodată. A doua parte e plină de profeții sumbre. Cît de etic e să-l transformi pe Sapiens într-un robot extrem de isteț? Cît de etic e să-l modifici într-o ființă nemuritoare?Pentru Yuval Noah Harari, istoria e un drum de la bine la rău, de la vîrsta de aur, a lui Saturn, la vîrsta de fier. Acum trăim în cea mai neagră dintre epoci. Îi dau dreptate. Omul e pe cale să-și piardă mințile. Cînd era vînător-culegător, omul știa mult mai puține lucruri (sfera cunoașterii era mult mai restrînsă), dar mai bine, mai complet. Acum știe infinit mai multe, dar nu mai poate stăpîni întregul: „Știe din toate cîte nimic”. Nimeni nu-l poate stăpîni. Omul e un ucenic-vrăjitor ebrietat.Să nu uit. Inteligența nu depinde deloc de mulțimea cunoștințelor acumulate. Aristotel știa mult mai puține lucruri decît orice individ școlit de azi, dar gîndea mult mai riguros decît noi. De la Platon încoace, inteligența noastră nu a progresat nici cu un milimetru. Din acest motiv cuvios, a citi (a înțelege) dialogul Parmenide e o ispravă tot mai rară. Pricepem foarte puțin, o pojghiță, și întotdeauna greșit. Am devenit mult mai ușor de înșelat. Ne autoamăgim. Trăim din iluziile învățate de la bunici și profesori. Ne hrănim mintea cu prejudecăți.Revoluția cognitivă (acum 50 de mii de ani) a fost cum a fost, deși nu știm ce a provocat-o: un hazard, să zicem. Omul a început să picteze, să scrie poeme, să se gîndească la viața de apoi. A inventat o ființă divină, summum ens. În schimb, revoluția agricolă (acum 12 mii de ani) - afirmă Yuval Noah Harari - a reprezentat un dezastru, o nenorocire. Omul a crezut că rezolvă o problemă (aceea a hranei) și a deschis în realitate „cutia Pandorei”. A întemeiat așezări mizere, populate de copii flămînzi, așezări bîntuite de maladii necruțătoare, ciumă, holeră, viruși etc.Într-un cuvînt, Sapiens e pe ducă, a ajuns la crepuscul. Nu mai ține minte aproape nimic, fiindcă își depozitează știința în cărți și nu-și mai exersează memoria. Nu mai poate recita un vers măcar. Grecii știau Odiseea pe de rost. Nu e fericit. Harari crede că numai vînătorul-culegător era fericit. Capacitatea craniană i-a scăzut, creierul i se ramolește. Vînătorii-culegători aveau un craniu mai mare, chiar dacă nu la fel de mare ca al neanderthalienilor, iar creierul adăpostit înăuntru chiar le folosea la ceva, nu-l țineau degeaba. De prin anii 70 ai secolului trecut, IQ-ul lui Sapiens e într-o prăbușire vertiginoasă. Putem observa asta cu ochiul liber, nu-i nevoie de teste psihologice complicate, care oricum nu spun mare lucru.Ce va fi? Să treacă epidemia și dacă nu vom muri, vom vedea...!121!Rating 5* out of 5. This is one of those rare books which is superbly written, intelligent and mind-altering. I am convinced by this author's arguments and my view of the human condition has changed permanently. I thought this would be a book that would delve lavishly in later human evolution, but it is does not. It discusses it briefly and moves on, concentrating its effort on the times of agricultural revolution and forward. It is a masterpiece of anthropology. ""Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. One the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As times went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as United States and Google.""""Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persits, the imagined reality exerts force in the world. [...] Most millionaires sincerely believe in the existence of money and limited liability of companies. Most human-rights activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights.""I have never considered the extent of the imagined reality we all live in before. I have never equated my belief in human rights with the belief in Vishnu, or considered that a corporation too is all in our collective heads. The author moves on through history and gives plenty of new perspectives on events. ""Most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on the condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions - and buy more and more. This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we'll get paradise in return? We've seen it on television.""These are just a few tidbits of insight and perspective. I absolutely loved this book! Highly recommended to anyone curious about the human condition.!121!Początek bardzo mnie wciągnął, ale im dalej tym mniej konkretnie. Niemniej jest to świetna książka!!121!""Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?"" Now, that is a mean cliffhanger on page 466! I am so done with Sapiens, I am willing to enter the realm of posthuman Homo Deus out of spite for my species. During the time it took me to read the ""short"" history of humankind, written in funny sarcastic prose, painting with broad brush strokes what made us develop into this bizarre population of 7 billion people, I have rated this brick of a book five stars, one star, no star, all the fault in our stars. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, though. I am as surprised as I can be that my fingers eventually ended up choosing four of them to head my review. It must mean that my serotonin levels are particularly high today.Let's be honest. There are difficulties in this book. And there's no surprise there, as it is written by a homo sapiens, a species notoriously wellknown for making false assumptions and creating individual and collective fictions to survive, adapt and conquer the world. The author, who specialises in world history according to the oxymoronic blurb (what is his GENERAL field then, I would like to ask?), sells his narrative as a factual account a bit too often for me to enjoy it fully. I felt myself tending towards one star while reading the superficial analysis of empires, for example. I kept asking myself what the preferred audience for this book is, as it is clearly too difficult to read for people who are not interested in history, and too shallow for those who are. I was building up a real emotional rage (my serotonin levels were bad between pages 200-350!).BUT!This books keeps people in my environment talking, discussing, reflecting. And that is a good thing, I believe. As long as homo sapiens tries to acquire more sapientia, the world becomes more serene according to my worldview, aka imagination. I like Harari's premise, that the ability to create collective fictions and use them as guidelines for our shared communities defines us as a species.And part of my irritation derived from the fact that he is excellent at demonstrating the human narrative skill in his book. I felt his story took over, and interferred with mine. I have a different idea of the Agricultural Revolution. So I can get into a rage when reading his? I am confirming his premise by doing so.My annoyance with his easygoing, dismissive style is at the same time what kept me reading - he is like the laughing philosopher who despairs of the world and decides that all is a joke, while I most of the time take the position of the crying philosopher who wants to change humankind for the better. Harari does for homo sapiens what Hitchens did for gods. He puts them in their place. This book has its place in the meaningless, yet amusing narrative of a bunch of mammals whose best and worst skill is storytelling.Be warned, but read it!!121!This is an excellent book about the history of humans, covering all aspects; evolution, anthropology, geography, psychology, religion, ideologies, and the future of humans. Physically, the book is beautiful; the glossy paper makes it heavy as well. What really makes the book interesting is the unique points of view that the author, Yuval Harari, brings to life.For example, early in the book, Harari mentions that chimps and sapiens (humans) can only organize in groups of up to 150, without organizing into a hierarchical structure. So, how did cities grow to their enormous size? Through fiction. Yes, that's right, through fiction, through beliefs in common myths. These are myths about ideologies. These imaginary fictions include human rights, nations, and currency; they work because many people cooperatively believe in them.Some civilizations are built quite differently from our own. For example, the Bari Indians believe that genes do not come from a single pair of parents, but that they are contributed by multiple fathers. Monogamous relationships do not exist among their tribes. Harari discusses a number of controversial theories about nuclear families and monogamous relationships. One theory states that infidelities and divorce of modern times stem from forcing people to live in unnatural, permanent relationships. Another theory holds that monogamy and nuclear families are core human behaviors.Harari describes the disappearance of many animal species in certain habitats that are coincidental in time with the arrival of humans. For example, Australia lost 23 of 24 large animal species at about the same time that humans migrated there. Many other islands were also rich in large mammals until humans arrived.Harari discusses the agricultural revolution in some detail. He addresses the question why agriculture became important in the Middle East, Central America, and China, but did not become popular in Australia, Alaska, or South Africa. He explains that most plants and animals cannot be domesticated, and that regions where there is a deficit in domesticatable plants and animals did not develop agriculture.It is obvious that Harari laments the rise of agriculture. He claims that hunter gatherers, who roamed the lands and did not stick to one location like agriculturists, were more stimulated, less in danger of starvation and disease. Their diets were more varied. Agriculture increased the volume of food, but not better quality of food, and did not yield more leisure-time. Agriculture created population explosions and pampered elites. In fact, Harari claims that the agricultural revolution is ""history's biggest fraud."" The culprits of this fraud were wheat, rice, and potatoes, all plants that domesticated humans! Also, farming encouraged warfare, because it forced people to fight to protect territory. And agriculture, because it developed over millennia (not overnight), created consequences gradually. People could not anticipate the full consequences of their decisions. More wheat helped to lead to more children, and less food for each.Harari compares the Code of Hammurabi with the American Declaration of Independence. Hammurabi's code implicitly acknowledges three classes; superiors, commoners, and slaves. The Declaration of Independence states that all men were created equally. But Harari disputes this; he states that men were not created at all, but instead they evolved differently.From a sociological point of view, Harari asks why are most cities patriarchical. It is not because men are stronger. Physical prowess is inversely proportional to social power in most societies. He explores various theories, but none of them are very compelling.Since the French Revolution, political history is a series of attempts to reconcile liberty--which involves individual freedom--and equality. In order to understand another culture, one should look at the ""Catch 22's"", that is, look where rules and standards contradict each other. These contradictions are part of culture. For example, in Medieval Europe, there was a clash between Christianity and chivalry. In modern Western civilization, there are clashes between equality and liberty.I have just scratched the surface of this big book. I will leave you with one more unique point of view expressed in this book. Harari calls the present modern age the ""Age of Ignorance."" I won't explain this; it would be a spoiler. This book is a wonderful introduction to sociology, and I highly recommend it to all.!121!مثل شطرنج‌بازی که در تلاش برای شکست (یا پیروزی بر) خودش ناکام می‌ماند، نویسنده‌ی این کتاب نیز سعی بر آن داشته است که نظریات متضاد و متناقض درباره‌ی تاریخ انسان را با نوعی بی‌طرفی و بدون جانب‌داری به مخاطب ارائه دهد. هرچند که در این راه، گاهی از مسیر بی‌طرفی خارج شده و در کسوت یک نطریه‌پرداز، دست به تحلیل وقایع می‌زند. از این که بگذریم، انسان خردمند، کتاب خوش‌خوانی است که بررسی روند تکامل انسان از آغاز تا عصر کنونی می‌پردازد. گاهی به تحلیل تاریخی می‌پردازد و گاهی به بیان وقایع و ذکر اطلاعات بسنده می‌کند. گاهی همراه با ایده‌ی پیشرفت و گاهی بر ضد آن سخن می‌گوید. در مجموع، اثری خواندنی، لذت‌بخش و روان است.!121!In this book, professor Harari crammed EVERYTHING. Or, to be precise, a bit of everything with astounding randomness. The book's initial chapters are its strongest feature. They also mislead you into thinking that the book is going in a certain direction (anthropology and evolution), while the direction that it actually takes is a completely different one. Too bad.I found the brief portion about history in relation to happiness interesting, or at least original, because I had never heard that perspective before. Like all sociological and philosophical writers, however, Harari wants to sound completely detached from his object of study but fails miserably, and like many others who write on such broad topics, he ends up serving up his personal views and opinions as if they were perfectly objective assessments. Example: he is steeped in women's rights as if they were part of an ""objectively"" right ""imagined order"". Or in the portion about sexuality, where ""open mindness"" is presented as the non-refutable objectively best approach to sex. In other words: every type of mental order is ""imagined"" (he really means ""deluded"") except for his own , which can be summed up in scientism and liberalism.Among other ""imagined realities that are not imagined because imagined by the author"" , Harari keeps banging on the necessity for the global unification of humankind. I also love the concept, but so did John Lennon (not a great realist) and so does a 10 y.o. who knows nothing about history. ""Imagine all the people sharing all the world"" is not a sound foreign policy. He says that the great unifiers of mankind are 1) money 2) empires 3) religion. In this order. And that they are all imagined. Politheists are intrinsically open-minded, therefore cool guys, because they never wanted to convert anyone. In line with the relativist zeitgeist of our era, he keeps using the word ""open minded"" as an objectively positive quality for people. Time to remind Harari of the great Chesterton line: “Do not be so open-minded that your brains fall out!”. The last chapters present futuristic scenarios that SF readers have been very familiar with since the '50s - but for Harari, they are excitingly fresh and original. He seems to be unaware of the non-originality of these scenarios, and shows his abyssal ignorance in the SF field in more than one occasion. For example, when he says ""science fiction describes developments of our present society, only with more advanced technologies"", which is probably less than 50% of SF literature. Also ""Nobody foresaw the internet"" (!) Wow. Just wow. That's an ""F-"" in Science Fiction class, professor Harari. Religion. Throughout the book, Harari doesn't demonstrate a real understanding of religion, aside from the formal and technical aspects of it. For example, in line with western mainstream pop thinking, to him Buddhism is the most interesting of all religions, because ""it's the one focusing the most on happiness"". God, what a horribly superficial and conventional and stereotypical statement! He goes on to idealize Buddhism, which ""gives profound serenity by stopping the pursuit of feelings"". I don't need to add anything here for anyone who has a fair knowledge of Christianity or Judaism or Islam. Clearly, he doesn't. I could go on for hours and highlight every instance where Harari presents totally subjective and arguable points as if they were not, but l won’t. Instead, I will briefly point out the  worst thing about this book : that is, how the author spent his time trying to destroy ideas and ""imagined things"", illusions, while making zero efforts to be constructive. Here is the thing: among educated people, today, stripping sense and meaning out of anything is the easiest thing to do. Just ask ANY teenager. What is really difficult, on the other hand, is to BUILD. To believe. To develop. To create hope. All things that this book does not do for one second,  ... although it could have done, and without breaking out of the endless boundaries that it gave itself (“to talk about everything”). The very last sentence of the book perfectly sums up this pessimistic point of view: ""Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods (human beings) who don't know what they want? "". So to sum up, a weird, pessimistic, sometimes engaging, but fundamentally flawed and overhyped book.!121!Fantastic. Absolutely sublime. I don't think I've ever read a book with such grand scope, or a book that promises to cover so much and actually delivers. Dealing with the biggest questions about our species - Why are we here? Why are we the way we are? What does our happiness mean? - Harari writes precisely and with shrewd use of metaphor, providing answers that seem intuitively right but leading us to think further than we have before. The links between giant forces that control our world such as capitalism, science, and empire are made brilliantly and made me see the world through fresh eyes.Dizzyingly good. Everyone should read this.!121!A friend of mine at work recommended I read this during the week – and it is hard not being struck by the odd coincidence of that. Not so much him recommending a book to me, he’s done that before, but this book is very similar to The Patterning Instinct and I only read that a week or so ago. And that’s odd too, since it is years since I’ve read a book on this theme, despite it being a bit of a favourite at one time. So, reading two books on much the same topic, covering lots and lots of the same ground, and in quick succession, recommended by completely different sources all seems strange to me.If you are tossing up whether or not to read this one, I would probably recommend reading The Patterning Instinct instead. Not least because, I think it covers the non-Western philosophies and spiritual traditions it discusses much more on their own terms than this one does. It also covers them in ways that make you feel, even though the Patterning’s author provided merely a thumbnail sketch of each, that it is a sketch of the philosophy itself. This one made me feel I was being presented an ‘example’ rather than a ‘sketch’ – with the history of humans being presented much more as a kind of story that leads to us in the West as the culmination. That is, I came away from tins one thinking of Said’s Orientalism, feeling that this was a white guy explaining other-people’s-cultures – which might even have been true of the patterning book too, but that one felt more inclusive. I want to say ‘objective’ but that’s probably not the right word.The patterning book was, even in its title, a bit of a dig at Pinker – whereas, this one pays him homage repeatedly throughout. And that is interesting here, since we are seeing essentially the same ‘data’ being used to justify significantly different conclusions in the two books. So, in that sense, I really didn’t come away from reading these two books in quick succession feeling it was a waste of time. I do understand that you might not want to read both of them together – although, I feel like I’ve read them in the way that an ex-Australian Prime Minister used to collect various conductors’ interpretations of Mahler Symphonies. The benefit of reading both has been that I got to see ‘evidence’ from the past, even when it is pretty much the exact same evidence, being used to justify significantly different conclusions. Obviously enough, I would recommend the Patterning book because it more closely corresponds with my prejudices – something that would be hardly surprising, I guess. But that said, I would also recommend it because I think it presents the material in more depth and in ways that are likely to provide you (and maybe even provoke you) with more insight into the complexities of the material too. The author of that one remains clear and accessible, despite the complexities of the material presented – something this one is too, by the way, it just I didn’t quite feel this one was as comprehensive – so the clarity here was also a function of the simpler presentation of the material.I found a lot of the last of this to be – well, a bit too Pinker for my tastes as well. This happened a couple of times throughout – for instance, there is a bit early on where he discusses males and aggression and their hormones and the genetic selection that encouraged it, and so on – and since I have just finished reading Fine’s T-Rex book on all this, that section proved a bit of a cringe. The bits at the end where science is proposed as being about to swoop down and save the day (and look, I know I’ve making a bit of a strawman of his argument here, but too not much of a strawman) left me cold, to be honest. My problem with the promise that ‘human ingenuity will triumph in the end’ is that, well, maybe it will, but betting the house on something that simply can’t be a sure thing seems a little reckless to me. Particularly when all life on earth might be wagered on the other side of the bet. I’m not much of a betting man, so perhaps I’m too cautious. But then, maybe we should be a little more cautious with this kind of gamble, even if we end up laughing at how overly cautious proved to be while we are looking back from the glorious future that is always promised us. It’s just that some scientists believe that if global warming proves to be as bad as they think it is going to be, the total population of people on the planet could end up being about half a billion people – which means that about 7 billion people will be in excess to requirements and so will have to die one way or another.Bits of this were really very good – I’m definitely not saying ‘don’t read this book under any circumstances’ – not in the least, but if you’ve read neither of these two books and only plan to read one – read the other one.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology']"
Educated (Hardcover),Tara Westover,4.47,1505511,2018,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.","On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.
Educated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho. Tara Westover - image from her The Times
We had a farm which belonged to my grandfather, and we had a salvage yard full of crumpled-up cars which belonged to my father. And my mother was a - she was an herbalist and a midwife. And as children, we spent a lot of hours walking on the mountain, gathering rose hips and mullein flowers that she could stew into tinctures. So in a lot of ways, it was a very beautiful childhood. - from NPR interview The children constituted his workforce in Gene’s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place.
…he just didn't have that bone in his head that said, this is dangerous; don't do this. And he had a really hard time understanding injuries even after they had happened and how severe they were. I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father’s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one’s ills, calling her products “god’s pharmacy.” And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover’s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom’s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.
…there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother’s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun’s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara’s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family’s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?
All abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you’re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you’re doing isn’t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as “Shawn” in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara’s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, “Yer a wizard, Harry.”When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she’d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss.

From a GR interview with Westover
Goodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I’m really, really excited about it. It’s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, ""Oh, you wrote a good book,"" but it does mean something extra when it’s readers, when it’s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it’s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it. That means something a little bit different and a little bit extra. A readers’ award is a really exciting one.

Whenever I don’t know a lot about something, I’ll read a textbook or watch an online course until I do.I thought I was pretty good at teaching myself—until I read Tara Westover’s memoir Educated. Her ability to learn on her own blows mine right out of the water. I was thrilled to sit down with her recently to talk about the book.Tara was raised in a Mormon survivalist home in rural Idaho. Her dad had very non-mainstream views about the government. He believed doomsday was coming, and that the family should interact with the health and education systems as little as possible. As a result, she didn’t step foot in a classroom until she was 17, and major medical crises went untreated (her mother suffered a brain injury in a car accident and never fully recovered).Because Tara and her six siblings worked at their father’s junkyard from a young age, none of them received any kind of proper homeschooling. She had to teach herself algebra and trigonometry and self-studied for the ACT, which she did well enough on to gain admission to Brigham Young University. Eventually, she earned her doctorate in intellectual history from Cambridge University. (Full disclosure: she was a Gates Scholar, which I didn’t even know until I reached that part of the book.)Educated is an amazing story, and I get why it’s spent so much time on the top of the New York Times bestseller list. It reminded me in some ways of the Netflix documentary 
Wild, Wild Country
, which I recently watched. Both explore people who remove themselves from society because they have these beliefs and knowledge that they think make them more enlightened. Their belief systems benefit from their separateness, and you’re forced to be either in or out.But unlike Wild, Wild Country—which revels in the strangeness of its subjects—Educated doesn’t feel voyeuristic. Tara is never cruel, even when she’s writing about some of her father’s most fringe beliefs. It’s clear that her whole family, including her mom and dad, is energetic and talented. Whatever their ideas are, they pursue them.Of the seven Westover siblings, three of them—including Tara—left home, and all three have earned Ph.D.s. Three doctorates in one family would be remarkable even for a more “conventional” household. I think there must’ve been something about their childhood that gave them a degree of toughness and helped them persevere. Her dad taught the kids that they could teach themselves anything, and Tara’s success is a testament to that.I found it fascinating how it took studying philosophy and history in school for Tara to trust her own perception of the world. Because she never went to school, her worldview was entirely shaped by her dad. He believed in conspiracy theories, and so she did, too. It wasn’t until she went to BYU that she realized there were other perspectives on things her dad had presented as fact. For example, she had never heard of the Holocaust until her art history professor mentioned it. She had to research the subject to form her own opinion that was separate from her dad’s.Her experience is an extreme version of something everyone goes through with their parents. At some point in your childhood, you go from thinking they know everything to seeing them as adults with limitations. I’m sad that Tara is estranged from a lot of her family because of this process, but the path she’s taken and the life she’s built for herself are truly inspiring.When you meet her, you don’t have any impression of all the turmoil she’s gone through. She’s so articulate about the traumas of her childhood, including the physical abuse she suffered at the hands of one brother. I was impressed by how she talks so candidly about how naïve she once was—most of us find it difficult to talk about our own ignorance.I was especially interested to hear her take on polarization in America. Although it’s not a political book, Educated touches on a number of the divides in our country: red states versus blue states, rural versus urban, college-educated versus not. Since she’s spent her whole life moving between these worlds, I asked Tara what she thought. She told me she was disappointed in what she called the “breaking of charity”—an idea that comes from the Salem witch trials and refers to the moment when two members of the same group break apart and become different tribes.“I worry that education is becoming a stick that some people use to beat other people into submission or becoming something that people feel arrogant about,” she said. “I think education is really just a process of self-discovery—of developing a sense of self and what you think. I think of [it] as this great mechanism of connecting and equalizing.”Tara’s process of self-discovery is beautifully captured in Educated. It’s the kind of book that I think everyone will enjoy, no matter what genre you usually pick up. She’s a talented writer, and I suspect this book isn’t the last we’ll hear from her. I can’t wait to see what she does next.!121!""It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you""I am in the minority on this one, but this did not blow me away. I wanted to read this after seeing so many high ratings. I was expecting to love this book but ended up feeling meh about it. I actually wanted to hurry the book up in parts and other times found it to be a little repetitive. There were other times I wanted her to go into more detail or explain things more. One thing I had an issue with is that her family is described as survivalists who educated their children at home - many of which do not even have a birth certificate - but then they had many modern conveniences. Her father has a junkyard and a huge distrust of the government. Her Mother becomes a midwife at her husband's urging and makes tinctures and uses herbs to cure those in her family and in their community. I do realize that the family acquired the telephone due to her Mother's job as a mid-wife but then I wondered how they paid for everything. .Tara grows up free or wild. She didn’t bathe that often, didn’t wash her hands after using the restroom, and is unaware of world history, and is quite comfortable living around bad odors and smells. She is abused by an older brother and no one seems to notice, intervene, or even care. They seem to be a reckless group - example: multiple car accidents, etc. I had a hard time believing some of the information presented. Case in point the first car accident in the book, Tara's father offered to pay for the damaged tractor. Where did they get the money? Just how much does farm equipment cost? It's not cheap, I know that. Even if the farm equipment purchased is used it still must be pricey. Plus, the damage to their car would mean they would need to purchase another. Then the family has another car accident. More money, lots of injuries, possible need for another vehicle, etc. I am not saying that none of this happened, but I had a lot of questions about how things were paid forPlus, this family seemed to be very accident prone, falling from surfaces, fires, head injuries. Was this because they were raised without any rules and became reckless, or did bad things just happen to them?Tara does want a better life for herself. She does educate herself at home, so she can pass the test to get into College. College isn't cheap, nor are book, nor is housing or food. Again, I wondered how she paid for all of this. Plus, once she got to college, she didn't seem to mind that her roommates were upset with the smell in their home. Dirty dishes, not bathing, not having clean clothes. I get if this is the norm, in the home she grew up in but when faced with other's displeasure, I would think a smart girl like her would have taken the hint that being clean and living in a clean environment is the norm, not how she was raised. Plus, at home a young man even pointed out to her that her home smelled as did she.There was a part of this book that I did enjoy. Tara's thirst for knowledge and teaching herself and gaining entrance to college without a formal education. I appreciated her struggles and having to learn how to ""learn"". She went on to achieve a lot in her life and it is impressive and commendable. Tara definitely was an under dog and I did root for her. She definitely changed her life and sought for better for herself. Even without a lot of support from her family, she found strength and kept going. This is what shined for me in this book with otherwise left me with questions. Who doesn't want to root for her? I did. Having said that, there were just too many questions raised why reading this. I don't care if someone is a survivalist, I would think one would still want their children to be safe and free of harm. The turning the blind eye to abuse was despicable. The family also had a lot of modern conveniences which did not gel with my idea of what a survivalist family would own or not own. But I am no expert on survivalist families. Her father clearly had some mental health issues and they contributed to his beliefs and possibly to their way of life. Yes, she suffered abuse. Yes, she grew up in a home with an untreated mentally ill parent, yes, it is all very sad but it was still not enough to make me enjoy the book. What worked for me in this book was Tara's drive for a better life. How with very little support from her family, she went out on her own and obtained an education. I appreciated her drive and determination. Her book is well written and I realize this is her account of how she remembers things from her perspective. I just was left with questions hence the 3 star rating.Again, in the minority with this one. Most love this book. It just wasn't for me.I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing group and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com!121!Excellent memoir. Really well written. The story is just horrifying from beginning to end. It really makes you wonder how many people are homeschooling their kids and enabling abuse and indoctrinating kids in all kinds of racist paranoid nonsense. I kept thinking “this is so fucked up” as the story careened from one nightmarish circumstance to the next. It’s amazing what people are able to survive. It’s a shame that survival is demanded of so many.!121!2 stars and I know, I am an outlier.I have been born with a gene called the ""doubting Thomas"" gene. It has made me very leery of trusting and believing a lot of things and unfortunately this gene kicked in big time in this story billed as a memoir.While I do believe that the things described by Tara Westover might have happened, I also have to think that this was a book of childhood memories. Sometimes, as children, we distort the truth, and sometimes grown to adulthood we only remember fragments of what happened and when confronted by others realize our memory was somewhat faulty.There are actually quite a few things I just could not wrap my hands around in this story. For one, being a former teacher and having had the pleasure of teaching many gifted and brilliant students, I just could not see what, with the quantum lapses in Tara's education, how she could possibly have made it into both a fairly prestigious college and then onto the highest level of university in England. Learning builds upon itself and being a former math teacher, I can say that if one only had the rudimentary knowledge of the four simple math functions, that going onto higher level math would be virtually impossible. Was it possible that her early education being home schooled was not as lacking as she described it to be?The next issue I had was that of the number of injuries incurred by she and her brothers and her mother just snapping her fingers, using essential oils and other agents and then recovery occurred. Granted, I am not a medical professional, but the incidents described in one or two particular cases was life threatening and yet these techniques done by the mother worked? I know I still blame it on my doubting Thomas gene. I do also have a belief in both holistic and regular medicine being a partnership in the healing process.Next up for me, was Tara's ability to obtain somehow the finances to attend college and then to travel overseas to England and back. Yes, I do know that she was awarded scholarships but what about the incidentals, travel, food not provided in school. Did she live like a hermit and never leave the confines of the school she was attending? From her writing, we know that is not true.Lastly, if indeed these things were happening, where were the people who should have noticed the abuse? Where were the friends, the church goers, the people who did business with the father? Would they have not noticed untoward things happening to the Westover children. Would not at least one of them have come forward? Why are some of them coming forward now to defend this family?So, sorry to say, I am going against the grain of many of my fellow much respected readers and reviewers, and saying that I just could not buy into what was being set forward in this book. I am not an advocate for her parents, nor do I think that things never did happen. Perhaps to me, this book just has not explained the circumstances well enough for the doubting Thomas in me to believe. Thankful to my Traveling Sisters who read this book along with me. We all seemed to share the same ideas on this one and I am glad as always to have my thoughts and feeling able to be expressed to such a wonderful group of avid readers. Also thank you to netgalley, the author and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this book.!121!Difficult to read. Impossible to put down. A powerful, powerful book that you shouldn’t miss. I can’t just leave it at that because Tara Westover’s story deserves more than those few words. I don’t often read memoirs, but when I do I want them to be told by extraordinary people who have a meaningful story to tell and that would be faint praise for this book. It sounds odd to say how beautifully written this is because we are not spared of the ugly details of what this family was about, but yet it is beautifully written. I had to remind myself at times that I wasn’t reading a gritty novel, that Tara and her family were real as I got more than just a glimpse of a life that was hard for me to even imagine. A religious fanatic father, hoarding food and guns and bullets and keeping his family off the radar, not filing for birth certificates, not getting medical attention when they needed it, avoiding the government, the feds at all cost , keeping his children out of school, the paranoia, the preparation for the “Days of Abomination” - this is what we find in this place on a mountain in Idaho. There are horrible accidents and he won’t get medical help for his family. Her mother’s healing herbs and tinctures are used to treat the slightest scrape to the most horrible head injury or burns from gasoline to an explosion. If some thing bad happens it because that’s the will of the Lord. Her mother seems at times more sympathetic to her children, but she is complicit by her subservience to her husband. I don’t even know how to describe it other than gut wrenching to see the effects on this family of neglect in the name of religious beliefs and in reality mental illness. It isn’t just her father but the brutality by one of her brother’s which is more than awful and creates rifts between family members,  That she was bold enough and somehow found the will to rise above it all while she is torn with the sense of duty, of loyalty to her family, the ingrained beliefs, still loving her family is miraculous. Going to college was the first time she’d been in a classroom, not knowing what the Holocaust was, learning about slavery, the depression, WWII, the civil rights movement. She doesn’t just get a college education but ultimately a PhD from Cambridge, a Harvard fellowship. She struggles for years to discover who she was, who she could be - a scholar, a writer, an independent woman. This is a stunning, awe inspiring story that will haunt the reader long after the book ends. Thank you to Tara Westover for sharing yourself with us. I received an advanced copy of this book from Random House through NetGalley. Thanks to my friend Diane for bringing this book to my attention. Without her review I might have missed this.!121!Westover is clearly a decent writer, but I felt underwhelmed by this book. Some things didn't seem to add up. Such as how an uneducated mountain wildgirl clicked her heels together, magicked up thousands of dollars (yeah, yeah, scholarships don't cover everything, you know), and went on to some of the world's most prestigious higher education centres. Intelligence is not the main thing required to attend Harvard or Cambridge; being able to pass exams and perform the system's dance is. Someone without formal education should have no idea how to do that.Also-- are some people magically cured by herbs and finger-clicking here or did I miss some medical intervention along the way?But I think, overall, I was just a little disappointed because everyone seemed to find the survivalist aspect so dramatic and awful. I've read a few books about isolated communities that go off the grid and enforce their own laws and, I have to say, Westover's experience felt pretty tame. Her family were survivalists who spent months canning peaches and hunting for scrap, but is this really that odd? I heard all these promises of ""wilderness"" and ""mountain survivalists"", but they have a phone and TV. I would say this family is more ""eccentric"" than ""survivalist"".Where the book does succeed is as a portrait of physical and emotional abuse. I think this was the most important part of the book and it's been glossed over in favour of people's delight at learning about weirdos running around wild in the mountains. (I'm not judging; I came for that too.) I also found it really interesting and sad when the author suggested that her father's paranoid delusions might have been undiagnosed bipolar disorder. It's a quick read with crowd-pleasing writing, I'll give it that. But it's hard to not feel like something is amiss, and certain events were probably exaggerated. Or, alternatively, Westover's ""survivalist"" family were sitting on a few on-the-grid dollars that conveniently popped up when equipment needed repairs and people needed to go to college. It's also possible that the writing just lacked clarity.Facebook | Instagram!121!So good. So good. SO GOOD. Ok, I'll try to elaborate. Tara Westover's memoir is incredibly engrossing not just because of the rollercoaster of traumatic events that occur throughout her life, but also because of her ability to weave humanity and complicated familial relationships in her portrayal of events. While it's easy to take these events and market it like a thriller novel, it's that sense of reflection and poignancy in her carefully crafted words that is the book’s strongest asset. As awful as her family is, she tries to make them as multifaceted as possible by describing both the horrific treatment she dealt with alongside the tender moments that have made it hard for her to let go. I have always been either apathetic or critical about our education system, but I loved Westover’s insights that her education has afforded her to expand her worldview and transform her into her own individual. I would recommend this book to anyone who comes from a dysfunctional family as proof that you don’t have to be trapped in your circumstances and can seek a better life for yourself.A common critique is questioning how much of her memoir is embellished. My gut reaction is to take offense, as these dismissals have implications of not believing a victim of abuse and gaslighting her like her family did. But I know that all memoirs have degrees of embellishments, and it’s fair to have healthy skepticism. However, she peppers several footnotes throughout her memoir that point out contradictions in her memory based on different accounts of her siblings. This indicates that she is aware of how memories can be subjective, and the fact that she even clarified where her own perspectives differed and included different accounts showed that her priority was telling her story as truthfully as she can. That’s all you can really ask of someone bearing their life story. I believe the book and trauma she went through are completely valid, and her efforts in both staying true to her experiences while sharing different accounts reassure me in that validity.!121!To be honest, I don’t even know why I’m bothering to review this.There is no scenario in which I am a more trusted source than Obama, Oprah, the New York Times Book Review, and the Goodreads Choice Awards combined, and if they’ve all already told you to read this (which they have) then I don’t know why my recommendation would push this whole thing over the edge for you.If I am a more trusted source than all of those, then I just don’t know what to tell you. Besides the fact that I’m concerned for us both. But here we are, so. Introducing: My thoughts. My thoughts are: that this is a very good book.Truly groundbreaking stuff, I know.But really - it’s worth the hype. And this is coming from the girl who’s one-starred so many popular books she has an “unpopular opinions” shelf with hundreds of books on it.Can the New York Times Book Review say that?Maybe I should be the more trusted source.Anyway. This is not only beautifully written (and it is beautifully written), it’s stunningly recollected too. The emotional intelligence of the author is so vivid in every page. There is so much empathy here.This is already an incredible, gorgeous story, with a profound and impactful arc, but the talent of the author is what really makes it masterful.Bottom line: This is good sh*t.(You don’t get that kind of blurb from Oprah.)----------pre-reviewoprah was right.review to come / 4.5 stars----------tbr reviewall it takes to convince me to read a book is 500,000 ratings with a 4.48 average + a Goodreads award + tons of nominations + the New York Times, Barack Obama, Oprah, and every major publication naming it one of the best of the year.!121!I had a really tough time reading this book.The physical and emotional abuse made me want to put it down and forget about it. The manipulation, the abuse she went through left me speechless. While not unique, family issues are still so taboo. Brainwashing your own self into thinking it's your fault, that it wasn't that bad or that you imagined it will hit way too close for comfort for a lot of people.The author's writing was beautiful and her courage to get an education and stand up to her family was inspiring.Do recommend if you can stomach it.!121!Update: Honestly the hate I’ve received for this review has blown my mind. “you’re an idiot. And a bit of a dick. Grow up.”“Maybe the fact you struggled with mathematics for 16 years mean you struggle to appreciate quality storytelling.” Fucking hell. It’s my opinion. My review. You don’t agree that is absolutely within your rights but don’t start tearing me apart, because I will not argue with you. I’ll just delete your dick comments. *********************DNF on page 234I feel like I’m not reading the same book as everyone else? It’s boring. This happened, and then this happened and then the same thing happens again. Also I know this is supposed to be a memoir but am I honestly supposed to believe her mother survived a brain injury with not a jot of medical care? How she conveniently managed to scrimp enough money for the next semester of college borders on the unbelievable. Her brother is an asshole and I really don’t want to see how that unfolds. She teaches herself trigonometry. Honestly how? I studied maths in the school system for 16 years and still struggled with it. How does someone with absolutely no prior experience with it just teach herself maths at college level?! I know some people pick it up quicker than others but really?! She even gets 100% on an algebra test at college. Maybe I’m being overly harsh, but I’m just not having a good time - good on her for standing up for herself, but this is too wordy, definitely exaggerated and there are way too many other books in the world.!121!Every second of this book is enthralling!EVERY.SINGLE.SECOND.The tales in here are true. The stories are mind-blowing. The events are not from a time long ago - they happened in the past 20 years! You will have to keep reminding yourself of that because the mindset and ideas discussed sound antiquated, but they are alive and kicking . . . and that is just crazy!One thing that brought this story close to home is that at the time a lot of the events in this book we're taking place, I was living in Yellowstone National Park and frequently travelled to or through Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Salt Lake City and all points in between. This means I could have been mere miles away from the events in this book while they were taking place! Again, this seems impossible to me and I had to keep reminding myself that this was happening in my neck of the woods! And, because of this, my mind was repeatedly blown.I suppose I should mention what might be a trigger warning for some. Most of the men and some of the women in this book are described doing crazy and abusive things. I swear that every few minutes I had to stop, collect my thoughts, and say, ""Wow!"" While none of us were there to witness this and the author even says there are many who will deny the events and say that her version of the events are driven by the devil himself, they are shocking and will get your mind churning! I feel her frustration and so many times I wanted to reach into the pages and tell her, ""It doesn't have to be like this!""Also, another trigger warning, if you work for OSHA or help maintain OSHA workplace safety standards, you are going to probably throw this book across the room or at least slam it in disgust a few times.This book is amazing and I highly recommend it - I am driven to follow this up by hunting down interviews with the author.!121!“You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.”
Tara Westover lived her life like everyday was her last - literally. Her dad was a doomsday prepper.She spent her childhood stockpiling supplies, scrapping with her brothers and deeply in penance for her ""sins"". Hospitals were forbidden, schools were forbidden, everything was treated with a homeopathic cure and a long prayer.
My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.
She told again and again that she was worth nothing and shouldn't seek out a life.But...being told something and believing it are two different things. 
We are all of us more complicated than the roles we are assigned in the stories other people tell/
When she was seventeen, Tara went to school for the first time. It was an adjustment - to put it mildly - from her quiet, almost subservient role at home.But the longer she stayed away from home, the more she realized what exactly she was missing...and what she would have to leave behind to seek it.
Curiosity is a luxury for the financially secure.
Just... holy sh*t.Overwhelming... but in an addictive way. Like can't-put-down-its-crack level of addictingI read this one in a single day - and it was worth the late night and early mornings. There's something just so wholly compelling and riveting about her voice. The way she constantly questions and sought out something else - often without truly being aware of what that something else was.The sickly feeling that crept up upon me when her parents and siblings tried to sway her back.It was just amazing. Highly, highly recommended.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!Here's the thing: when I read a memoir, I'm looking for something real, something that encapsulates enough of the truth as to be authentic. But the events in this book are pretty unbelievable. Tara had never gone to school before applying for college. Her mom tried to homeschool her, but gave up early on. Without ever having studied or developed the discipline for learning, Tara teaches herself a variety of subjects well enough to ace the ACT and get into a good university. This all happens while she's simultaneously working for her dad at a junkyard, getting injured herself and watching others be grievously injured too, and being physically and emotionally abused by her brother.I believe people can do a lot if they put their mind to it, but this is pretty far-fetched. It's natural to embellish the truth in order to tell a good story, but I have to wonder how much of it was really true and how much was the embellishment. Sure, there is a small possibility that everything happened exactly as described. But it's so remote that I have trouble suspending my disbeliefs. If this was fiction, I'd be okay with it. But since it's billed as nonfiction, I'm kind of skeptical.But for me, the most frustrating thing about this memoir is reading about Tara justifying her brother's abuse towards her, and her parents' choice to turn the blind eye to what was going on. She's constantly rethinking what happened, with each subsequent version being more and more watered down until she no longer remembers if her brother even hurt her in the first place. She follows these people like a puppy, begging for their love and attention, even as they continue to mistreat and threaten her.Am I the only one who thinks that's just bananas? She's essentially using the book as a form of therapy to justify the behavior of people who abused her. I'm sorry, but I just can't get on board with that. It was exhausting to read, and it's not clear she made any real progress on getting past this. Even at the end, she seems ready to forgive her parents if they ever say the word.The writing style is philosophical and ruminating, with overly ornate language at times. There are so many passages in which she's overthinking things, but without gaining any of the key insight she really needs.It's ironic this book is called ""Educated,"" when it never makes clear if and what exactly she has learned through all of this.!121!5 brilliant stars to Educated! 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 I grew up in a home of readers with a teacher mom and a dad who questioned my effort when I made an A-minus on my report card. When I began reading Educated, I was floored that Tara and her siblings were not in school, and they were not homeschooled either. How could this happen in modern times with compulsory schooling put in place long ago? Tara made it clear from the start that her family’s Mormon faith did not cause her father’s substantial paranoia; however, he used his faith to feed it. This family not only did not have insurance, they did not believe in accessing traditional medical care. Horrific accidents and illnesses abounded due to the father’s and one sibling’s risk-taking, and no one went to the doctor. While the family was clearly having difficulty grappling with many things, I was struck by the love and devotion between them, even with the strained family dynamics. It was both fascinating and heartbreaking to watch those dynamics shift even more as Tara’s aspirations developed and were achieved. Strength. Grit. Perseverance. Tara’s tenacity resulted in her leaving the farm at Buck’s Peak and enrolling in college, after never attending a day of school. Her words were upfront, bold, but never complaining or looking for pity. Overall, I found Educated to be one of the most engaging, powerful, and inspiring memoirs I have read. Thank you to Tara Westover, Random House, and Netgalley for this reading experience I will treasure. Educated is now available!!121!Tara Westover’s book “Educated” is a distressing & discomforting - alarming & startling exposure of her Mormon fundamentalist family. “Educated” is a memoir of nonfiction - but names and identifying details have been changed. Aaron, Audrey, Benjamin, Erin, Faye, Gene, Vanessa, Judy, Peter, Sadie, Shannon, Shawn, Susan, Robert, and Robin are pseudonyms. Tara tells us in her authors notes: “This is not about Mormonism. Neither is it about any other form of religious belief. In it there are many types of people, some believers, some not; some kind, some not. The author disputes any correlation, positive or negative, between the two”. Yet....as I read this novel - I not only felt angry - sickened at times - but really conflicted too. I had duel thoughts from the beginning of this novel to the end. I ‘did’ think - in part this book was about Mormonism ( let’s call a spade a spade). Tara and her siblings had backpacks filled with supplies to defend themselves ready to “head-for-the-hills” ....ready to run ( away from the government).Her dad, Gene, feared that the government might one day try to intervene their lifestyle. They were living off the grid. The kids had no formal education, or medical care when sick or injured. Instead of going to the hospital when needed - their mother, midwife/herbalist cared for them with alternative remedies. The government might have even brought in social workers to evaluate the health their family. Abuse? YES! This family stayed hidden. Abuse in many forms was hidden. Tara’s memoir-impart- also details ( summarizes) the transitions and challenges entering the academic world -Brigham Young University- Harvard- Cambridge ( PhD in History). Her educational journey was interesting — some of it maddening to me also ....not faulting anyone - but it was painful for me to discover just how ‘much’ about the world - life changing world events a 7 year old knew - at age 17 she ‘didn’t’ know - yet somehow was studying at a University. I questioned ‘how was this even possible’? Amazing. Tara had great support from a church entering college...which was wonderful. At times I felt frustrated ‘besides’ some greatly disturbing horrific frightening descriptions during Tara’s childhood. Tara’s academic accomplishments were extraordinary—but I couldn’t find her voice. She seemed - fragile - and often so uncertain of herself. This book is very well written - ( gloomy -perplexing - and wearisome at times from repetitive trips back home to seek validation from her family)- but it seemed her education brought her almost as much pain as it did inner fulfillment. Because Tara disputes any difference between negative and positive —admirable in ways —I had a hard time getting an experience of ‘HER’. I admit it’s my own frustration. This young girl had a childhood I could never fully comprehend- or know what scars remain...but the fact stands — she's living proof that amazing change is possible. Tara calls that “an education”. Alright ....I agree....but I’m still sad and feel incomplete. ( it’s my problem - not hers). There have been comparisons to this book and “The Glass Castle”. I understand that — but in reality they are presented very differently. Not only does Jeannette Walls not change any names in her book — she had just freedom to go on National television with her homeless mother. She didn’t need to hide or change identifying details. Tara Westover felt the need to keep names hidden. ( less freedom between the author and her readers for full- self expression). I understand- but a little less satisfying. I DO FEEL THIS BOOK OUGHT TO BE READ ....I DO SEE THIS BOOK’S IMPORTANCE....a story about an American family living by their own rules - ignoring others who don’t follow their beliefs. WE SEE TARA WESTOVER’S SKILLFUL LYRICISM in this book....very impressive— one of the most inspiring aspects to me. With her achievements, education, and talent, we got a well-written fascinating SAD STORY.I will think about Tara - worry & wonder about her in years to come. It killed me that Tara continued time and time again to seek validation - I’m not sure it’s over. She kept going home to a place where her own brother tried to kill her —She almost begged her mother to see her time and time again too— it was soooo painful to me that her mother rejected her ——but just as painful that Tara kept needing their approval. All so sad. I UNDERSTAND....yet I can’t see who she is through her own behavior. Tara has an inspiring academic education— a relationship with 3 of her siblings but trying to regain a relationship with her parents - her violent brother - and even one of her sisters she was once very close to was like trying to get blood from a turnip....it just wasn’t possible. It made for very frustrating reading. Why did Tara keep trying to fill her heart with the family that rejected her several times? And were abusive? And can a book education take that pain away? These are questions that lingered with me. Tara had a sweet - warm- soft voice on NPR. Her interviewer called her dad a ‘character’. She agreed. All light and fluffy. Tara share About MANY HAPPY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES on NPR. I was a little confused listening to her. Was she happy or angry? She seemed so happy about her childhood. Huh? Yet for years she suffered abuse which she tells us in her book. On NPR:She said the junkyard was playful and exotic, but was dangerous....but also fun.She said the Mountain where she grew up was magical and beautiful.....but they were closed off from the rest of the world. Duality....duality...duality ...... is a word that Tara used over and over again on NPR. Tara see’s two sides to her entire life. I felt a little “duality” in this story myself. I still feel Tara herself is hidden from this story. Can’t put my finger on it. But one thing does hit home — we can’t meet the rest of her family like we were able to of Jeannette Walls. So - this is clearly TARA’S memoir....and I’ll respect it at that. This is a valuable powerful read but I’m guessing there might be more to this story one day. Thank You Netgalley, Random House, and Tara Westover ( congrats to you on your book - may you continue to find inner peace and happiness) 4.4 Stars!121!This one first came to my attention via a GR review. I thought wow, I need to read this now. The wonderful Traveling Sisters group set it up as a slow read and I was in. Grabbed a copy from NetGalley and was ready to go. BUT.....and a big BUT......I didn't like this one, I had to force myself to finish. Had it not been for the group read, I'm sure I would have DNF'd this one.So I'm probably in the minority in not liking this one. It was more of a 'having a hard time believing the story' kinda thing. Tara details her life growing up in the mountains. She paints a picture of this wild child who doesn't bathe, or wash her hands after using the toilet (her grandmother had a fit about this), is quite ignorant, but yet...she self teaches herself to get into a prestigious college. She talks about her childhood and her parents seems so bad - no schooling, must work and earn money, her father seems to be a religious zealot who harbors a fear of the govt, her mother creates tinctures that cure people from near death. It just became a bit much and I was having a hard time believing it all. Multiple car accidents, severe burns, head trauma, and all cured with herbs. But then she wants to go to school, so she does...college, gets a PhD. Where did she get the money? They didn't seem to have much money. Yet, being in the 'mountain' rustic home, they had a phone, tv, internet. I dunno, it was just getting to be a bit much for me to believe. She ended up having multiple siblings teach themselves, go to college, and get advanced degrees. Really?A memoir is defined as an autobiography or a written account of one's memory of certain events. Maybe this is how she remembers everything, maybe it really all happened this way. I really don't know. But it all just did not add up for me. I had so many questions about everything. I have a family member who remembers his childhood different from how I remember HIS childhood. So it happens. I'll just say thanks to NetGalley for an advanced copy of the read and this in no way influenced my review.!121!""Not knowing for certain, but refusing to give way to those who claim certainty, was a privilege I had never allowed myself. My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.""- Tara Westover, Educated: A MemoirThis book feels like it was written by a sister, a cousin, a niece. Tara Westover grew up a few mountains over from my dad's Heglar ranch. I don't know her. Don't know her family. She grew up about 70-80+ miles South East as the crow flies, but realistically, it was a 1.5 hours drive difference, and a whole planet of Mormonism over. I didn't grow up in Idaho. I was born there and returned there yearly. But this book is filled with the geography, culture, behaviors, mountains, religion, schools, and extremes I understand. She is writing from a similar, and often shared space. I didn't just read this book, I felt it on every page. Her prose was amazing. The memoir danced at parts, while a couple pages later, I would be sent up for air. I often found myself having to talk through parts of the book with my wife while reading. It flowed. Some books seem to remove friction while you read. My wife abandoned work for a day to read it. It consumed us.This book reads like a modern-day, Horatio Alger + The Education of Henry Adams: An Autobiography. However, it isn't just a book about how a girl with little formal education from a small town in Idaho makes it to Cambridge. It is also a tale of escape, and a historiography. Westover is using her own life to do a popular memory study on herself. She is looking at how she viewed her religion, her background, her parents, and her education. She explores how those memories and narratives change and reorient based upon proximity to her family, her father. These narratives especially begin to reorient as she becomes ""educated.""I bought a copy and before I even read it, I gave it to my father to read (He grew up in Heglar, ID). Then I bought another couple and yesterday and today my wife and I raced to finish our respective copies. We bored our kids talking about it over two dinners. We both finished it within minutes of each other tonight. Tara Westover's memoir hit me hard because of the struggle she has owning her own narrative. Through many vectors I related to her (we both graduated from BYU with Honors, were both were from Idaho, educated Mormons, and both have preppers in the family). My family, while sharing similar land, a similar start, and a similar undergraduate education, however, are not Tara's. And that is what made this memoir so compelling. It was like reading a Dickens novel, but one that was set in your neighborhood. It was moving, sad, and tremendous. In the end, I was attracted by how close the story felt, but I was also VERY grateful her story wasn't THAT close.!121!I grew up with my nose perpetually in a book. So, the idea of not being able to go to school, of being deprived of an education, hit me really hard. It was hard for me to grasp that things I take for granted, like knowing what the Holocaust was or who MLK, Jr. was, were black holes to Tara. Tara Westover is the child of a religious fanatic, someone who sees the government as pure evil. And by government, he means schools, hospitals, vaccines, seat belts, car insurance, etc. Everything we think of as civilization. His family awaits the Days of Abomination. There is a similarity here to The Glass Castle. Once again, we see how a mentally unbalanced father holds sway over an entire family. He thinks he speaks for God. Tara struggles with the knowledge that for her to go to school will mean a total separation from her father because he will never acknowledge that his ideas are not the correct ones. Parts of this book are cringeworthy. I found myself shaking my head that folks would allow severe suffering rather than a trip to the hospital or the use of real medicine. I’ll warn you that some of these sections are not for the faint of heart. The descriptions are sickening. I know little to nothing about the Mormon faith. Certainly, the faith of this family is not the true Mormon faith. But you get glimpses enough to also realize that there is a strong anti-woman bias in the faith and that women are definitely second class citizens. Broodmares more than humans on a par with men. This book doesn’t sugarcoat things. It’s not an education makes everything better kind of story. Tara continues throughout the book to struggle to find her way, to stand up for her beliefs. Hell, to find her own beliefs. This is an amazing book. It makes you realize how easy your life is. And how strong folks like Tara are to be able to rise above their beginnings and be able to fight back against the attempts of family to hold them down. I’m willing to bet this book makes it onto a lot of best of 2018 lists. It will certainly be on mine. Highly recommend! My thanks to netgalley and Random House for an advance copy of this book.!121!I don't want to disregard Tara Westover's life experiences or not believe her, so I am going have to settle on one of two options: 1) either she is not a very good writer;2) or her memories are often faulty and/or selective, with an emphasis on the macabre and tragic, which is understandable I guess.Much of Tara's misfortunes and fortunes seem to make no sense, or not explained well in the context of her life story. There are multiple miraculous recoveries from numerous life-threatening untreated injuries, a lot of magical money appearing out of nowhere to pay for things Tara needed, a bunch benevolent men throwing opportunities and scholarships at her. Either Tara was a very naturally gifted student or an extremely hard-working student, it's hard to tell. No case was made for either of these possibilities, if I accept that she had received NO structured education. (Does BYU have such low standards BTW?)The survivalist angle was entirely overblown by publicity around this book. If anything, Tara's family was careless and sloppy, with their main oddity being not believing in modern medicine. Canning peaches is not survivalism as far as I know. And it's quite hard to claim to be closed off from the world if you have TV, phone, internet and take dance classes in town. Too much of this story smells like BS, and I am not talking about the abuse, I have no reason to doubt that. It's the details that are a complete mess. The gaslighting Tara had experienced at the hands of her family was the most compelling part of her story actually.!121!JOYA.!121!A monumental memoir that should be required reading for all. The description doesn't do it justice. It's not about getting a PhD, it's about growing up in a family that doesn't believe in school, thinks doctors are a part of a sociologist conspiracy, and that any day the government will shoot them dead--if the end of times don't come first. The experiences Tara describes are horrific, yet oddly relatable--even if your family is nothing like hers (and let's hope it isn't). By the end, she has to come to terms with balancing family bonds and having the strength to see past their warped sense of reality.There's really no words to describe it, but I'd start with moving, inspiring, shocking and un-put-downable. Stop wasting your time reading this review and start reading the book! IT'S SO GOOD!!!!121!Masterpiece. Starts off slowly but definitely worth it.!121!Does anyone else smell that? Me smells a 

 

 (James Frey, A Million Little Pieces) rat here. This is what I hate about memoirs. An author can fill page upon page with a load of made up BS and we are meant to fall for it hook, line and sinker. I have made this argument before, even though a memoir is based upon the recollection of the author, it should still be FACTUAL! Let's begin at the beginning. I almost stopped reading this book at page 3. I read the alliterative phrase 'chirping crickets' three times on ONE page. I lived not far from where Tara Westover grew up and we had these:  MORMON CRICKETSNOT these:  REGULAR OLD CRICKETThere is no lovely cricket chirping sound with the first because they are not a cricket. They are actually a katydid. Ok, enough science. Westover is apparently all rolled into one. Jackie Chan because no one alive other than him has suffered the number of life-threatening injuries and survived to tell about - oh wait, except for Tara Westover. Confucius because of her astounding insight and prophetic sayings, and John Stuart Mill because Westover has got the philosophy of feminism down like no other philosopher since Mill. (At least that unsightly knot on Mill's forehead would jive with what Westover should look like if she had been through as many physical catastrophes as she claims).Westover is ready to give these singers a run for their money since she sings like a goddess after never opening her mouth before. WATCH OUT:   Tara Westover will be receiving her Grammy, Tony, Emmy and Oscar before she is 40, I am sure.That is if she is not too busy adding colloquialisms to the vocabulary for the rest of us. Hey, Tara, EVERYONE calls a blinding, windy winter storm a WHITE OUT. They didn't make that up in Idaho. Westover is the greatest thesis writer, the greatest dissertation writer, the greatest student Cambridge has ever seen. All while being a complete idiot. She goes from having no  (Sorry I couldn't resist taking a jab at the end of days BS in this book) to having enough  to fly to ROME and back and forth to the US countless times! That must have been one HELL of a PELL grant. Westover says ""...I'd been surprised to discover echoes of Mormon theology in the great philosophers of the nineteenth century."" Shouldn't that be the other way around - that Joseph Smith ripped off philosophers not that they thought he was so profound as to steal from him?  Her father would have been dead, dead, dead if he had suffered burns to the degree that she claims. He would have contracted an infection or pneumonia and would not have survived. And since the bottom of his face was gone as she purports, how was he able to hold a phone up to his shoulder? If his hands were so disfigured, how was he able to write, drive or BUILD AN EXTENSION on their house?! I could fill this review with inconsistency after inconsistency, but I am sick of this book. I am sick of hearing about it. I am sick of having read it. Some will ask why I read this whole book if I hated it so much. And the answer is that if I was going to be savage about this book, and I was, I wanted to read the whole thing. SOOOOOO, this savage spent the entirety of this book doing this: P.S. Hey Random House Publishing, I will be sending you my deats for a refund for this POS book. You can bet that all the made up shite in this book is going to come out sooner or later. Did you learn NOTHING from James Frey?!121!LIBERACI DAL PADRE(E possibilmente, liberaci pure dalla madre)”The Texas Chainsaw Massacre – Non aprite quella porta”. Make: 1974, regia di Tobe Hooper. Remake: 2003, regia di Marcus Nispel.È un esordio, e quindi parte delle mie osservazioni critiche a seguire potrebbero essere scusate dal debutto. Lo sono meno, ai miei occhi, perché di questo libro s’è voluto fare l’ennesima next big thing, è stato molto spinto, promosso, e discusso. Inquietante, dal mio punto di vista, la quantità di fotografie che si trovano di questa giovane scrittrice nata nel 1986: ho sempre l’impressione che in questi casi si usi la fotogenia di chi scrive per vendere di più, e magari coprire qualche magagna.”The Hills Have Eyes – Le colline hanno gli occhi”. Make: 1977, regia di Wes Craven. Remake: 2006, regia di Alexandre Aja.Un altro problema per me immenso, smisurato, è che il libro è sempre promosso a pieni voti per il suo contenuto, per la sua storia, e non per il modo di raccontarla. Ancora una volta la trama ha eclissato lo stile, il cosa annulla il come.”Winter’s Bone – Un gelido inverno”, regia di Debra Granik. 2010.La storia credo sia ormai abbastanza risaputa: famiglia numerosa (curioso come chi scrive commenti vari il numero dei Westover junior, per chi sono cinque, per chi sei – invece sono sette, e questo si aggancia a quanto dirò tra poco) e famiglia disfunzionale – un incrocio tra “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - Non aprite quella porta” più “Le colline hanno gli occhi” e dall’altra parte “Winter’s Bone – Un gelido inverno”. Se non che, nel caso dei Westover la violenza è diretta all’interno della famiglia stessa, ben più che all’esterno (anche se in casa circolano perfino armi antiaeree, e i vicini di casa portati come esempio di resistenza sono membri del White Power, Fratellanza Ariana).I figli non vengono registrati all’anagrafe, niente certificato di nascita, vengono convinti o forzati a mollare la scuola, o non frequentarla del tutto, a stare alla larga da medici e ospedali. Il tutto giustificato da una religione (mormone) che non sta in piedi neppure un istante: quale dio richiederebbe e/o approverebbe simili livelli di bestialità umana?!Poi, il tutto si giustifica invece col bipolarismo paterno.La più piccola di casa, Tara, è un magnifico esempio di resilienza, fiore nella concimaia che si redime e salva andando al college (approda addirittura a Cambridge e Harvard), studiando, educandosi, imparando. Un magnifico messaggio di speranza, che è bello raccogliere e far proprio.Una parte della famiglia Westover (quella vera).Ma all’ombra di questo splendido assunto si nasconde una scrittura senza sorprese, né bella né brutta, accessibile e piana, che per fortuna si tiene lontana dalle frasi memorabili e/o a effetto, ma affastella più che incidere.Soprattutto si nasconde un libro notevolmente disarticolato, oserei dire sgangherato. Senza ritmo. E senza una qualche struttura, magari anche ondivaga o contorta. Accelerazioni improvvise sono seguite da brusche frenate, scatti e salti anticipano passi indietro. Non parlo solo dei salti temporali, a quelli siamo abituati, quelli vanno più che bene: a me sembra che la giovane Westover avesse o molta fretta di sfogarsi, o cognizione di una fine da raggiungere in qualsiasi modo. Affronta ogni argomento, dalla descrizione della montagna alle violenze domestiche, con lo stesso identico tono, finendo, ovviamente, col piallare ogni cosa.Ho avuto spesso la sensazione di quegli scarabocchi che si schizzano mentre siamo al telefono o in riunione, e quindi, quando la nostra attenzione è altrove, e la mano gira e rigira, incide, rimane sullo stesso punto, e alla fine vattelapesca cosa volevamo disegnare, è solo un garbuglio di linee.Ho avuto spesso la sensazione di quei film dove uno viene pestato e ne esce con la gamba sinistra zoppicante e un brutto livido sullo stesso braccio – nella scena seguente, però, zoppica dalla destra, e il livido è sulla guancia invece che sul braccio.Il giardino di casa Westover. Back or front yard?Il primo esempio che mi viene in mente è la vicenda materna: dopo il primo incidente d’auto, subisce un’emorragia cerebrale, vive al buio con occhi diventati come quelli di un panda, ha emicranie, non prende medicine, solo erbe, dato l'impedimento religioso, si ha la netta sensazione che sia un processo irreversibile, molto probabilmente destinata a morte prematura… E invece non si sa dove, né come, né quando la madre torna in piena efficienza (fino al punto di poter subire un secondo incidente d’auto). E così avanti per tutto il libro. È stato notato da più parti che il livello di credibilità di quanto raccontato da Westover non soddisfa appieno.378 pagine che a me sono sembrate 3.780. Se non addirittura 37.800.Ma siccome il benedetto messaggio, o contenuto, è di quelli belli belli – ma siccome nella confusione qualche momento buono ci scappa, io tre stelle con qualche esitazione alla fine gliele do.Anche se ora, per giusto bilanciamento, la tentazione è andare a mettere la quinta a Elena Greco. E altrettante a Lila. Le mie amiche geniali.Idaho!121!“My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.” 

The above sentences have the entire essence of this book. This is Tara Westover's story, a home-schooled woman who struggled against all the hardships and got admission to the universities like Harvard and Cambridge. This book shows us the actual value of education and how it can change a person's life. This is a must-read book if you love reading memoirs.!121!Everything about this book amazed me. I will not stop thinking about this book for a very, very long time. I don't think I can even do this proper justice in a review other than telling everyone to go out and READ THIS BOOK! Easiest 5 stars ever. Loved it.!121!***Expect anything but get ready to get surprised***🤦Oh God...what did I just read?! 💔It's a perfect 5 🌟 read for me. Once I started reading the first few pages, I just couldn't stop reading it. Strange for me to say but when non-fiction tends to read this fictional good I am ready to read non-fiction anytime everywhere.Yes, this book seems like a fiction because we are not aware of the fact that such situations exist in real. If it was not for this book, I would have been so blind to such important issues which happen in families struggling with poverty, illiteracy, misguided religious beliefs, family violence and undiagnosed serious mental health conditions.Before I picked up this memoir, I used to believe that it is just about a girl who strived to get education and got successful in achieving that.But I say it is much, much more than that.This book is horrifying at times the way some events were really dark, violent and gruesome.I was on the edge of my seat until I read the back cover of the book.I understand when the author described how she experienced utter helplessness, getting pulled in opposite directions whether to let go of the family ties or to buckle under everything because it's her family. The hardest is when it's your own family that hurts you and you are left feeling all alone in the entire world. I could relate to this book at so many different levels. I am so glad I picked up this book!!121!‘my life was narrated for me by others. their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. it had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.’
i would generally consider myself to be a reserved person. i dont tend to actively share my thoughts, feelings, beliefs, or opinions. personal things like that, i usually to keep to myself. but after reading this book, it would be a shame to not express, in some form, how important i think education is. this story, this harrowing yet powerful story, only supports how i feel about the necessity for accessible formal education, as well as the importance to have a desire to educate oneself. taras experiences only prove the immense power of education - how education allows us to be able to consciously examine the world and judge/act accordingly, how striving to learn opens doors to possibilities we can scarcely imagine, and how educating ourselves ultimately gives us the strength of having our own voice. and so, i have no reservations for saying that i am of the strong opinion that this raw and contemplative story is one every person should read. *note: i have been told that i can be a negative nancy from time to time. whilst reading this, there were several aspects of taras story that didnt quite add up to me. i believe every reader should have a healthy ounce of skepticism within them, and mine was causing little red flags to pop up here and there. i appreciate the authors candidness about the unreliability of childhood memories. so although i took the extreme nature of the books content with a grain of salt, it did not detract from the overall message of this book - the importance of education - and so i rated based on that. ↠ 4.5 stars!121!Educated, Tara WestoverTara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard. Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent. Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home. Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه ژانویه سال2019میلادیعنوان: دختر تحص��لکرده، یک سرگذشت؛ نویسنده: تارا وستور؛ مترجم هوشمند دهقان؛ تهران نیلوفر‏‫، سال1397؛ در448ص؛ شابک9789644487767؛ موضوع: سرگذشت تارا وستوور، خانواده؛ از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21متارا وستور در ماه سپتامبر سال1986میلادی به دنیا آمد؛ او در شهر «آیداهو» از ایالت‌های غربی «آمریکا» زندگی می‌کرد؛ محل زندگی او سرزمین کوه‌ها، جنگل‌ها، و دره‌ های ژرف بود؛ «تارا وستور» زندگیش در سرزمین دوران کودکی‌ خویش را، این‌ چنین توصیف می‌کنند: «من با ضرباهنگ کوهستان بار آمدم، ریتمی که در آن دگرگونی‌ها هیچگاه بنیادی نبود؛ تغییرات کوهستان همیشه دوره‌ ای بود؛ هر صبحگاه، خورشید همیشگی طلوع می‌کرد، از این سوی دره به آنسو می‌غلتید و در پشت کوه پنهان می‌شد؛ برف‌هایی که در زمستان می‌بارید در بهاران آب میشد»؛او در خانه به دنیا آمد؛ تا نه سالگی شناسنامه نداشت؛ و پیش از هفده سالگی به کلاس درس پا نگذاشت؛ در منزل، نزد مادر درسی خواند، ولی بیشتر اوقاتش صرف کار در حیاط قراضه‌ های پدر، و جا کردن آذوقه در شیشه‌ های مربا شد؛ این همه بدان خاطر بود، که پدر و مادرش در زمرهٔ «مورمون‌»هایی بودند، که خود را برای آخرالزمان آماده می‌ساختند، و نسبت به آموزش دولتی، امور طبی، و بیمارستان، و پلیس فدرال، بدگمان بودند؛ «تارا» در کنار کوه «باک» و در دنیای کوچکی میبالد، که عقاید بیمارگونهٔ پدر، سخت بر آن سایه افکنده است؛ رفته رفته، اما ذهن «تارا»، دست به خودکاوی می‌زند، و عطش دانش، در او بیدار می‌شود، و خانه و خانواده را، به هوای تحصیل ترک می‌گوید…؛ «تارا» سر از جایی درمی‌آورد، که به خواب هم نمی‌دید؛ این کتاب ماجرای همین سرگذشت دلنشین، و پرفراز و فرود است؛ کتابی که بلافاصله ایشان را، شهره ساخت، و به گفته ی بسیاری، از جمله ویراستاران «آمازون»، «نیویورک‌ تایمز»، «باراک اوباما»، «بیل گیتس» و…؛ در ردیف بهترین آثار سال2018میلادی قرار داردنقل از متن کتاب: (حساب بانکی‌ام مدام آب می‌رفت؛ ترس برم داشته بود، که مبادا نتوانم واحدهایم را پاس کنم، ولی یک ماه مانده به پایان نیمسال، بعد از پرداخت شهریه، اجاره خانه، و خرید خوراکی و کتاب، کم کم این فکر به سرم زد، که حتی اگر واحدهایم را پاس کنم، به خاطر یک دلیل مشخص به دانشگاه باز نخواهم گشت: نمی‌توانستم از پس مخارجش بربیایم؛ در اینترنت شرایط احراز بورس تحصیلی را پیدا کردم؛ معافیت از شهریه، مستلزم آوردن معدل تقریبا کامل بود؛ هنوز یک ماه تا پایان نیمسال فرصت داشتم، با وجود این می‌دانستم بورسیه شدن، به طرز مضحکی، دور از دسترس است؛ تاریخ آمریکا داشت برایم آسان‌تر می‌شد، منتها فقط به این معنا که دیگر تمام امتحانات ماهانه‌ ام را خراب نمی‌کردم؛ عملکردم در درس تئوری موسیقی خوب بود ولی در انگلیسی دست و پا می‌زدم؛ معلم زبانم گفت که در نوشتن استعداد دارم، ولی زبان نگارشم به طرز نامانوسی رسمی، و قلمبه سلمبه است؛ به او نگفتم نوشتن و خواندن را، از طریق خواندن کتاب مقدس مورمون، و خطابه‌ های «جوزف اسمیت» و «بریگم یانگ» آموخته‌ ام؛ گرچه مصیبت اصلیم درس تمدن غرب بود؛ درس گفتارهایش برایم ثقیل بود، شاید بدین خاطر که تا اواخر ژانویه فکر می‌کردم اروپا یک کشور ا��ت، و نه یک قاره، و در نتیجه بیشتر حرف‌های استاد برایم نامفهوم بود؛ تازه بعد از سئوالی که در مورد هولوکاست پرسیده بودم، دیگر جرات نداشتم برای روشن شدن ذهنم سئوال کنم؛ با این وصف، به خاطر وجود ونسا، تمدن غرب، کلاس مورد علاقه‌ ام بود؛ از او خوشم می‌آمد، چون شیوه ی «مورمون» بودنش مثل خودم بود: لباس یقه اسکی و گشاد می‌پوشید، و به من گفته بود هیچ‌وقت کوکاکولا نمی‌نوشد، و یک‌شنبه‌ها تکالیفش را انجام نمی‌دهد؛ در دانشگاه ونسا تنها کسی بود که مثل کافرها به نظر نمی‌رسید!)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 08/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 27/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club']"
Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking (Hardcover),Susan Cain,4.08,432535,2012,"The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content.","“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I read this book for the same reason most people read this book: I am an introvert. I have always been an introvert, and it's a fundamental, sometimes limiting, part of who I am. I've learned to deal with it better over the years - learned to clasp my shaking hands together during presentations, force myself to breathe normally and keep my voice steady, even force myself to make the first move in social situations. Unless you are also an introvert, you probably won't understand the efforts I have to go to (and the psychological strain this puts on me) just to behave in a way that is considered socially acceptable and is desired by employers.It's actually caused me upset and distress for many reasons. Firstly because I find it hard to cope in the many situations where bright, outgoing personalities thrive. Secondly because it's just considered a negative trait. Look at magazines, look at books like How to Win Friends and Influence People, look at job applications asking for ""people persons"". I remember reading teen magazines in high school and seeing stupid articles about how to attract boys - confident, dazzling personalities are a necessity! - and feeling a very real blow to my self-esteem.But I have accepted it as an unfortunate fact of reality for years - the simple conclusion that being introverted is a bad thing. Not a terrible thing, and definitely not an impossible thing to cope with - technology billionaires are often introverts after all - but something limiting (like a lower intelligence) that I must constantly battle against to make it through this world.Until I read this book.Susan Cain uses facts, statistics and her own case studies to show that introverts are greatly successful and powerful, not in spite of their introversion, but because of it. She compares different types of businesses and teamwork to show how extroverts and introverts each excel in different types of business environments. For example, extroverts often lead businesses better when there is little input from other team members; whereas introverts thrive in situations that rely on the input of a team because they are more likely to listen to the other members and implement their ideas.From Harvard Business School students to Ivy League professors to Rosa Parks, Cain looks at the different types of influence introverts and extroverts have. She does not place favour on one or the other, but instead portrays a view of the world in which both have an extremely important part to play - it just so happens that the extroverts tend to be ""louder"" about it. It's an important, engaging book that pulled along even a lover of fiction and fantasy like me. And, though comforting, it is still a respectable study that achieves more than just making introverts feel a little better about themselves. The findings speak for themselves and not only serve to please a shy little weirdo like me, but also make a lot of sense.An important read for introverts and extroverts alike.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr!121!I always thought I was just weird...I can be alone in my car for a 1h drive and not want to have the radio or music on. On sundays I often join the walking club for a long 25km walk, but I prefer to do it alone (and oh, all the pity looks you get!). The idea of surprise parties makes me sick to my stomach, and any event where a thousand people are together is possibly even worse. I dislike small talk, but I probably hate even more how nervous I get when I have to do it. I can feel sad for a bruised tomato no-one wants to buy (hey, he tried his best too, not his fault someone dropped him!), and while everyone else goes to the modern, light apothecary across the street with the super nice people always happy to help, I go to the dark and older one who never has clients (how else will he survive?)Turns out I'm not that weird. I'm just a full blood introvert. And yet, I'm not what you think. I'm not particularly shy, I'm not the grey bird that never says a word and everyone forgets she's around. I'm very opinionated and quite stubborn, and when amongst friends I know well, I can be the loudest person in the room. But still I'm introvert. After being with friends or colleagues, I need recharging time. I need to be alone. I (almost) always think before I talk. I enjoy getting to the bottom of things, I enjoy detective work. And I can go on and on.While reading this book, on occasion I was nodding so hard I thought my head might fall off.There were very little eye-opening surprises in this book, and even a few things I didn't agree with or I would have hoped for her to explore more. Even a few occasions I thought she was idealizing introverts. This book was not perfect, but somehow i feel that it was important for me to read it.Overall, it was quite liberating. I'm not that weird! About a third of us on this planet (and on a website as Goodreads probably a LOT more) are more or less like me - not completely like me, I'm still unique (I insist!)But that might not be an issue. Though some of you might recognize some of my examples above, I've never met someone before that can feel bad for a bruised tomato. So maybe i'm still little weird, and my own unique self. Hoorah!121!March 6th was Super Tuesday and I live in that Oh-so-much-talked-about-battle-ground-state of Ohio. I work the elections as a Ballot Judge, which means I hand out the ballots to the voters and give them instructions. I get to talk and talk, for 13 hours straight *sigh*. I try to make it entertaining for the voters, myself and the others I work with because of its repetition, but by 7:30 pm when the polls close I don’t think the language I was using was English.My spiel went something like this…….Me: “Hi. What ballot can I get for you today?”Voter: “Uh…….what do you mean?”Me: “Today we have, Democratic, Republican, Libertarian or Green (I have never given out the last two)”.Voter: “What’s a Green party?”Me: “I’m not sure, but there is next to nothing on their ballot.”Voter: “I’m and independent (code for embarrassed Republican) can’t I have both a Democratic AND Republican ballot?”Me: “No, you must declare one and you will be that party until the next primary. Ohio is a closed primary state.”Voter: “Uh….then give me a *whispers* a Democrat one.”Me: *loudly* “Democratic it is! Take all this to a table and vote, when you are done bring everything back to Rosemary in the red sweater by that machine. Make sure to tear off the stub on the bottom of the ballot…….the one that is marked “do not detach” when you come up to the machine. If you don’t, you will make Rosemary angry (a very sweet and very old woman) and you won’t like her when she’s angry. She will cover you in I Voted stickers.”This resulted in lots of chuckles, but I did it 301 times. I was drained. I slept for 12 hours that night. Twelve. Grant it, I got up at stupid O ‘clock to get to the polls by 6 am and maybe had 4 hours of sleep, but I was just a shell my former self. I am an introvert. Introverts and extroverts are most easily determined by how their energy is drained and how it is refreshed. Extroverts are drained when they have spent too much time alone, and the opposite is true for introverts. So for me, my life force was gone.In the United States our culture is biased towards the extrovert. We are about the loudness, the out there, the utter insanity if you will. In school “poor Johnny is so quiet, he needs to come out of his shell.” I want to scream “Leave him alone…..he’s FINE, he likes his shell!” School rooms now do this Pod thing where they pull four desks together and make these poor kids work as a team. WTF? No way would have that “concept” worked for me and it’s not working for introverted kids.“There’s no I in team” and that is a damn dirty shame.I haven’t worked in an office setting in years, so when I read in this book that office places are arranging offices areas with an open concept, everybody face to face with no walls. Workers going about their day, shooting the shit, getting ideas……brainstorming (which doesn't work). Who in the hell thought that one up? What a nightmare. What if I only tolerate a certain co-worker……now I have to stare at his annoying face all day, every day? How is anything ever accomplished? Companies are beginning to realize this mistake and are changing things up. Google (I think it was them) designed their offices with food, bathrooms and the like all in the center, like a town center, with offices around the edges. It is designed for casual meetings where ideas everyone figured out in their quiet offices are shared and expanded.Introverts are a third to half of the population. Many of these don’t even know they are introverted, because of the push to be extroverted has made them fool themselves into thinking they were extroverts.Another interesting thing I learned from this book is that extroverts are motivated by rewards. They work toward things, and take risks if need be to get to the goal of getting that reward. Extroverts are soooo happy when they get the reward.Introverts are motivated by fear. So they do things more cautiously, careful not to mess things up in the process of getting to a goal. That sounds like me. It’s doesn't sound cool that I am afraid to F things up, but I am.This book is interesting, whether you are an I or an E. Because if you’re not an introvert, odds are you know and love one.Also posted at Shelfinflicted!121!In a twist that will surprise precisely no one, this book spends a fair amount of time cheering for introverts. What were the odds, right? I assume if you're picking this book up you're on board with that to a certain extent, and likely something of an introvert yourself. This book is certainly for you-or for the perplexed extrovert or ""pseudo-extrovert"" that might be confused by your supposedly mysterious ways. It's a sort of shield, a blockade, a set of reinforced walls that Cain feels it is necessary to throw up around introverts (particularly American introverts) to protect them from the ""Extrovered Ideal,"" of American socialization. The tone of the beginning of the book is thus rather defiant, like Cain is screaming back at everyone she has ever felt pressured by to go to a happy hour or to a dinner party when she had much rather just read a book instead. There's some of this kick-back throughout the book, with plenty of cathartic/sympathetic/rather relatable war stories from introverts just tryin' to make it in an extrovert's world. It is particularly meant to speak to introverts in the high flying business, legal, and/or educational world, where a premium is put on socializing, teamwork, constant connection and multitasking (I am speaking here particularly of the rarefied worlds of Big Law, Wall Street Finance, and Ivy League academia). It's a very career and work focused book, with a surprisingly frequent focus on the bottom line about what traits introverts are more likely to have and how these should be recognized at the top tables in all fields. Her argument, based on one scientific study after another throughout the chapters (deployed like so much artillery), is that introverts tend to think more deeply about problems and persist for longer in trying to solve them. Introverts are supposedly more likely to care about the feelings of others, to make excellent compromising leaders, and to be excellent negotiators (Cain's particular area of expertise) based on their ability to seem soft and actually be tough at the same time. She scorns the merely ""shy"" as extroverts in disguise who share extroverts' traits and want the spotlight but who are just too scared to get it (she would never say this outright, but it is clear that she believes they don't deserve the secret introvert password and is determined to keep out the riffraff). She argues that the extroverts in powerful positions she has seen are more likely to take unjustified risks, to get hopped up on testosterone and the thrill of the chase, to listen to the loudest person in the room, and to walk all over introverts.She readily admits the nuances in these sweeping generalizations. She also admits the worth of extroverts and how introverts greatly enjoy and need their company, both professionally and personally. In addition, she also talks about some legitimate times when introverts may devote time and energy to being extroverted (if they care about something enough- ""Free Trait Theory""). Finally, and in the part that I most appreciated, Cain talks a bit about the ""Situational"" theory of personality- that is, that people's personalities can be completely different in different situations, times and around different people. Therefore, there are very few ""pure"" introverts or ""pure"" extroverts. She also admits that the way that these generalized ""traits"" play out may look very different and may, after all, not be very predictive in any direct way. (Many extroverts may have excellent impulse control, or introverts who care deeply about a cause may act frequently and completely out of character in order to fight for what they believe in.)However, the space devoted to these arguments is much, much smaller than the space devoted to proving, endlessly, how awesome introverts are and why the professional world should value them and stop trying to tell them that they have to be like extroverts because I'm okay and you're okay and it takes all kinds and a village to make the world go round.And honestly? This is a message that's happening to hit me at the right time, when I'm involved in a workplace with a whole lot of extroverts surrounding me. I did find it useful in my particular mindset where I am actively waging a struggle to define my own style in a new profession, since introversion is a part of my identity. I also thought that some of the studies she cited DO make a lot of sense and should be more widely looked at (like the ones that talk about why it's a good idea to ask people to provide feedback and brainstorm online rather than in big meetings or why introverts with closed door offices are more productive or some of the advice to parents about how to cherish their introverted child). I also think that it's nice to have someone sounding the alert that someone speaking quietly is not wrong by default- turn on cable news for thirty seconds and you'll be reminded why that is important.And yet, despite the evident time put into this book, and despite my bias towards it, I couldn't shake the feeling of cynical questioning of what felt like a great deal of pop psychology and arguments made based on feelings, anecdotes and newspaper clippings collected into a narrative. It felt like a file you might keep to make yourself feel better and to express an important part of your identity, rather than a research paper and I'm sure it was aiming at something closer to that crossed with an advice column. There's such a lot of speculation in here, and lots of scientific studies without citations or countervailing evidence brought into play. (For example, it certainly didn't help that the minute after I read one of the more fluffy scientific studies in here about how we Americans as a culture are more drawn to people that display significantly more traditionally dominant body language in pictures I saw it in an issue of Marie Claire in a box near the back of the magazine reconfigured to be about women being attracted to men and how you've gotta look aggressive and Manly to get us ladiezz don't you know?) It just seems like a book written for a specific audience that you can rely on to make that leap to ""just know"" what you mean because they've got an emotional bank of misunderstood years and moments to draw on. In short, it appeals to an ""emotional truth"" built on hundreds of pages of stories and studies that may or may not add up to anything at all. On the one hand, it's maybe okay to create a space for a ""community"" of sorts to feel and process some of that- on the other hand, it will drag down the overall quality of that work into something closer to a melancholy history crossed with a dinner party argument. Therefore, despite its strengths, and despite the personal enjoyment and help that I have taken from the book at this particular time, I can't rate it as more than an above average read. An intellectualized comfort read for introverted professionals, really, if such a specialized category really exists. I can't rate it higher when I feel like one good scholarly journal review would take the whole theory down, especially when it feels like an argument for corporations to pay introverts more a lot of the time. Nonetheless, a lot of interesting questions asked, a lot of self-reflection inspired. Recommended for my fellow introverts if you're at a place where you feel like something like I described above might be helpful to you at this time. Otherwise, I'd say you could skip it or just watch her TED talk instead.!121!If you’re a member of Goodreads, chances are pretty good that you’re a bit of an Introvert! Nothing wrong with that, cause you probably see and feel - intuitively - things that most extroverts can’t see or hear.This book will let you know that we Introverts are INVALUABLE in an extroverted world: Places like the business world where our insights are KEY to responsible decision-making. Extroverts shoot from the hip (watch out - they use Real bullets!) but often Shoot Off their Mouths, as well.We can give balance, discretion and Wisdom (that’s Key) to their choices - cause often, they’re the senior managers we report to.I once had an extremely affable team player as a boss. He took the flak for us middle managers when they vented their ire. Alas - he eventually cracked under their brute force and left our organization.I am happy to report that he ended up using his affable wisdom as a personal investment counsellor. I KNEW he had it in him to succeed. God bless him.He was a “win/win solution” sort of mediator. A dove who just drowned in a shark-infested pool.But towards the middle of his career, he imparted a VERY wise aperçu about my taking the flak from the ‘sharks’ lying down: for he simply said, “Fergus, you’re the Little Dutch Boy with his finger in the Dike!” Remember that story?Sure you do! I was Afraid of my own Shadow.They were the best words I could have heard back then, and they echoed in my mind for years afterward. And their moral?We introverts Must Own our Shadows!As an affable, insightful contributor to a brash bunch of extroverts’ decision-making.My wonderful boss ALIENATED his shadows.Don’t let that happen. KNOW YOURSELF...Be Fair, Firm and above all, FRIENDLY...And then, GO FOR IT.Don’t Wimp Out, like I did back then, cause...Baby, you’ve GOT WHAT IT TAKES - RIGHT THERE - INSIDE OF YOURSELF!!!!121![Original review, Dec 29 2016]This book, which I had had recommended to me by many friends both on Goodreads and in real life, says plenty of useful and worthwhile things. Using the words not quite in the sense common among academic psychologists, Susan Cain distinguishes between ""extroverts"", whom she characterizes as loud, thick-skinned people who prioritise social interaction, assertiveness and gregariousness, and ""introverts"", quiet, thin-skinned people who prioritise sensitivity, harmony and understanding. She points out that a third to a half of all people are introverts; though many of them have learned how to masquerade successfully as extroverts, since American society encourages extrovert behavior to the point where many introverts feel there is something wrong with them. Why do they prefer to sit and read a book when they could be out making useful business contacts? Cain give reasons to believe that the difference between introversion and extroversion may well be related to underlying brain physiology, and hence beyond the individual's control. But more importantly, she argues that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being introverted. Society needs sensitive, risk-shy introverts just as much as it needs brash, risk-tolerant extroverts. In fact, it may need them more.I find most of the above plausible, though I don't know enough about neurophysiology to be able to say how solid those parts are. What disquiets me most is that the book needed to be written in the first place. It seems to me to say more about modern American society than it does about the differences between introverts and extroverts. As Cain says, many societies - she particularly singles out Asian societies - do not place the same premium on extroverted behavior. If you're an Asian teen, it's regarded as normal to spend your time studying rather than partying. The same is true, though to a lesser extent, of many European societies. Cain's approach is gentle and indirect, but she certainly succeeds in showing how grotesquely skewed the US has become. When a member of an evangelical church says he is only interested in recruiting extroverted people and adds that he's sure Jesus was extroverted, I can't help feeling that something has gone horribly wrong. Even more memorably and presciently (the book was published in 2012), Cain asks at one point how America could have got the idea that the ideal personality type is that of a successful real estate salesman.How indeed?___________________[Update, May 31 2018]A remarkable passage I just read in Gwendolyn Seidman's widely cited paper ""Self-presentation and belonging on Facebook: How personality influences social media use and motivations"" (2012):Extraversion is related to several belongingness-related constructs. Extraverts have more friends, higher quality friendships (Asendorpf & Wilpers, 1998) and more satisfying romantic relationships than introverts (White, Hendrick, & Hendrick, 2004). Thus, it is unsurprising that extraversion is associated with greater Facebook use (Gosling, Augustine, Vazire, Holtzman, & Gaddis, 2011; Wilson, Fornasier, & White, 2010) and more friends (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010; Moore & McElroy, 2012; Ryan & Xenos, 2011).!121!I am an introvert and PROUD!
I am sure this is not totally surprising considering my huge love of books and writing. I am also sure many users (if not most of us) are introverts here on Goodreads. And Susan Cain is one of us and she celebrates it. This is a book about our strengths, and our weaknesses; it is a book about realising that although we do not fit the ideal model for success, we can still be dramatically successful given the right circumstances and a chance to shine. We are the creative thinkers and the critics. We are the over analysers. We are those that prefer to retire to the inner-workings of our own world when we’ve had enough of people and society. We are those that would rather think than talk. And that is our greatest weapon. 
“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I am going to talk a little bit about me and my own experience. I have done jobs that are characteristically more suited to extroverts. For many years I worked as a theatre front of house manager, overseeing large teams in an extremely busy entertainment venue. I also worked as a running-shoe salesman in a top-end sports shop offering great customer service and advice. What made me effective in such roles was my ability to keep a level head and analyse the situations I was in and then make the best response after thinking things through. I lead from the back. My approach to management was always subtle, but it worked. My point is, and Susan Cain’s point is, we can do all the same things extroverts can do. We will just do them a little bit differently. She does not say that introverts are better people. She does not say that the extrovert ideal is necessarily wrong. What she advocates for is another side of the story, another ideal and another type of person who can use what they have to their own advantage once they understand their worth. 
“Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured.”
And this is so important to understand. We need to embrace our introvert nature because it makes us unique and more in control of our thoughts and emotions. I truly wish I understood this simple fact at a younger age because I spent many years miserable as a teen because my personality did not compute with what was considered ideal. So, this is an excellent book and I feel that it will be of immense use to many people, not just introverts. In order to succeed as a species, we need to recognise – and celebrate – the simple fact that we are all uniquely different. 
Some of the most brilliant of people have been introverts

But if you sit back and think about what the author wrote, you may have a totally different opinion.I came to know about Susan Cain many years ago from her Ted talk about the power of introverts. A couple of weeks ago, I bought the latest book by the author called Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole. I finally picked up this book, so I can read the latest book after finishing this book, even though both are unrelated. After completing this book, I am now confused about whether to read her latest book.This book starts by discussing about the advantage of extroverts. The author then shifted gears to discuss the benefit of introverts which in turn, unfortunately, landed in those gray areas of lambasting extroverts both directly and indirectly. I felt the author was confused between introverts, mood disorders, and personality disorders in some areas. That is clearly reflected in the words she tries to explain about introverts. In some areas, she tried to mention some general topics that were not at all needed for a book about introverts, making it a poorly written self-help book in those parts. The author's lack of scientific knowledge regarding what she is trying to discuss is also reflected in multiple places in this book. It is true that there are some good quotes in this book. The topic the author chose to discuss and even the title of the book was great. Still, I have to say that this is a poorly written, poorly edited, overrated book.—————————————————————————

There are various introvert webcomics, TED talks about why introversion is so great, and numerous people who will tell you that they are an introvert and subject you to discussion and analysis of what this means with the same enthusiasm of someone who reads horoscopes. People confess to introversion with the same kind of humble bragginess as self-obsessed artists who roll their eyes when you compliment their art and say it was ""just a sketch.""It's true that being quiet or shy (note: these are not the same thing) used to be considered a bad thing. I grew up at the height of ""party culture,"" when all things club or frat were popular. Jersey Shore was on TV, skirts were short, hair was frosted, and everything was superficial and light. If you couldn't fizz and glitter like a sparkler in everyday conversation, you were weird and everyone hated you. I was weird, and people were not fans of me. I wore all black, read Anne Rice, and listened to Evanescence and The Cure while pondering why all of my classmates were idiots. My scorn probably didn't help, but there was absolutely no way at the time I could have fit it, or been happy doing so.Skimming through the reviews, I noticed I was one of the few self-professed introverts who despised this book. I thought that was interesting, but it's not completely unforeseen. I actually self-describe as a ""social introvert"" or ""false extrovert."" People who meet me for the first time think I'm very extroverted. I can be very loud and chatty, and organize a lot of social events in my office or with friends. But I'm also very uncomfortable in certain social situations and as much as I enjoy being out, I'm sometimes secretly delighted when plans are canceled and enjoy spending time by myself.It's been a while since my psychology days, but there is a chemical basis for introversion and extroversion. One of these lies in the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems. People who are introverted have a lower threshold for being overstimulated, and when they reach that threshold, feel drained and must rest. People who are extroverted, on the other hand, have a lower threshold and need to seek out stimulation in order to get the bar up. If they don't get stimulation, they feel sluggish and depressed. I thought the neurotransmitter in question was dopamine, but a quick Google makes it look like the neurotransmitter in question is actually acetylcholine. #TILI have taken issue with a lot of these pop psychology books. I wasn't a fan of THE SBUTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK, which seemed like the self-help version of snake oil, and recently also read SNAKES IN SUITS, which was like a Lifetime movie wearing science like it was a pretty dress. This one had a bit more science, but Susan Cain definitely spent way too much time cherry picking her arguments and the end result was me having a bad taste in my mouth and wanting to roll my eyes.I guess I have a few take-away points here. 1. Introverts and extroverts serve different functions in society. Neither is an intrinsically good or bad trait, and they are not binary. Like many human characteristics, these exist on a spectrum.2. We live in a social society, and acting antisocial to coddle your introversion makes you look, well, antisocial (confrontational, against society) instead of asocial, which is just wanting to be left alone.3. It's probably true that a lot of introverts were responsible for inventions because they spent a lot of time alone, but this is not the only type of genius or the only form genius takes. As I said in point #1, humans exist on a spectrum, and there are many different shapes of brilliant minds out there.4. People enjoy belonging to groups. That's why horoscopes are so popular, and why people post their Meyers-Briggs results on their dating websites. We live in an in-group vs. outgroup society - yes, you too, introverts, jeez - and enjoy feeling as though we belong. Introverts like calling themselves introverts because it makes them feel a bond with other introverts (seriously, just read the comments sections of any of the positive reviews for this book), which promotes bursts of probably dopamine.5. The author seems to be claiming that extroverts have the natural advantage and are mean to introverts but then spends a big part of the book shitting all over them. Hypocrite. At the end of the day, you should take books like these with a grain of salt. They're definitely more self-help geared than scientific, in my opinion,and a lot of the arguments and conclusions feel cherry-picked. Introverts may enjoy reading it while vigorously patting themselves on the back, but we as a society are moving in a direction where this is starting to feel kind of redundant and narcissistic.1 star!121!Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is about being an introvert in today's society.Confession time: I'm a tremendous introvert. I know you're all thinking something along the lines of ""What? A guy who reads constantly and writes over a hundred book reviews a year is an introvert?"" Shocking but true. I could easily go days without human contact. At parties, I'm the guy hanging out near the food or snooping through the host's books or medicine cabinet. I could go into more detail but since I have a feeling most Goodreaders are also introverts, I'll skip it.Basically, the book is a flashing neon sign that says it's okay to be an introvert. Susan Cain chronicles her own struggles as an introvert, as well as showing how America went from being about character to about personality, right around the time movies and TV started getting popular. It covers introverts in all areas, like corporate America, and how introverts are treated in other societies. There's a lengthy section on raising introvert kids, which a lot of parents could use instead of shoving their kids into the shark-infested extrovert waters.Honestly, I could have used this book as a teenager, when people were constantly badgering me to go out more. Scientific discoveries and works of art are rarely made by people who are constantly talking. Cain covers topics like being an introvert in the business world, where people who talk the loudest get their way more often than not, something I see every day in cubeland.Actually, the book gave me insight into the behavior of some of my family. Until he retired, my dad was crabbier than Red Foreman all the time. I used to think he was just an angry asshole but now I think he was an introvert with nowhere to unwind. Now that he's retired, I see how much alike we are. He's actually pretty friendly as long as the visits don't go too long. Susan Cain's writing style is engaging. I felt the repeated examples may have padded the book a bit. While I felt validated by reading it, sometimes it felt like a book a kid named Matthew, who happened to be missing a finger, wrote about how nine-fingered Matthews are the best at everything. I liked it but most of what Cain says seemed pretty obvious. There are no mind-blowing revelations for introverts within. I do recommend extroverts read it, however. 3.5 out of 5 stars.!121!What an affirmation! While listening to this book, I was constantly reminded of Al Franken’s Saturday Night Live character, Stuart Smalley, and his mantra, “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.” Well, those who understand me do. Full disclosure, according to the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, I’m an ISFJ.There were so many points of affirmation for me—things I intuitively knew. Things I’ve tried to share with others mostly to no avail. This book supplies all the data I need to support my case. Unfortunately, I don’t think the people who need to read/listen this book (extroverts) will.The book is not an “introverts are superior” diatribe but rather an explanation of how we can leverage personality types most effectively. There is no right or best personality type but like life in general, we need to understand each other for more harmonious relationships. Whether these relationships are family, work, or social, applications of understanding are documented throughout the book.There was one example in the book that hit particularly close to home. Although SAT or IQ scores do not support it, people who talk more are perceived as leaders. And, which personality type talks more? Extroverts. Now, assume that both extroverts and introverts have an equal amount of good ideas. Who is going to get their way more? Extroverts. This could be dangerous because they’re going to get their way more meaning that many of their bad ideas are also going to be implemented.Oh, another thing I intuitively knew but now have support for is brainstorming sessions. Studies show the larger the number of people involved in a session, the less effective they are. A 9-member group is less effective than a 6-member group which is less than effective than a 4-member group which is less effective than a 2-member group. The suggestion is to conduct brainstorming sessions electronically. Collect comments and then share them anonymously and build from there. One of the reasons is that most introverts are better writers than speakers.Other examples from the business world give tips for how both introverted and extroverted leaders can best work with their subordinates of each type. Take advantage of each of their strengths. Such as how studies show that introverts “inspect” and extroverts “react”. Neither adjective should be taken as derogatory but instead as strengths. Allow introverts time to examine and solve. Studies show they are more persistent trying to solve unsolvable problems. The famous introvert, Albert Einstein said, “It is not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” My hero.A final word on the narration—fantastic. If you have the opportunity to listen rather than read this book, I would strongly recommend going with the audio format. Kathe Mazur does a perfect narration in a “Quiet”, calm, soothing voice. Very appropriate “in a noisy world that can’t stop talking”.!121!As you can see, i've been mixing up my reading lately, THIS ISN'T ROMANCE YAY!Quiet is a fascinating book about the prejudice that our society faces against introverts, and why it's unfounded, and how, as an introvert, you can overcome that, as well as just KNOW yourself better. I never really classified myself as such before, but reading this, I understand why, if I'm exhausted, all I want to be is alone, and how I'm extroverted only when I can control my environment and how that's a THING! If you're shy or are unsure, this is a great read. I think you'll discover something about yourself, that's why I've recommended to a lot of people lately!!121!Shhh, I'm taking some quiet time.Kidding! I'll be honest. I avoided this book the first time it appeared, when the buzz had it popping up all over. But my introversion has been more than a bit disrespected lately and I was feeling a need for some affirmation. Alas, I'm not sure I found much helpful here.Part One is 'The Extrovert Ideal,' and looks at how the change from the 18th century ideal of personality to 20th century cult of personality emphasized extroversion as a valuable workplace trait. I liked the concept of the two, as the cultural evolution from one to the other makes a great deal of sense, but I'm not sure how accurate that may be. I feel like Americans--and perhaps everyone--has always been responsive to extroverted, charismatic people. Actually, that highlights an error in Cain's thinking, that she frequently conflates traits. To give her credit, she admits from the beginning that there is no uniform definition of 'introversion.' At page 11, she finally defines her terms, but she unfortunately tends to define them in terms of examples:""Still, today's psychologist tend to agree on several important points: for example, that introverts and extroverts differ in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well. Introverts feel 'just right' with less stimulation, as when they sip wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or read a book. Extroverts enjoy the extra bang that comes from activities like meeting new people, skiing slippery slopes, and cranking up the stereo.... Many psychologists would also agree that introverts and extroverts work differently. Extroverts tend to tackle assignments quickly. They make fast (sometimes rash) decisions, and are comfortable multitasking and risk-taking... Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. They're relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame.""It's some slippery stuff, because she ends up conflating a number of characteristics, and that's where it can get really fuzzy. This lack of specificity also means relying on anecdotes of how introversion is a helpful trait. Later in the book, she does bring in studies about 'reactivity,' a genetic-based trait that she prefers to call, 'sensitivity.' I've seen the term before, in The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You, and a lot of it comes from research on reactiveness/responsiveness to stimulation and how that is then interpreted. To be sure, it's interesting stuff, but it doesn't necessarily apply to all introverts, as she points out, ""about 70% of sensitive people are [introverts]"" (page 145). After backtracking to explain the evolutionary basis for selection of sensitivity, she then attempts to tie sensitivity and conscientiousness together. It's a thin, tenuous line to get from introverted to evolutionary sensitivity to conscientiousness and then imply that that's the kind of person you want in your company. As singular issues, each of these is well-presented. She usually cites one researcher and gives an example of a famous person who changed the world with this trait (Eleanor Roosevelt represented the introverted, sensitive and conscientious person). But it feels like both sloppy logic and false aggrandizement. As an introvert, I no more want to be 'special' for these qualities that presumably go with my genetic and personality tendencies than I want to be disrespected.For no particularly good reason, except the fact that it described me better than I've ever been described before, I'm actually a fan of the Jungian-based personality assessment. I think I particularly responded to the Jungian analysis because rather than the two-axis basis, there's other traits that also affect how we interact with the world. I actually think there's quite a continuum between introversion and extroversion, and that these tendencies can be modified by learning, as Cain rightly points out in Section Two.So, about Quiet. I don't think it really added anything to my understanding on introversion and extroversion. In fact, I think it fell into a more extroverted (as she would say) analysis of having to prove the worth of the trait and using famous figures to support her examples only added to that perception. Quiet didn't give me the acknowledgement I was looking for, really, just a lot of cheerleading that I'm (still) a good person for being an introvert. Hopefully, for those new to discovering their introversion, this might encourage them to both understand and respect their approach. Just don't look for many tips. Read this book if:1) You suspect/know you are an introvert but feel badly about it2) You are an extrovert who doesn't get why introverts don't just get out more.For a more rigorous analysis, check out Kelly's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...!121!You can also read this review on Flying Kick-a-pow! ReviewsThis is a bit different from what I typically read and review. I don't often read non-fiction, but when my mom got this out of the library and I read the inside flap, I knew I would have to give it a shot. It sounded like something I could relate to and possibly benefit from … and it was. As soon as I started it, I was totally engrossed. And as I made my way through the entire thing, I felt like I was learning more and more about myself.My whole life I've been an introvert. I keep to myself more than the people around me do. I tend to prefer reading/writing to partying. I'm very self-conscious about speaking; when I talk in front of a bunch of unfamiliar people, I stumble over my words and blush and feel like a moron … hence, I usually opt not to speak at all unless someone forces me to and/or speaks to me first.I've grown used to labels like ""shy"" and ""quiet,"" to the rude questions like ""Can you talk?"", ""Do you speak English?"", and ""Have you been in this class the whole year?"" The confrontations and notes from teachers/professors are expected by now. ""You need to speak up more in class,"" ""Don't be shy!"" etc. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to punch a wall. People act as if it's some magical switch I can turn on and off. They think I don't talk much because I'm incompetent, because I'm lazy, because I'm a bitch, because I think I'm better than everyone else. People who know me well can see I'm none of those things (at least, I hope I'm not), but for a lot of people it seems to be a challenge to understand that. It's not that I blame them, because I think it's hard to comprehend what it's like to be an introvert if you haven't experienced it yourself. But still, it's frustrating.What makes being an introvert so hard is that––especially in the US––we are held up to what Susan Cain calls the ""Extrovert Ideal."" That is, we are told our whole lives that the ""ideal"" person is an extrovert––outgoing, confident, well-spoken, etc. Extroverted people are thought of as being more important, more authoritative, and more attractive. If you are a shy, you are more likely to be seen as weak, a pushover, a bad leader, an awkward/unattractive person. We're constantly told that in order to succeed, we need to stand up for ourselves, push others out of the way, be the loudest, take the most risks. If you're a shy/introverted person, you are constantly told that you need to change––that if you continue to be quiet, you're never going to get anywhere in life. You won't get a good job, you won't succeed, no one will want to date you ... you name it. Needless to say, I hate being shy. I'm tired of always being told that I need to speak up more, that I just have to be more confident. It's like, do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I enjoy not being able to say what I want to say, that I feel totally idiotic every time I open my mouth, that I don't even want people to look at me because I'm so self-conscious? Trust me, if I could, I would be more confident. If I could just shut off all the thoughts in my head, I would gladly speak up more often. But I've always felt like my brain just wasn't wired that way. People act as if it's as easy as just speaking up, that the leap from being introverted to being extraverted is as easy as, ""You know what? I'm just not going to be shy today! Yay!""And … yeah. It's not like that at all. It's like, when I'm surrounded by people I don't (or only barely) know, I just go on lockdown. My mind doesn't generate things to say. My mouth refuses to open. I just completely freeze up. And it's not that I don't want to participate in the conversation. I wish talking was easy for me. I do want to contribute. Yet, there's this voice in my head telling me to not say anything, and to just sit back and observe.So, obviously, this is a very frustrating trait to have. It holds me back in a lot of social situations. I have trouble making friends (although I do have friends, so don't worry). I've managed to live for two decades without ever having a boyfriend. My grades have suffered. So on and so forth.I've struggled with this my whole life, I constantly beat myself up about it … I've always wondered what the hell was wrong with me. Why couldn't I just magically gain some confidence? Why couldn't I just suck it up and be a more social person? I've spent my whole life trying to find something to blame, some reason why I've always been like this. Is it because I'm part of a large family, and therefore I've always felt like I should just keep my problems to myself? Is it because I grew up in such an academically competitive town where there was too much pressure to be the star student? Of course, there must be various contributing factors. But according to Cain's book, it may be due more to nature than to nurture than we may think.Cain discusses several studies that relate introversion/extroversion to sensitivity. And apparently, people with more active amygdalae––a part of the brain that plays a significant role in processing memory and emotional reactions––are far more likely to be introverts. People fall roughly into two groups: ""high reactive"" and ""low reactive."" If you are a more high reactive individual, you are more likely to:- React more strongly to stimuli––new sounds, meeting new people, seeing disturbing images, etc.- Be more empathetic towards other people- Be very observational, notice small details- React more emotionally to artwork/music/books/etc.- Be more prone to emotional problems like anxiety/depression- Be very sensitive about what other people think of you, and therefore become timid in social situations where you don't know many peopleThis isn't to say, of course, that more low reactive people don't experience these things, it's just that it tends to happen on a lower scale for them because their amygdalae are not as sensitive. Also, high reactive does not automatically equal introverted and low reactive doesn't automatically equal extroverted, but research suggests a strong correlation between the two traits. But what's most important to realize about levels of reactivity is that they can't be controlled. Cain discusses one study in which infants were tested for how reactive they were to stimuli––and a majority of high-reactive infants grew up to be introverts, while the low-reactive infants tended to grow up to be extroverts. It's studies such as these that suggest we don't choose introversion or extroversion; they are built into our DNA. One can easily fake one or the other. That is, you can be an introvert and still speak a lot and socialize frequently––it's just that, as an introvert, you will be more drained by social interaction. Because introverts are often more high-reactive individuals and therefore react more strongly to stimuli, a room of new faces is much more exhausting to process than it would be for someone who is more low-reactive. I could go on and on about this, but of course––if you want to learn more, I highly suggest reading this book. There's a lot of fascinating information about the subject.Quiet seriously changed the way I think about myself. I still dislike being shy and introverted for many reasons. But after reading this, I also know that I might not have the same creative and observant traits that I have now, if I were extroverted instead. And more importantly, I know that it isn't my fault for being this way––and that millions of people face the same struggle that I do. I don't know if I can say that I really accept who I am, at least not yet. But at least I feel like I understand it a lot better.Over all, I think this book is well-written and well-researched, and Cain narrates it with heart and humor––drawing from her own experience as an introvert alongside her studies of the subject. I thought Quiet was brilliant, and I recommend it to introverts and extroverts alike. ~ Flying Kick-a-pow! Reviews ~!121!Thank you, Susan Cain, for writing this remarkable book! As an introvert who has always been regarded as not only quiet, but also timid and weak, this book is very refreshing. It puts into words what many introverts know intuitively; strength does not have to be loud, in your face, or aggressive. Strength and conviction can present themselves quietly without sacrificing effectiveness. Through impressive research, Ms. Cain clearly demonstrates the importance of both personality types and the value of introversion. I only wish that I could have read this book when I was younger so that I would have been more confident and accepting of my own nature. After reading it now, I do feel that I can better articulate the importance of my role in society and take pride in the contributions that introverts have made throughout history.!121!ive seen this book pop up on my feed quite a bit recently and, even though i read it years ago, i cant believe i never posted a review for it! better late than never. lol. a quick google search will show that anywhere between 25-40% of the worlds population are introverts and i feel so proud to be considered part of such an outstanding group. this book didnt necessarily teach me anything i didnt already know about myself, but it was very neat to see how i can turn my introvertedness into a strength, especially when so many consider a more reserved nature to be a sign of weakness. and because i could relate to literally everything in this book, i have constantly returned to it from time to time over the years, revisiting marked pages, highlights, and notes i made when i first read it.i found this is to be a very informative, eye-opening and thoroughly researched book. its a definite must read for all of my fellow introverts!!↠ 4 stars!121!This book blew my mind. I loved it so much that I wish I could give a copy to all of my friends and relatives.Susan Cain does an excellent job of explaining the different strengths between introverts and extroverts, and the history of how America came to idealize extroverts. I agree that as a society we tend to value the gregarious go-getters, the loud talkers, the forceful presenters. But Cain's book reminds us that societies need introverts, too — the thinkers, the listeners, the people who look before leaping. The long, long, long list of introverts in history includes: Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, George Orwell, Marcel Proust, J. K. Rowling, Lewis Carroll, W. B. Yeats, Warren Buffet, Steve Wozniak, Charles Schultz, Al Gore, Rosa Parks, Gandhi...As an introvert, I found the book comforting and inspiring. But extroverts who are in relationships with introverts or who are parents of an introvert would also do well to read this book. The author has good tips for how to handle introverts, especially children.""Love is essential. Gregariousness is optional ... Use your natural powers -- of persistence, concentration, insight and sensitivity -- to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply. Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it.""Update April 2015I read this book about two years ago, and I think it has been the most influential book I've read in years. Cain's book profoundly changed how I viewed myself, others, and our various roles in society. I have recommended this book to numerous friends, and some of them commented on how grateful they were to have read it. I will add managers and supervisors to the list of people who I think should read this book, because it helps to explain some workplace and group dynamics. While the writing isn't perfect (I remember Cain meanders a bit), I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars because of how powerful and inspirational this book has been.!121!Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is a 2012 Crown publication. I’ve seen Susan Cain’s ‘Ted Talks’, video and knew I would have to read her book, it was just a matter of fitting it into my schedule. As an extreme introvert, this book definitely feels like a form of validation. See? There is nothing wrong with me. There are other people out there just like me, who avoid social situations at all cost, would rather take a good beating than speak publicly, who feel drained after social occasions, and who must have alone time. There are people who, like myself, tried to fake an extrovert personality, but were miserable because it. In a world that is increasingly group oriented, that recognizes the loud, outspoken, forceful personality over the quiet, soft spoken, unassuming temperament, this book is a Godsend. But, while the book explains the tendencies of the introvert and offers some theories on how people develop this type of temperament, and how to cope and compromise in order to fulfill your job duties and family obligations without suffering an overabundance of anxiety or develop depression or a dependence on medication, this book is also a must read for extroverts!Yes, that’s right… extroverts should read this book too, so they can understand that colleague, sibling, or spouse, or child who is quiet, craves alone time, avoids social situations, and would rather not waste time on small talk.  How can employers create a workplace setting that brings out the best of both temperaments? Many people work better and are far more productive when working alone, and have much to contribute, but are often drowned out by the constant cacophony surrounding them. While I agree with nearly everything the author writes, most of the scientific studies and analogies were only moderately interesting and highly debatable. I don’t know if I agreed with all those findings, and this particular section of the books was just a little bit dull. Not everything mentioned here will pertain to every single person who identifies as an introvert. Taking the informal quiz, I answered nearly every question with ‘Yes’, but there were several traits that I do not own, so this is not a ‘one size fits all’ course, and doesn’t try to be, but I think the author covered a tremendous amount of relevant material any introvert can use and relate to. I would not consider this book a ‘self-help’ book, but the author included a few tips and exercises one can use to ease social anxiety and learn to work in groups and speak publicly. There is also a section for parents who may worry about an introverted child, and how to encourage that child, not change them. Overall, I am so happy to see the problems introverts face in an extroverted world, addressed and brought to the forefront. 4 stars!121!Once upon a time there was a woman who dreaded the staff meeting roundtable, when each person had to share what was good or bad or on their professional plate that week or in their personal life. All five, nine, fifteen pairs of eyes would be upon her as she forced her voice to carry down the table, knocking off as few words as she could to express, “Everything’s great!” before turning her flushed face to the colleague beside her. This same woman could take the stage before an audience in the hundreds at a conference and deliver a speech with poise, loving every moment she was in the spotlight. She’d spin around her shopping cart to avoid meeting an acquaintance in the produce department at the grocery store, then host a wine dinner that night for twenty strangers, her joy bubbling as much as the Champagne she poured, explaining to the assembled crowd the difference between méthode traditionelle and transfer method of production. She could spend hours waiting tables at a busy restaurant, engaging in happy grace and good humor with dozens of customers, but the thought of a Friday night party at a friend’s, hanging out in a kitchen drinking beer with a few people from work? She’d feign a sudden flu or a last-minute family obligation to avoid hours of mindless chatter.That I am an introvert is not news to me. I can’t recall when I first took the Myers-Briggs personality type test, but I should have INFJ tattooed on my forehead, for the results never waver. And at some point, I got the message that being an introvert doesn't mean I'm shy, for I am not; it doesn't mean I'm not a risk-taker, for I am, or that I don’t form deep personal attachments, for I have many. What it does mean, among many things, is that socializing wears me out. I abhor chitchat, loud people, group projects and “going out.” It means I love to lose myself in solitary endeavors. It means I love process, not reward. It means I’d rather just sit and listen. And when I have something to say, please be patient. I’m not a fast talker, I pause a lot, searching for just the right word. And even then you’ll probably have to strain to hear me. Unless I’ve thoroughly rehearsed my responses, I’ll never deliver my thoughts with articulate confidence. There are parts of Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking that made me laugh, even as tears stung my eyes. Knowing that I prefer to be alone—that I have little tolerance for casual social situations—never released me from feeling that I needed to overcome my social awkwardness and impatience, my thin skin and tendency to fret about the future and things beyond my control. I thought these were faults, not characteristics of a personality type shared by millions, most of us existing in contemplative, considerate silence. Through research, anecdotal interviews and personal experiences, Cain explores the ways introverted personalities manifest themselves in the workplace and personal relationships. The section on “highly-sensitive” people struck home. 
The highly sensitive tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic. They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions—sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear. They are highly empathetic…with thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world
 Yes, please. Reading this, I realized one of the reasons I tend to shut myself off and away is because I am overwhelmed by my own helplessness to change the world. I take things so personally and feel them so deeply that I become frozen in place, not knowing how to translate feeling into action. When Cain discusses her professional epiphany, I had another laugh/cry moment. Hers was realizing that she was never cut out to be a corporate lawyer; mine, a university and corporate administrator. There are many aspects of our professions in which we excelled, rising quickly through the ranks. But neither of us is cut out for committee work, for schmoozing and glad-handing, for blowing our own horn—all required in legal circles, ivory towers and boardrooms. I loved the one-on-one time I spent counseling students, building relationships with individual faculty, developing administrative processes and procedures, doing research and yes, presenting at conferences and leading workshops, for which I rehearsed and prepared weeks in advance. But I knew I’d never rise to the ranks of the one in charge; I simply wasn’t built for the social demands and networking required of a Director. So, for fifteen years I left job after job just at the pinnacle of power and success—always the Bridesmaid, never the Bride. I never really knew why, except that something was inherently wrong with me. At last, I accept nothing is wrong with me; denying myself the opportunity to advance was recognition that moving up meant moving into roles for which I was constitutionally not suited. Now I am a writer. And a happy little clam. I work to create niches of social balance to avoid complete isolation—I belong to a book club, a writer’s group, I volunteer, meet friends for coffee. Social media is a great release for me, because I only talk when I want to, I have all the time in the world to construct my thoughts (which I can edit later!) and no one is looking at me as I speak. Quiet has given me permission not to regard my limited in-person social circle as evidence of a failure of personality, but as respect given to my true nature: “Love is essential: gregariousness is optional.” In some ways, working through the theories and examples in this book is exhausting and dispiriting—if I’d had a better understanding of how I function best, would I have made different choices? Yet, the most important choices I’ve made—excelling at and loving parts of my profession that I’m built for and not being swayed by extrinsic rewards to pursue paths for which I am not; the dogged determination that puts me in front of a keyboard every day with few indications that I will be able to make a living doing what I love—I’ve stuck to my temperament. My life’s path hasn’t been without its stumbles, but even without knowing quite what makes me tick, I've been true to my nature. This is Cain’s consistent and loudest message, delivered with the gentle power of an introvert. A Manifesto for Introverts (from Quiet)1.	There’s a word for “people who are in their heads too much”: Thinkers.2.	Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.3.	The next generation of quiet kids can and must be raised to know their own strengths.4.	Sometimes it helps to be a pretend extrovert. There will always be time to be quiet later.5.	But in the long run, staying true to your temperament is key to finding work you love and work that matters.6.	One genuine new relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.7.	It’s OK to cross the street to avoid making small talk.8.	“Quiet leadership” is not an oxymoron.9.	Love is essential; gregariousness is optional.10.	“In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” – Mahatma Ghandi!121!Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan CainIn Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در دنیایی که از حرف زدن باز نمی‌ایستد»؛ «سکوت: قدرت درون‌‌گراها در دنیایی که بی‌وقفه حرف می‌زند»؛ «قدرت سکوت: ‏‫قدرت درونگراها در جهانی که قادر نیست از سخن گفتن باز ایستد!»؛ «سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در جهانی که از سخن گفتن نمی‌ایستد!»؛ «سکوت»؛ نویسنده سوزان کین؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه سپتامبر سال2017میلادیعنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در دنیایی که از حرف زدن باز نمی‌ایستد؛ نویسنده سوزان کین؛ مترجمها نرگس جوادیان‌قمی، نعيمه اعتدال‌مهر؛ تهران، انتشارات منظومه نگاران؛ سال1393؛ در292ص؛ شابک9786009433605؛ موضوع درونگرایی و برونگرایی - روابط بین اشخاص، از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21معنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌‌گراها در دنیایی که بی‌وقفه حرف می‌زند؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم: سیمین موحد؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس‏‫، سال1395؛ در366ص؛ شابک9786001821929؛ چاپ دوم سال1396؛ چاپ سوم سال197؛‮‬عنوان: قدرت سکوت: ‏‫قدرت درونگراها در جهانی که قادر نیست از سخن گفتن باز ایستد!؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین‏‫؛ مترجم ناهید سپهرپور؛ ویراستار طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران نوین توسعه؛ سال1395؛ در389ص؛ شابک9786009684311؛ چاپ دوم سال1397؛عنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در جهانی ��ه از سخن گفتن نمی‌ایستد!؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم درسا عظیمی؛ تهران البرز‏‫، سال1393؛ در373ص؛ شابک9789644428982؛ چاپهای دوم و سوم سال1395؛ چاپهای چهارم و پنجم سال1396؛ ‬چاپهای ششم و هفتم سال1397؛عنوان: سکوت؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم: روح‌اله صادقی؛ کرج، در دانش بهمن، سال1395؛ در460ص؛ شابک9789641741978؛ فهرست: «دیدگاه‌هایی پیرامون کتاب قدرت سکوت»؛ «یادداشت نویسنده»؛ «پیش گفتار»؛ «دو قطب شمال و جنوب خلق و خو»؛ بخش اول: برون‌گرای ایده‌آل؛ 1- ظهور «همکار دوست داشتنی توانمند؛ چگونه برون‌گرایی به ایده‌آل فرهنگی تبدیل شد»؛ 2- «افسانه‌ی رهبری کاریزماتیک؛ فرهنگ شخصیت محور، صد سال بعد»؛ 3- «وقتی همکاری خلاقیت را از بین می‌برد؛ ظهور تفکر گروهی جدید و قدرت کار کردن به تنهایی»؛ بخش دوم: بیولوژی شما، خویشتن شما؟ 4- «آیا خلق و خوی ما سرنوشت ماست؟ ذات، تربیت و فرضیه‌ی ارکید»؛ 5- «فراتر از خلق و خو؛ نقش اراده‌ی آزاد (و راز سخنرانی در جمع برای درون‌گراها)»؛ 6- «فرانکلین سیاست‌مدار بود، اما النور براساس وجدان سخن می‌گفت؛ چرا به خونسردها بیش از حد بها داده می‌شود؟»؛ 7- «چرا وال استریت سقوط کرد و وارن بافت ترقی کرد؟ چگونه درون‌گراها و برون‌گراها به نحو متفاوتی می‌اندیشند (و دوپامین تولید می‌کنند)»؛ بخش سوم: آیا همه ‌ی فرهنگ‌ها برون‌گرایی ایده ‌آل را دارند؟ 8- «قدرت نرم؛ آسیایی–آمریکایی‌ها و برون‌گرای ایده‌آل؛ بخش چهارم: چگونه عشق بورزیم، چگونه کار کنیم»؛ 9- «چه زمانی باید خودتان را برون‌گراتر از آنچه واقعاً هستید، نشان دهید؟»؛ 10- «شکاف ارتباطی؛ چگونه با تیپ شخصیتی مخالف خود صحبت کنیم؟»؛ 11- «پینه‌دوزها و ژنرال‌ها؛ چگونه بچه‌های ساکت را در جهانی که نمی‌تواند صدای آن‌ها را بشنود پرورش دهیم؟»؛نتیجه: «سرزمین عجایب»؛ «یادداشتی در وصف فداکاری»؛ «یادداشتی درباره واژه‌های درونگرا و برونگرا»؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 14/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Update: Solid 5 stars..( Jan. 3rd 2016)...I had a reason for a 4.9 rating years ago..I still believe what I wrote ... however..this book is a lifetime favorite book!!!I had a conversation about it just yesterday.I can get very charged up about this book.When I've purged giving books away.. I've always 'kept' this one for myself ( yet I've bought extra copies a few times and have given it as a gift). I feel everyone benefits from this book..'everyone' ... and the process of reading it is a fabulous journey too! Rating: 4.9. Why not a solid 5 star rating? At 'times' I felt the author (an introvert herself), painted a slanted side of the extrovert. [these were just 'small' between-the-line-gut-feelings I felt 'sensitive to']....However:This book is 'excellent'. Its interesting as can be -informative-important- and enjoyable. ...A fast read even 'with' sitting at a table taking notes. (I took 8 long pages of notes)-- it was pure 'joy'....(engaging with this topic). Much to think about, to remember, to discuss. Our book club will talk about this book together Oct. 20th (can't wait). All teachers and parents would benefit from reading this book. *Everyone* would benefit reading this book!I'd suggest this book to EVERYONE!!!!121!This is probably the best book about introverts I have read so far. At the same time, it did not expand my horizons by relating something completely new. As an introvert, I can relate to many things discussed by Susan Cain.Should you read the book if you are an extrovert? I believe, yes. It may help you better understand your friends, colleagues, and people in general as a third to a half of the population are estimated to be introverts. The author seeks to explain what it means to be an introvert in our noisy and fast-paced world. She shares her personal experiences as an introvert and draws on different experiments concerning human psychology and behavior. Susan Cain belies certain biases that surround introverted people in a culture conducive to extroversion. While extroverted people are often noted for their communication skills and charisma, introverts do not have anything against socializing. Introverts, too, like to communicate, often preferring one-on-one conversations, but they need to slow down and recharge after a busy day. While many extroverts thrive on social interactions, introverts get exhausted relatively easily. However, many introverted people excel at listening to others, noticing details, contemplating, and reflecting on what is happening around them. They are more likely to be loyal to their close friends, whereas extroverts often do not search for closeness from their socializing and prioritize small talk.Studies show that introverts prefer single-tasking to multitasking. Extroverts often perform better when they are required to focus on more than one task at a time.According to the author, the main difference between extroverts and introverts concerns the level of outside stimulation they feel comfortable with.Introverted and extroverted people respond to stimulation differently.Most extroverts need large amounts of stimulation to function at their best. Introverts prefer relatively quiet and calm environments.The goal is to find the stimulation level that suits you best. If introverts show better results when working independently or in small groups, this should be taken into account at school and the workplace. The author criticizes noisy and overstimulating classrooms which may impede introverts' productivity and make them feel out of place.People who are considered to have a balance of both introversion and extroversion are called ambiverts. They are probably able to take the best from opposite ends of the spectrum.In certain circumstances, introverts can act like extroverts. They can display traits usually related to extroversion. For instance, introverts can look confident and easy-going when giving public lectures. This self-presentation has its limits, though. The ability to modify our behavior to the social demands of a situation is referred to as self-monitoring. Different people can be more or less effective at self-monitoring. A list of questions (given below) that can help to define our own level of self-monitoring is included. ***If you want to know how strong a self-monitor you are, here are a few questions from Snyder’s Self-Monitoring Scale: When you’re uncertain how to act in a social situation, do you look to the behavior of others for cues?Do you often seek the advice of your friends to choose movies, books, or music?In different situations and with different people, do you often act like very different people?Do you find it easy to imitate other people?Can you look someone in the eye and tell a lie with a straight face if for a right end?Do you ever deceive people by being friendly when really you dislike them?Do you put on a show to impress or entertain people?Do you sometimes appear to others to be experiencing deeper emotions than you actually are? The more times you answered “yes” to these questions, the more of a high self-monitor you are.Now ask yourself these questions: Is your behavior usually an expression of your true inner feelings, attitudes, and beliefs?Do you find that you can only argue for ideas that you already believe?Would you refuse to change your opinions, or the way you do things, in order to please someone else or win their favor?Do you dislike games like charades or improvisational acting?Do you have trouble changing your behavior to suit different people and different situations? The more you tended to answer “yes” to this second set of questions, the more of a low self-monitor you are.!121!Awesome, awesome book! I’ve been sitting on this one since 2014. It’s been off and on my TBR several times over the last 6 years. This year I have read all Net Galley books, Libby books, and read-for-review books. I thought it was time to pick one of the 953 (no kidding—hangs head in shame) e-books sitting on my kindle and this is what I selected. Boy did I get a winner. Go me!OK, so yes, I’m a big introvert. Though this book discusses both introverts and extroverts, there is a bit more emphasis on introverts. Despite that, I think it will be a fascinating read for everyone no matter how you identify.Ms. Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert, has an “insatiable curiosity” for human nature (her words). She is also an acclaimed author, has a Harvard law school degree, and has given innumerable talks (and was terrified before each one). She has won a host of awards. She recorded a smashing TED talk that has been viewed 14 million times and was named by Bill Gates as one of his all-time favorite talks. This book kept me flipping the pages as if it were a Mark Edwards suspense novel. Ms. Cain lays out the results of a number of research studies (NOT boring) and dissects for us the traits of introverts and extroverts and how these traits are perceived by others and can propel one through life. The narrative is full of individual “cases”, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Warren Buffet, and regular people of all ages and how their introvertism has affected their lives. I now understand a lot more about myself and why I feel or think things that I could not understand before. Plus, I feel pretty darn proud to be an introvert. There is SO much more to this book. It is such a compelling treatise that it approaches being a “must read,” in my opinion, for everyone who interacts with other people. Which is, well…. everyone. Oh, and I’m glad this book is on my kindle where it will forever sit as I know I will refer to all my saved highlights time and again.Finally, a special shoutout to Gunjan, whose review finally got me to read this one.!121!Most of this, to be honest, is self-explanatory, but the rest is a fairly comprehensive exploration of how extroversion became a public ideal back in the 1920's, replacing the power of character with personality and the social stigma that has ever since been placed upon people who don't seem vibrant and ebullient. It shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone that 1/3 to 1/2 of all people are introverts, but because we live in a society that places a premium on everything non-introverted, most of us have to fake it to make it, and with that comes exhaustion and misunderstanding, whether with our bosses, our intimates, or with ourselves and our own natures.This book tells us to relax. Be ourselves. Value what you value and understand that some people aren't naturally conflict avoidant, that they like to express anger, surround themselves with a bunch of shallow social jostlers, and that we oughtn't judge our extroverted peers when they jump into decision-making strategies that sink ships and endanger the lives of everyone around them just because they couldn't be bothered to think things through before opening their damn mouths.And please don't judge all the sheep that are impressed by the aggressive blowhards and follow on their every word because they're just so damn charismatic, either.It's okay to think and spend some time alone from others. Really. It might just be the salvation of the world if enough of us just throw off the yoke of social expectations or the stigma of shyness and just get prepared, build up all our talents and reserves in peace, and strike when the time is perfect. We're not unobservant, after all. We just have little patience for bullshit.And even if society has taught us to lie our asses off whenever we're expected to be gregarious and social in all those damn shallow ways that others tell us are the only way to make it in this world, don't despair. The High Social Monitoring we do is a coping mechanism that we've had to develop PRECISELY because we're considered social pariahs. Oh, and GoodReads is a hotbed for a grass-roots introvert revolution. I don't think anyone here will have any real difficulty cultivating contacts and building their networking, because, after all, we're all discussing things that are very important to us and we're diving deep into the material, wallowing in our talents and our passions, and when we rise, And Oh! We will Rise!We will rise like the phoenix from the ashes of social scorn and we will scour the world of all those who would ever deny us our right to sit in silence to read our favorite book or sit in silence to write a chapter in our next brilliant novel.We Will Overcome!(Aside: Some interpretations of this book are mine only and should not be associated with the author.)!121!Quiet entered my life at a particularly low moment. Allow me to set the scene: I had been on vacation for a week and a half. We were in Colorado, visiting my husband's family, some of whom I had met before, others whom I had not. I knew I wasn't going to be entirely comfortable being around people the whole trip- I'm a huge introvert and I'm self aware enough to know that I need downtime, and quite a bit of it, to feel as if I'm functioning normally. But I didn't realize that my husband, who is just as introverted as I am and who I was counting on to help me through all of the introductions, dinners, conversations, etc, was going to immerse himself in Pokemon Go a majority of the time and essentially leave me to my own devices. As Susan Cain would say, he found a ""restorative niche"" for himself in a digital world. It was hard on me as I didn't have that escape.So, here we are, visiting a friend's home and my daughter, who strangely enough is a huge extrovert (the exact opposite of her parents), is struggling. She's tired, out-of-sorts, and throwing a sulk every ten minutes. I'm meeting yet more people, trying to hold trite conversations, and steer my child, all the while just wanting to retreat into a cave and not talk to anyone for a very long time. Honestly, I felt that way before we reached the party, but things seemed to get much, much worse the moment we arrived. It had been building over the course of the vacation, but that day, my internal clamor reached a boiling point. My husband was oblivious to my growing discomfort as he's catching Pokemon, again. (I don't mean to sound bitter here, but I suppose that I am.) I had forced myself for ten days to be social, keep the smile on my face, keep everything flowing smoothly. To my horror, I realize that I am about to have a panic attack in the middle of this crowd of people, more than half of whom I don't even know. I grab my keys and leave.I drive a couple blocks away, castigating myself for not being able to handle it and just pissed because, once again, like many times in my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, I feel like I'm failing at life because I'm not a social butterfly. I can't stand to be around strangers for extended periods of time. I've always been this way- overly sensitive to others, noise, motion, events. I really dislike groups, parties, places where I have to circulate with a bunch of people who don't know me or care about anything that I have to say. The tears fell down my cheeks as I opened up my tablet and began reading this book. And I discovered that about half of all people are just like me. Thank you, Susan Cain. Your book gave me the courage to drive back to my friend's house and face the rest of the evening. I am not a pariah. I am an introvert and perhaps I can do a better job figuring out when I've reached my socializing limits before I meltdown.Many of the positive attributes of introverts which Susan describes, I totally have, I've just never considered them as worth the trade-off of the extroverted personality. I notice small details, have a great memory for conversations and events, long past the time when others forget such things. I think carefully about problems and people, devoting time to taking apart small nuances of books and movies, that other people don't even consider, which makes me a good reviewer of media- perfect for my job as a librarian. Susan nailed my general feeling about myself in the introduction: ""Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we've turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform."" pg 34 ebook. Yes!My role at the reference desk calls for an extroverted personality but I muddle through it, because I care about the job and helping others. Usually, I come home from work, totally worn out and in need of quiet time to unwind. Susan helped me understand that sometimes ""faking it"" is worth it, if it for a cause that means something to you and that others do the exact same thing that I do. Pull out the mask for the job, but then allow yourself the freedom to be who you really are at home: ""According to Free Trait Theory, we are born and culturally endowed with certain personality traits- introversion, for example- but we can and do act out of character in the service of ""core personal projects."" In other words, introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly."" pg 391 ebook.My favorite parts of the book were about sensitivity and social situations. Take this passage: ""...maybe we didn't choose ... social accessories at random. Maybe we've adopted dark glasses, relaxed body language, and alcohol as signifiers precisely because they camouflage signs of a nervous system on overdrive. Sunglasses prevent others from seeing our eyes dilate with surprise or fear; we know from Kagan's work that a relaxed torso is a hallmark of low reactivity; and alcohol removes our inhibitions and lowers our arousal levels. When you go to a football game and someone offers you a beer, says the personality psychologist Brian Little, ""they're really saying hi, have a glass of extroversion."" pg 277 ebook. I may use that in my life. ""Please hand me that glass of extroversion.""I also really enjoyed learning the differences in thinking: ""Introverts and extroverts also direct their attention differently: if you leave them to their own devices, the introverts tend to sit around wondering about things, imagining things, recalling events from their past, and making plans for the future. The extroverts are more likely to focus on what's happening around them. It's as if extroverts are seeing ""what is"" while their introverted peers are asking ""what if.""  pg 323 ebook. Yeah, I do that too.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It saved an evening for me, but more importantly, it changed the way that I view myself. There is power in knowing that you're not alone. Again, thank you, Susan Cain. Some read-alikes: The Introvert's Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World by Sophia Dembling (for introversion) or Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things by Jenny Lawson (for more instances of social anxiety).!121!There's a real pleasure in recognition. Hearing about yourself, finding out you're not alone, it can be a huge relief and release. And so, as a long-time (although fairly gregarious) introvert, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Not much of it was truly surprising, but still, it's nice to read a book that validates the way I tend to operate anyway. Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook!121!This book spoke directly to my soul, to the core of my being.If you’re on this site and reading this, you probably enjoy time alone to read, think and recharge your batteries. It’s not that you’re anti-social, you just prefer having meaningful conversations with one or two people rather than being stuck in a room with a loud group talking about... nothing. Susan Cain’s book will validate you and make you feel you’re not a freak. You don’t need “to come out of your shell.” In fact, there are more of us out there than you’d think. “Introverts” – even the word has negative connotations – make up somewhere between ⅓ and ½ of the population. Cain, who trained as a lawyer but discovered the corporate world wasn’t for her, provides a fascinating look at how current society champions the extrovert ideal. People who speak quickly and loudly (even if they’re not saying much) get praised and promoted. Team-work is encouraged, and there’s no “I” in team, now is there? But introverts, those quiet people who are trying to focus while people are blabbing all around them, have a lot to contribute. Yet they're often ignored.Early sections of the book are devoted to closely examining this extrovert ideal, in a hellishly hilarious Tony Robbins motivation seminar; in the running of a super church; and in studying how Dale Carnegie altered the social landscape with his gung-ho bible How To Win Friends And Influence People.Cain looks at the science of temperament, showing how differences are evident from childbirth – an extended bit about “high and low reactive people” is fascinating. She also shows that introverts might actually be physiologically more “thin-skinned” than extroverts, and how introversion and conscience are connected.Understanding personality types isn’t just theoretical. It has practical applications. Cain suggests how the extroverts in the business world may have caused the 2008 Wall Street crash. And her look at other cultures – Asia, for instance – demonstrates that the extrovert ideal isn’t a universal phenomenon. I found the sections on how introverts learn how to become “fake” extroverts absolutely mind-blowing. There are stories of wildly successful professors and even sales people you’d never classify as introverts but are. I understand this. I think any introvert living in this society has learned, by necessity, how to be more gregarious – through confident voice, posture, attitude – even though it’s not necessarily in his or her nature. I’ve delivered public talks, sat (and talked) on many panels, go to gala openings and for several years had to chat weekly on national TV, always extremely well-prepared (de rigueur for introverts)... but I never really felt or feel completely at ease in these environments. I have to decompress afterwards with close friends. Or go home and read a book.One of the most valuable lessons Cain teaches us is to follow our instincts, especially concerning work and love. To go against our natures could be fatal.Cain also offers up inspiring examples of introverts throughout history: from Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt to Steve Wozniak and Mahatma Gandhi. Each one is instructive and remarkable. The book gets bogged down near the end by illustrations of how introverts and extroverts can get along. And at times there’s a bit of over-compensating rah-rahing for the underdog. But it’s not introvert = good, extrovert = bad, and after all, most of us aren’t exclusively in one camp or the other. (Plus: is an extrovert really going to read something called Quiet?) This is a remarkable book, and essential reading for teachers, employers and parents. And for all of you thoughtful friends and readers on Goodreads.!121!This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Sociology']"
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (Hardcover),Rebecca Skloot,4.11,731069,2010,"Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden quarters for enslaved people, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.","The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog.!121!This is an all-gold ten-star read!It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here.!121!“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store!121!On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells.  Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.Rose Byrne as Rebecca Skloot and Oprah Winfrey as Deborah Lacks in “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” - Credit...Quantrell Colbert/HBOThe author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO film aired on April 22, 2017. It received a 69% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix1/3/23 - Smithsonian Magazine - Henrietta Lacks’ Virginia Hometown Will Build Statue in Her Honor, Replacing Robert E.

A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one.!121!This is a book about Henrietta Lacks, whose cells were taken without her knowledge, which later came to be known as HeLa cells, which is considered as one of the most important landmarks in Cancer research. 






Some interesting topics discussed in this book 

Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1950's 
 Johns Hopkins Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the USA. It was built in 1889 as a charity hospital for the sick and poor in Baltimore. In the 1950s, Hopkins' public wards were filled with patients, most of them blacks and unable to pay their Medical bills. It was the only major hospital of miles that treated black patients like Henrietta Lacks. That was the unfortunate era of Jim Crow when black people showed at white-only hospitals; the staff was likely to send them away even if that meant them to die in the parking lot. Even Hopkins, which did treat black patients, segregated them in colored wards and had colored only fountains. Despite all the severe restrictions and rules imposed by society during that time, we can see from the History that Hopkins did it's best to help treat black patients. In the comforts of the 21st century, we should at least show the courtesy to read the difficult experiences that people like Henrietta Lacks had to go through to make us understand and be grateful for how lucky we are to live during this period.   In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. Board of Education that educational segregation was unconstitutional, bringing to an end the era of ""separate-but-equal"" education.In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which legally ended the segregation that had been institutionalized by Jim Crow laws.And in 1965, the Voting Rights Act halted efforts to keep minorities from voting. The Fair Housing Act of 1968, which ended discrimination in renting and selling homes, followed. Today we can say that Jim Crow laws are at least technically off the books.  Today, I can confidently say that from my own personal experience that Hospitals like Johns Hopkins are able to provide the best care to all irrespective of their race.
A reminder to view Medical Research from a humanitarian angle rather than intellectual angle 
 It is sad to see some Medical Professionals getting too much carried away by the Medical Research's intellectual angle and forget to view it from a Humanitarian angle. We can see multiple examples of it in the life of Henrietta Lacks in this book. It is heartbreaking to read about the barbaric research methods carried out by the Nazi Doctors on many unfortunate human beings. It is hopeful to see that Medical research has progressed a lot from those dark times, giving more importance to the patient's privacy. But, there are still some areas to improve. But we can clearly say that we have improved a lot and are moving in the right direction. 
My favourite lines from this book 
  ""But I tell you one thing, I don't want to be immortal if it means living forever, cause then everybody else just dies and get old in front of you while you stay the same, and that's just sad.""""Henrietta's cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it,"" ""Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are."" 
Verdict 
 5/5.  This is one of the best books out there discussing the pros and cons of Medical research. It clearly shows how one Medical research on one single individual can change the entire course of something remarkable like Cancer research in the best possible way. It also shows how one single Medical research can destroy a whole family. It shows us the importance of making the correct ethical and legal framework to prevent human beings, or their families suffer, like Henrietta Lacks, in the future. It shows us the importance of making the correct ethical and legal framework to prevent human beings, or their families suffer, like Henrietta Lacks, in the future.!121!This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history.!121!Fascinating and Thought-Provoking.
Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants.!121!This is such an important story. HeLa cells were a miracle to humanity and all thanks to Hernietta Lacks and the doctor.It is a must-read.!121!4.5 stars. A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research.!121!My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy.!121!The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?!121!This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out.!121!When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks.!121!The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca SklootThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (2010) is a non-fiction book by American author Rebecca Skloot. Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال2014میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، سال1390؛ در426ص؛ شابک9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال1920م تا سال1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بودند، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را، که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها، به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ و آگر آنها را انباشته کنیم، به بزرگی یکصد برابر ساختمان «امپایر استیت» میشود؛ سلولهای «هلا»، برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها»، و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ»، و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده اند؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان، خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را، پیش روی چشمان و انگشتان خوانشگران میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز، در این کتاب هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار، علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچ ی زندگی «هنریتیا لکس»، به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا»، و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 15/02/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 06/12/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!There are some books that I finish and am left in awe, questioning everything that I thought I knew on a subject. Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at: http://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/!121!Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument.!121!When a poor woman dies of cervical cancer in 1951, her cancerous cells live on. But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now.!121!The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published. It just brings tears of joy to my eyes.http://www.lacksfamily.net/index.phpAnd finally: May 29, 2010A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstonethanks to Dr. Roland Pattillo at Morehouse School of Medicine, who donated a headstone after reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.!121!I finally read it...and all in one day!This is a gripping, moving, and balanced look at the story of the woman behind HeLa cells, which have become critical in medical research over the last half century. Henrietta Lacks had a particularly malignant case of cancer back in the early 1950s. Her cervical tumor grew at an alarming rate and when doctors went to treat it, they took a sample of it. No one could have predicted that those cancer cells would be duplicated into infinity and used for myriad types of testing for many years to come, especially not Henrietta, whose informed consent was not sought for the sampling.Rebecca Skloot became fascinated by the human being behind these important cells and sought to discover and tell Henrietta's story. But first, she had to gain the trust of Henrietta's surviving family, including her children, who were justifiably skeptical about the author's intentions after years of mistreatment. The book that resulted is an interesting blend of Henrietta's story, the journey of her cells in medical testing and her family following her death, and the complex ethical debate surrounding human tissue and whether or not the person to whom that tissue originally belonged to has a say in what's done with it after it's discarded or removed.I can see why this became so popular. The medicine is fascinating, the Lacks family story heartbreaking, and the ethics were intriguing to chew on, even though they could be disturbing to think about at times. I'm glad I finally set aside time to read this one.Click here to hear more of my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive!!121!من هي هنرييتا لاكس؟هنرييتا لاكس هي سيدة أمريكية من أصل أفريقي توفيت عام ١٩٥١ عن عمر يناهز ٣١ عاماً بسبب حالة خبيثة من سرطان عنق الرحم ولكن قبل وفاتها، أخذ جرّاحٌ عيناتٍ من ورمها وأكتشف أن خلاياها لا تموت وأصبحت أول خلايا بشرية خالدة تنمو في المختبر وأطلق عليها خلايا هيلا وهي تعتبر من أهمّ الأشياء التي حدثت للطب في المئة عام الماضية...أعتمدت الكاتبة الأمريكية ربيكا سكلوت عند تأليف هذا الكتاب علي المقابلات التي أجرتها مع عائلة و أصدقاء هنرييتا وكذلك مع العلماء والصحفيين الذين كتبوا عنها كما انها اعتمدت علي مذكرات شخصية لابنة هنرييتا، ديبورا لاكس..الكتاب الصراحة غريب و جاء أقل من توقعاتي وفكرني شوية بكتاب عنايات الزيات لإيمان مرسال بس طبعاً هنا المحتوي أهم وأعمق بكتير..الكاتبة إتكلمت عن هنرييتا بإختصار و معظم الكتاب بتتكلم عن رحلة بحثها علي أفراد العائلة ومحاولة الوصول لهم والحديث معهم...كان واضح جداً إن عائلة هنرييتا لم يحظوا بمعاملة لائقة لدرجة إنهم لم يكن لديهم أدنى فكرة عما حدثَ ويحدث مع خلايا والدتهم وعرفوا عن القصة بعدها ب ٢٠ سنة تقريباً!الكتاب في أجزاء علمية كتير و تسلسل بالتفصيل لما حدث مع خلايا هيلا ولكن الكاتبة أيضاً كانت تلقي اللوم ولو بطريقة غير مباشرة علي العلماء والأطباء الذين استخدموا خلايا هذه السيدة بدون علمها أو حتي علم عائلتها كما إنها بتبين الظلم الذي تعرض له الأفارقة الأمريكيين علي أيدي العاملين في مجال الطب...إستخدمت خلايا هيلا للمساعدة في تطوير لقاح شلل الأطفال كما إنها ساعدت في تطوير أدوية لعلاج الهربس وابيضاض الدم والأنفلونزا والهيموفيليا ومرض باركنس....في النهاية الكتاب مهم بس أعتقد إن الحاجات اللي فعلاً كانت تهمني أعرفها كان ممكن ألاقيها بسهولة من علي جوجل و مكانتش مستاهلة خالص قراءة ٦٠٠ صفحة علي معلومات وحكايات معظمها مش مهمة بالنسبة لي..التقييم نجمتين ولكن بما إني أستفادت وعرفت حاجات جديدة فلازم أرفع التقييم ل ٣ نجوم...!121!This 2010 work of non-fiction regarding THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is a sad story and a tough, draining read that shocked me more than once along the way.Henrietta was a poor black woman only 31 years of age when she died of cervical cancer leaving five children behind, her youngest, Deborah, just a baby. Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better.!121!Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!!121!I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified.!121!I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/!121!I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks!121!This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar.!121!April 22nd will be a film on HBO !!!!121!A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science.!121!What a wonderfully told story. Rebecca Skloot really came through on the research. She dug it alllllll up. And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Audiobook', 'Medical']"
Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Hardcover),Steven D. Levitt,4.01,848403,2005,"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)","This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category.""!121!I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction._________________________[Update, Jun 26 2022]In view of the Supreme Court's recent ruling, I wonder which Republican-led states have started planning for the increased levels of crime that are to be expected fifteen to twenty years from now, and which ones have decided it won't be necessary. In the second case, it would be interesting to know why not. A couple of suggestions to get the ball rolling:a) this is liberal science and can be discounted as political messaging,b) the Rapture will occur first.!121!Sure, this book was a compelling read that offered us all some great amo for cocktail party conversation. But ultimately I think most of what Leavitt claims is crap. He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible.!121!I won't deny that this is a very interesting, compelling and thought-provoking book. Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part.!121!مبدئيا هناك خدعة في عنوان الكتابفالكتاب ليس في الاقتصاد و لكن في علم الاجتماع و لأن المؤلف رجل إقتصاد و لأن الاقتصاد هو أحد فروع علم االإجتماع فقد استخدم ما تعلمه في تحليل بعض الظواهر الاجتماعية بأدوات إقتصادية.مجموعة من المواضيع بعضها شيق جدا و بعضها ممل أو مغرق في المحلية لدرجة لا تجعلنا نتفاعل معه. ما هي الأشياء المشتركة بين معلمى المدارس و مصارعى السومو يبدو سؤالا ساذجا و لكن الإجابة سهلة.هي أسئلة من نوعية ما وجه الشبه بين البطيخ و الموز و تأتى الإجابة بأن كل منهما لا يصلح كعصير برتقال.إجابة السؤال اللوذعى هنا هي أن معلمى المدارس و مصارعى السومو كل منهما يغش في النتائج و ليس هذا هو المقصود بل المقصود هو أنه يمكن كشف هذا الغش بنفس الطريقة و هي طريقة حسابية إحصائية طورها المؤلف و طبقها على أمثلة بالكتاب.من الحكايات الطريفة حكاية عن موظف كان يحضر معه خبز الإفطار و بعض الجبن ليفطر هو و زملاء العمل كل يوم و تطور الموضوع حتى صار يحضر معه الإفطار لكل الشركة ثم استقال و أصبح المسئول عن توريد الخبز لبعض كبرى الشركات حتى أنه كان يوزع حوالى ثمانية آلاف رغيف يوميا.سؤال أخر لوذعى: كيف تتشابه جمعية الكوكلوس كلان مع الوسطاء العقاريين و لمن يعرف فإن جماعة الكوكلوس كلان هي جماعة إرهابية أمريكية نشأت بعد الإتحاد مباشرة و نشطت ضد الأقليات الإسبانية و السود و الكاثوليك و أي شخص غير أبيض أوروبى الأصل بروتستانتى محافظ و يحكى الكاتب عنها حكايات شيقة جدا جديرة بالقراءة.المهم أن وجه الشبه بينهم و بين الوسطاء العقاريين هو استثمار الخوف لدى الخصم و استخدام معلومات لا تملكها لإجبارك على اتخاذ رد فعل في مصلحتهم و يدلل الكاتب على ذلك بعشرات الحكايات اللذيذة جدا.سؤال أخر :  لماذا لا يزال تجار المخدرات يعيشون مع امهاتهم 
برغم أن تجارة المخدرات تدر أموالا طائلة كما نرى في الروايات و الأفلام الا أن الأموال لا توزع على الجميع بعدالة كما يحدث في شركتك تماما. نعم فهى تجارة رأسمالية أيضا.يأخذك الكاتب في جولة غريبة و مثيرة في عالم الجريمة و تجارة المخدرات مطبقا نظرياته العجيبة و احصائياته المثيرة ليدلل على أ�� صغار تجار المخدرات يتمنى أحدهم لو يعمل حارس أمن أو أي عمل أخر لو لم يطمع في الوصول لدور الزعيم و من ثم التنعم بالمزيد من الأموال حتى يقتل أو يقبض عليه.جزء أخر عن علاقة الإجهاض بالجريمة قد لا يكون مقنعا في عالمنا العربى ثم جزء أخير عن العنصرية التي لا تزال بصماتها واضحة و أثارها تنعكس على الواقع الأمريكي حتى الأن.الكتاب مفيد و جيد في معظم أجزائه و أرشحه للقراءة.!121!Jesus H Tittyfucking Christ on a bike! Could these two tossers be any more smarmy and self indulgent? Levitt and Dubner and probably the kind of smart arse nerds who snigger at you because you don't understand linux but sneer at you because you've actually spoken to a woman. This book is much like the Emperor's New Clothes, people are so scared about being left out if they don't like or understand it because some sandal wearing hippy in the Guardian said it's 'This year's Das Capital' or some such bollocks that they feel compelled to join some sort of unspoken club where they all jizz themselves silly over a book that effectively is 300+ pages of pure condescension.Only buy this book if a facist regime ever seizes control of your country and instigates a book burning policy.!121!I guess some people don't like this book because it's not centered around one theme. Instead, it's more about the seemingly diffuse academic work of one of the authors Steven D. Levitt (the other author is a journalist, Stephen J. Dubner). Levitt is something of an economist but more like a social scientist using the tools of Microeconomics applied to other fields that happen to catch his interest (often having something to do with cheating, corruption, crime, etc.). In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)!121!Extremely enlightening! Worthy of 15 stars out of 5! This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)!121!I lost all faith in this book when it tried to teach you how to be a “perfect parent” and came to the conclusion that “it isn’t so much a matter of what you do as a parent; it’s who you are.” He claims that your socioeconomic status determines whether or not you will be a good parent. One of his biggest points in this chapter is that nothing a parent does (for example, taking their child to museums or reading books to their toddler) matters in the slightest. The only data he uses to draw this conclusion is a collection of test scores. Obviously a high test score does not equal a well-raised, happy child in a healthy family environment. And of course what you do as a parent matters. You can’t totally neglect your child and then claim you’re a perfect parent because of your socioeconomic status. You also cannot determine what makes a good parent based on children’s test scores alone. Also, can we talk about how self-congratulatory the author is? It makes the book such a chore to read when he includes things like how he is a demigod of economics or how much he dazzled journalists with his inventiveness and how he revolutionized the field. Freakonomics is disappointing.!121!Freakonomics explores the hidden side of everything. If morality describes the ideal world, then economics describes the actual world. Further, Freakonomics studies incentives and how different people in different professions respond. Some of the case studies include bagel salesmen, sumo wrestlers, public school teachers, crack cocaine dealers and parents. This is a smart, fun book; but it's not for everyone. Through a high nerd prospective, the authors deliver a slide rule and pocket protector observation of some controversial subjects.!121!As the old joke goes, the questions in economics exams are the same every year; only the answers change.(re-reading in prep for the super-freaks)!121!I enjoyed Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner’s Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything; however, I’m not yet sure if it is simply entertaining or is in any way instructive. Levitt and Dubner explore a diverse range of subjects: from linking Roe v. Wade to violent crime, cheating by teachers and sumo wrestlers to an economic model of drug dealing. I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective. Indeed, the focus is interesting. So yes I enjoyed Freakonomics, but feel I should have more to say about it and the authors’ underlying premises than I do. 3.25 stars!121!The Basics:Freakonomics isn’t really about any one thing, which makes it a bit hard to summarize. In essence, it’s economist Steven Levitt playing around with economic principles and basic statistical analysis to examine various cultural trends and phenomena. He tackles a variety of questions, from whether or not sumo wrestlers cheat (they do) to whether or not a child’s name determines his success (it doesn’t). He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated.!121!Yeah, this isn't 'rogue economics'. This is sociology. It's not a new discipline. And this is really spurious sociology that wouldn't pass muster in academia, so Levitt published it for public consumption.!121!Well,this is the most terrible book I have ever seen,it was too terrible to read.It’s so terrible that I just want to burn it as fast as I can,and it cost me 58RMB.That was 58RMB,it was to expensive for me to afford.At first.I thought it was a good book,and I spend all my money on this book.And I was pretty annoyed about this I don’t have any other money for my breakfast,lunch,and even dinner.I haven’t drink juice for the whole year.Reading this is a waste of time,no one want to see this book again.It was just rubbish,and smelly book.It tells my nothing.I even want to sell this to the writer,and ask to return my money and some extra.It cost me too much time,and too much money on it.I prefer to see a movie instead!!!!121!The most interesting part of this book was the introduction. Sad, but true.Four stars for presentation. The prose is nearly invisible, which I suppose in this genre is preferable to the alternative. And the content is mildly interesting, in a ""Huh. Wouldja look at that"" sort of way, as though you saw a duck waddling through your back yard with jam on its head.But insofar as it's meant to be the vehicle for a larger framework for viewing the world, this book is old news. You mean shit's connected in weird, roundabout ways? Get out. Conventional wisdom is often wrong? Superficial analyses are lazy and innacurate? My head...is spinning.Read some good poetry, you hipster fucks.!121!Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics), Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی!121!The book is totally different than ordinary books on this topic. It will bring out those facts that we don't want to eve look or discuss. It has provided many examples with those are unbelievable. It has used to comapre sumo wrestlers and school teachers. IT goona freak you all the time.May the style of the wrtitng book is different but he delivers the information that is valuable to all. It will change the way you think about the modern world.!121!Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent.!121!I am indebted to airport bookstores. And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book.!121!Everything I hate about popular science - alternating between over-simplified, patronising, naive or simply annoying, but worst of all, blatantly refusing to take account of the political and social implications of its findings, and being proud of it.!121!As the tagline goes, ""the hidden side of everything"", this book explores the mundane yet devious plots in our everyday lives. It makes random reflections on random subjects, and in turn, upends conventional wisdom rather than reinforcing them. The book offers profound insights on informational advantage, that is enjoyed by people from (nearly) all walks of life. A simple unasked question, and there you go! This is where the exploration begins and it is an efficacious way to demolish the widespread fallacies. All in all, this book addresses that things are not always what they seem and there lies something under the surface, which, more often than not, does not come to limelight. It is only when we do not embrace faulty causes at the urging of the experts in which they have a vested interest, and deep dive into the rudimentary aspects of a subject, that its veracity would be divulged.!121!I assumed Freakonomics would be a book that used statistics to debunk various societal hysterias and fearmongering in a semi-humorous way. I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage.!121!I found this book to be really fascinating. Chapter 3- Why do drug dealers still live with their moms, was very illuminating. I like the questions they posed and the connections they came up with. I was quite surprised about the American school system, especially the fact that teachers often used cheating methods to make sure their students scored well in standardized tests.The section about how given names may influence one's future was quite gloomy in some ways, especially as there's evidence that we are judged based on our names, not on our abilities. All in all, a lot of great information.!121!This is a very American book. Not just because all of the examples in it are set in the US, but also the hype about it is terribly American too. It has the tone of self congratulation that has sold a million self-help books. Which is a pity, as what it has to say is terribly interesting and amusing.The stuff at the end about how the name you are born with affects your life is very interesting. Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation.!121!Verbose, repetitive, contradictory: a book of 200-pages that could be condensed to 3-5 pages. Titles that vary from scintillating to insulting, yet are followed by a chapter that doesn't support the title bar. Anecdotal stories, mistaken for data or hypothesis. Interpretations and hypotheses are drawn from data that could still be interpreted in multiple ways.The book claims that it will link the unexpected, but frankly, links the obvious, with many ""well duh"" moments.Needless generations of lists that help bulk out the book, but provide little further benefit for study.Each chapter begins with unnecessary aggrandisement of the author for the statistician, that jars the flow of the book.Overall, a good demonstration of why ""social sciences"" are in no way close to being ""science"", and instead should be termed social philosophy.!121!کتاب اقتصاد ناهنجاری های پنهان اجتماعی نوشته استیون لویت به بیان خود نویسنده کتابی ایست که موضوع واحدی ندارد ، و اثر و اصولا ادعایی هم در بهبود کیفیت زندگی مادی انسان ندارد ، اساس کتاب او بر مبنای شک است . آنچه نویسنده به دنبال آن بوده است پیدا کردن رشته ای مشترک در کاربردهای امور روزمره است ، این که مردم در دنیای واقعی چگونه رفتار می کنند ، مساله ای مهم که آقای لویت تلاش کرده با تلفیقی از علم اقتصاد ، آمار ، جامعه شناسی و رفتار شناسی به آن پی ببرد . هدف نویسنده در زیر سوال بردن عقل متعارف است ، پرسیدن سوال های بسیار تا هر فرد برای هر موضوعی با تکیه بر هوش و شناخت خود به ایده یا راه حلی برای آن برسد .اگرچه بیشتر موضوعاتی که استیون لویت به آن ها پرداخته اصل و ریشه غربی دارد و برای مردم در جوامع شرق ممکن است کمی عجیب به نظر برسد اما کتاب در مجموع در تلاش برای نگریستن متفاوت و خارج از عقل متعارف برای خواننده فارغ از هر جامعه یا ملیتی ، نسبتا موفق بوده است .!121!The ""experts are evil, have agendas, will trick you"" talk got old real fast, especially when points are later being backed up with experts research. There's not enough discussion on the data itself, no distinction between quantitative and qualitative, and not enough discussion on the many flaws of data and how we analyze it. Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.!121!I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves.!121!Levitt and Dubner's ground breaking look at the world through the eyes of collated data that tells a story in itself, like their shocking discovery of what caused a huge drop in crime in America in the 1990s. Reading this a decade on I still find this so absorbing and interesting which is just as much as a result of their writing style as their great content.[image error]Just remember assume nothing... question everything! 8 out of 12.","['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Finance']"
Outliers: The Story of Success (Hardcover),Malcolm Gladwell,4.19,781009,2008,"Learn what sets high achievers apart — from Bill Gates to the Beatles — in this #1 bestseller from ""a singular talent"" (New York Times Book Review).In this stunning book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers""—the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.","Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better."" While I can see a different way of spinning the data provided to support Gladwell's argument, I didn't care. In a rare moment, I found myself not wanting to argue. : ) Instead, I found myself reflecting on things that have felt like lucky opportunities in my own life. This reflection was very humbling. Moreover, I felt the text tugging at the need for greater equity. What could all the people with limited opportunities do if given greater opportunities? Think Darfur. How many people who might have come up with the cure for pancreatic cancer been forced to spend their time standing in lines waiting for clean water or food? My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis. Many of my refugee students are pre-literate. They have not been given the opportunity to gain a formal education. As a result, there are many well-intended, but misinformed people who place these students in special education courses or deem their I.Q. low, diminishing their opportunities even more. The students I teach are hungry for skills and spend hours outside of class practicing. They make huge gains despite earlier opportunities denied them. While many will not go on to big colleges out of high school, I feel like given enough opportunity and time they could make it there. Sadly, many have families who depend on them to work to help financially support the family. (Yet, another limited opportunity to spend time focused on developing skills.) In the past week, I have shared Gladwell's thesis with my students. We have applied the 10,000 hours to master a task to reading and writing. I remind students that if we don't get our 10,000 hours this year together, they must continue on their own. I remind them that it IS possible to move forward if they are focused and keep adding hours of work to their reading and writing. We even write on the board how many hours left before we are masters. ""2 hours down, only 9,998 left to go.""Friday, I had a student from Somalia smile and ask, ""So it's not true that white people are smarter than black Africans? They just get more chances to read?"" Imagine my pleasure when I could respond, ""YES! That's correct. You are just as smart as any white kid in this school. It's just that some of them have been reading for years and you are just getting started."" Thank you for your work Galdwell, it is salient in today's political conversation surrounding education (especially for our most vulnerable students who have been given the fewest opportunities).!121!When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye."" At first glance, his work seems thoroughly researched, even visionary at times. Beginning with a few maverick, counter-intuitive insights, he often ends with an affirmation of consensus, but it is a consensus that has been broadened by investigation and enriched by nuance.On second look, however, I'm no longer sure any of this is true. What first appeared to be new insights are nothing but familiar landmarks, previously unrecognizable because of the adoption of a deliberately mannered perspective; even the once apparent breadth and nuance now seem triumphs of language over logic, the apparent inevitability of his arguments an illusion conjured by the spell of his limpid prose.Take one small example from ""Outliers."" With a flurry of standardized test statistics, Gladwell makes the case that the traditional summer vacation--however rewarding it may be for the middle class--is just not working for the poor. (I'll concede the point, for the sake of argument, but any high school teacher will tell you how suspect conclusions drawn from such statistics can be.) He then presents a sustained anecdote about a successful all-year-round secondary school in a poor neighborhood. His conclusion? We should go to school year round. Sounds reasonable, right? But what about a more obvious solution: as a society we could decide to work together so that summer can be a learning experience for the poor by instituting a myriad of basketball camps, music camps, art camps, chess camps, traditional summer camps, etc., held at schools, community centers, and city parks, and staffed by college students, artists and teachers from the neighborhood. Gladwell often reminds me of the last panel of a Dilbert cartoon: two panels of plain-speaking criticism, followed by one panel of resignation. And no real insight, no real hope for the future.!121!I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.There are a number of ways I can tell a book will be good; one of those ways is if Graham has recommended it to me (how am I going to cope without our lunches together, mate?). And there is basically one way for me to I know that I’ve really enjoyed a book, and that is if I keep telling people about it over and over again. Well, not since Predictably Irrational  (also recommended to me by Graham) have I gone on and on about a book to people. First to Ruth over lunch, then to mum on the phone, and then the kids after they had just gotten out of bed in the early hours of the afternoon – my poor children, I’ve told them virtually the entire book.Now it is your turn.As a culture we tend to believe that people who are successful (people like Mozart, Bill Gates, The Beatles) all are ‘self-made-men’ and have risen to the summit of achievement on the basis of some incredibly special power they have and that we do not. It is a comforting thought, in some ways. If we have not done as well we are hardly to blame, because we just didn’t have that certain something. We don’t have the thing that sets them people apart from the crowd. And in this cult of celebrity we even get a chance to live vicariously in the reflection of their glory. Perhaps we can never all be Lady Di, (at least, not in public) but we can all attempt suicide with a pate knife and get into colonic irrigation. John Safran talks somewhere about a guy he knows saying to him that the only reason John made it and he didn’t was because John was Jewish. John then talks about how much hard work he had to put in to becoming successful, none of which relied on the mythical leg up he would have gotten from some secret Jewish conspiracy. This book isn’t about Lady Di, but it is about a series of biographies of people who have become incredibly successful. The biographies are generally told twice. The first time in a way that confirms all our prejudices about self made men and then in a way that makes sense of the success in ways we may find much more uncomfortable. I really struggled with this book – I loved every minute of it, but I still felt remarkably challenged by it. It was very hard not to think of my own life while reading this book. And this did not make me feel comfortable.I guess we are all fairly predictable, and one of the things that makes us especially predictable is that we generally like to have our prejudices confirmed. We buy books that tell us over and over again what we already know and believe. The Left Behind series is just one such example, as are most self help books. And I’m as guilty of this as anyone else. But there is a much better sensation we can get from a book, although this is much more rare. It is when the person you are reading starts telling you the deeper reasons why your beliefs are valid and not just based on prejudice. I have always believed talent is another (although, less apparent and all too vague) word for hard work. I’ve also believed that we are products of a range of different variables too complex to know in any real detail. This book confirms those prejudices.First he talks about ice hockey and a fascinating fact about the birthdays of the best players. They are all born at around the same time of the year. It is as if there is a cut off date for when you will be a professional ice hockey player – and, in fact, there is. The short version is that if you are born on the wrong side of the date they use to group kids into age levels you are likely to be a year younger than the other kids you are playing ice hockey with and therefore a year smaller than them too. That is going to make them look like they are better players than you are – and they will be too. A year at 10 is a huge difference, a huge advantage. And then we compound that advantage, by giving the older kids more practice, more experience in games and then more experience and more practice until there is no way the kid who happened to be born on the wrong side of the cut off date has any chance of catching up.The point he makes strongly here and repeatedly in the first part of the book is that there are other factors to success that are more than just ‘natural ability’. In fact, he does not believe in ‘natural ability’ – only in effort and time. Essentially he shows that if you put in 10,000 hours on any task you will be highly proficient at that task. Innate ability does not exist and ability is actually a function of effort expended. This is both liberating and incredibly challenging. Liberating because success is related to the effort you put in (and I think you should believe that is true even if it isn’t – it is the myth of Sisyphus, the only way we can really cope with the world is to believe our efforts have meaning). Challenging, because ultimately we are responsible for our own success as we are directly responsible for how much effort we are prepared to put in.The second great theme of this book is that where you come from matters. The culture that we are from has a remarkable impact on the rest of our lives. For example, if you are from a working class background you are much less likely to approach life with an attitude of ‘entitlement’. When people in authority speak to you, you are probably less likely to question them. In fact, you might believe you should defer to them. You are probably more likely to believe rules exist for a reason and that rules can’t be changed and can’t be moved. People from the middle class are much more likely to see rules as things that can be shaped or changed or ignored to make their life more easy or rewarding. Having come from the working class, even a particularly radical end of it, I can still see aspects of this deference in my own character and this was perhaps the most challenging part of the book for me.The other challenging bit was the part about the Hatfields and McCoys. As a Northern Irish boy, even if I’m not as obsessed with ‘honour’ as I might have been, this does make sense of things I have wondered about for a long time. The solution might be a little too neat, but the Irish, particularly the Northern Irish, are far too likely to feuds that are intractable and recognising that that might have cultural roots beyond the excuse of religion is utterly fascinating to me.The lessons of this book can be put into a brief sentence: success depends on a series of cultural and other factors that are mostly beyond your control – however, the thing that is totally within your control about success is how much effort you put in. And the more effort you put in the more likely you will be successful. They are directly proportional and we should all praise work as the key thing that really makes us human.I loved this book. I noticed that Ginnie points to a pilot who disputes some of what Gladwell says about culture and plane crashes, but this is a minor point. His bigger point about culture and plane crashes still stands and is remarkable. If you have kids, read this book – it will give you hints on how to bring them up with perhaps a modest sense of entitlement – it could make all of the difference. Ginnie also has a link to an article with a photo of the man himself – I was saying to the kids yesterday that I would give a couple of toes to look nearly as cool as he does, but I think it would take more than just toes.Look, what can I say? Read this book, it is life altering. Well, maybe not life altering, but a delight nonetheless.!121!Didn't exactly read this book - Joe and I listened to it in the car on the way home from visiting family for Christmas. I really enjoyed it, and was very fascinated by certain parts of it, especially the sections about the Beatles, computer programmers and Korean co-pilots.But my enjoyment of the book was marred by the glaring absence of any well-known female ""outliers."" By chapter four or so, I noticed it and mentioned it to Joe, and then it just kept getting worse to the point that it was comical and distracting. Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem. By the time we got to that vignette, it was so ridiculous that Joe and I both started laughing, and Joe joked that ""the only woman in the book is dumb - but persistent.""When we got home, I Googled ""Gladwell Outliers sexist"" or something like that and found that several female bloggers and columnists also were ticked off about it and had taken Gladwell to task for it. Gladwell doesn't strike me as a raging sexist, so my guess is that he is so used to being a male in this world and constantly hearing about and identifying with male high achievers that maybe he didn't even realize what he was doing. I noticed that he gave a pretty weak response when questioned in an interview about his omission of women - he claimed that he had not omitted women because he mentioned his grandmother's story at the end of the book, in the epilogue, I think. Um, okay.!121!Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration. Plus, he's obsessed with callbacks and summary statements that only showcase the faulty connections between ideas.!121!The Banality of Neoliberalism...1) Sloppy methodology: --Let's take a gentle start. Even a lottery has real people winning it. If your methodology is to only examine the winners (and bypass the structure of the lottery system), then you can surely come up with some highly entertaining (and biased) results!--The whole point of study designs/methodologies and statistics is to analyze the chaotic noise of the real world without getting distracted by certain human heuristics/biases (this does not mean we can avoid morals/politics, more later); see Ben Goldacre:-I Think You'll Find It's a Bit More Complicated Than That-Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks...In fact, Goldacre has a couple words on Gladwell: On my left shoulder there is an angel. She says it's risky to extrapolate from rarefied laboratory conditions to the real world. She says that publication bias in this field [psychology] is extensive, so whenever researches get negative findings, they're probably left unpublished in a desk drawer. And she says it's uncommon to see a genuinely systematic review of the literature on these topics, so you rarely get to see all the conflicting research in one place. My angel has read the books of Malcolm Gladwell, and she finds them to be silly and overstated.--Here's a revealing interview of Gladwell as a salesperson rather than a serious social theorist, study design be damned (emphases added; source: https://www.avclub.com/malcolm-gladwe... ): The A.V. Club: Your books all focus on singularities—in The Tipping Point, singular events, in Blink, singular moments, and in Outliers, singular people. Was there a single instance in your life that made you start seeing the world in terms of single points?Malcolm Gladwell: I just think I'm attracted to those kinds of singular things because they always make the best stories. I'm in the storytelling business, and so you're always drawn to the unusual. And early on, I discovered that's the easiest way to tell stories, so I've stuck with it ever since. And if you come up through a newspaper as I did, your whole goal is to get a story on the front page, and you only get something on the front page if it's unusual, so you're quickly weaned off the notion that you should be interested in the mundane. ...My definition of ""mundane"" (banality) features salespeople (con artists?) pretending to popularize social theory while actually just selling quirky stories that conveniently re-enforce status quo myths. 2) A First-World, Middle-Class Fantasy:--""John Steinbeck once said that socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" -Ronald Wright--Onto morals/politics: the real-world lottery system, with its violent conquests, inherited wealth, abstract contradictions and social struggles are whitewashed into a bland, apolitical marketplace composed of competitive automatons each trying to maximize their personal gains/utility, culminating in a meritocracy. --On this edifice, we see the heaps of First-World glossy-covered self-help (The 4-Hour Workweek), pop-psy, pop-econ (Freakonomics), and business books to make the target audience feel more professional/self-accomplished. --Of course, this system (capitalism, state capitalism, neoliberalism, whatever you want to call it) has to work for some given its ceaseless mobilization of wage labour generating tremendous surpluses to extract from. The question is to what degree competition and meritocracy exist (not to mention the perverse consequences, let alone alternatives). --Gladwell's storytelling features some highly political figures (Gates/Skadden/Oppenheimer); we have firmly stepped outside of cute marketing gimmicks and quirky entertainment/sports stats...--Sterilizing the politics from the story requires limiting the scope of analysis to make meritocracy (""10,000-Hour Rule"" to gain world-class expertise) more plausible. This requires skimming off undeserving peoples, usually starting with a national/colonial bias (by assuming the US/First World) and then certain classes/social groups. --However, the system of capitalism is global; that was the whole point of colonialism, the slave market, the ""coolie"" market that replaced slavery, and today's transnational corporations and institutions (World Trade Organization, World Bank, IMF) backed by the US military to maintain capitalism's imperialism. Many poor countries are perfectly embedded into global capitalism, being the most ""open for business"" for transnational corporations their resources, dump their pollution, and (crucially) prevent alternatives (""Red Scare"", ""War on Terror"", etc.): The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions...Global capitalism features social dislocation, be it:i) Booms of financial speculation/gentrification (And the Weak Suffer What They Must? Europe's Crisis and America's Economic Future) and jobless growth (Capitalism: A Ghost Story), or ii) Busts leaving behind rust belts and mega slums (Planet of Slums). ...Thus, there's always enough dispossessed poor people to exploit (tens of millions of preventable deaths each year under global capitalism is somehow normalized), just as there's always enough environment to exploit (well, until that collapses: Facing the Anthropocene: Fossil Capitalism and the Crisis of the Earth System).--Curiously, the US (in particular the book's ""middle class"" target audience) is more and more experiencing the spatial (global) and temporal (boom/bust cycles) nature of capitalism that have ravaged the Global South. --The most destructive war in human history (WWII) was the ""creative destruction"" that saved global capitalism from the endless Great Depression, with the US as chief creditor/arms dealer. The post-WWII boom built the US ""middle class"" with the US as the factory of the world; this lasted only decades before it collapsed under contradictions (Super Imperialism: The Origin and Fundamentals of U.S. World Dominance). --The US's next ""creative destruction"" was to smash its unions and factories (outsourcing) to unleash Wall Street's Finance Capitalism, resulting in the past 40+ years of global booms/busts while parts of the US were left with Rust Belt deindustrialization, opioid crises, precarious work, mass homelessness and uninsured, etc. --Without a clear understanding of the profit-seeking spatial/temporal logic and disruptions of global capitalism (indeed abstract, where long-term power hides), those disillusioned with the status quo are susceptible to scapegoating, symptomatic explanations targeting the visibly-different and vulnerable. Hence, ""global Trumpism"" repeating the history of fascism which arose during the Great Depression.

Whether the book is a mere fluff piece or something more is open to debate. At its heart, it has two themes: (1) That success depends not just on talent but opportunity, and (2) that success (and failure) also depend on the cultural legacies we inherit from our forebears. Boiled down, here are his essential ideas:OPPORTUNITY1. Luck matters. Hockey players who happened to be born between January and March were disproportionately represented in professional hockey leagues. From an early age, these players were the oldest in their age bracket, and therefore bigger and more coordinated. Coaches selected them for better training and playing opportunities, and overtime, success bred success. Likewise, students who happened to be older for their class scored higher on math and science tests than their younger classmates, and were more likely to be picked for ""gifted"" and other advanced programs. 2. Even smart people need 10,000 hours of practice before they master a skill. Those that can get those 10,000 hours during childhood are a step ahead. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and The Beatles all had unique opportunities to have lots and lots of practice in their specialties at an early age before becoming successful.3. After 120, increases in IQ are less important than creativity and ""practical intelligence"" -- knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect. A lifelong study of geniuses showed they were no more successful than the average population. Nobel laureates are just as likely to come from City College of NY, Augsburg College, or Gettysburg College as they are from Harvard.LEGACY4. Rural Americans in backcountry states -- Kentucky, Tennessee, North & South Carolina -- inherited a ""culture of honor"" from their Scotch-Irish forefathers. These herdsmen warriors brought with them a willingness to fight in response to the smallest slight. This led to a pattern of bloody and violent feuds between families across the Appalachian states. (Think Hatfields vs. McCoys.)5. Korean Airlines had an unusually high rate of plane crashes because of the Korean culture's extreme deference to superiors. Junior pilots were reluctant to directly contradict their Captain on a flight, even in the face of grave error. This explains, for instance, the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam in 1997. When the airline hired a specialist from Delta to retrain the pilots to speak more transparently, their safety record went up dramatically.6. Asians are good at math and science because their ancestors planted rice paddies. Rice farming was more labor intensive than Western agriculture. Asians have inherited this stick-with-it-ness that allows them to excel in math and science, where perseverance is mandatory.7. Unlike rice paddies, wheat or corn fields need to be left fallow every few years. Early American educators adopted this principle toward schooling - that students must not be exhausted. Hence, the long summer vacation, a distinctly American legacy. But this legacy is counterproductive, because kids tend to forget things over the summer. Kids who go to schools with shorter summer breaks tend to have higher test scores.!121!I can save you the trouble of reading the book: smart people don't automatically become successful, they do so because they got lucky. This rule applies to everyone including the likes of Bill Gates and Robert Oppenheimer. That's it. That's what the whole book is about. Gladwell looks at case after case of this: Canadian hockey players, Korean airline pilots, poor kids in the Bronx, Jewish lawyers, etc... Even with all this evidence it feels like he's pulling in examples that fit his theory and ignoring others. Thus while we look at many examples of geniuses who got lucky we do not look at Einstein which seems strange as he's the best known genius of the 20th century. While the book can be summarized in one sentence, the individual chapters are interesting such as the chapter that discusses a plane crash that happened in New York because the pilots were too subservient to make it clear to the air traffic controllers that they were almost out of gas. In short, the parts of this book were more interesting then the whole.!121!Outliers : the story of success, Malcolm Gladwell Outliers has been described as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers""--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «تافته های جدا بافته: داستان موفقیت»؛ «نخبگان چگونه نخبه میشوند»؛ «استثنایی ها: داستان موفقیت»؛ «قصه آدمهای استثنایی: توفیق از نگاهی دیگر»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوا��ش: پانزدهم ماه سپتامبر سال2010میلادیعنوان: تافته های جدا بافته: داستان موفقیت؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: میترا معتضد؛ تهران، نشر البرز، سال1388؛ چاپ دوم سال1389؛ در325ص؛ شابک9789644426797؛ موضوع: مهارتای کلیدی در کسب و کار و زندگی - موفقیت - مردمان موفق از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده21معنوان: نخبگان چگونه نخبه میشوند؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: فرناز عسکری؛ فائزه عسکری؛ تهران، نشر سبزان، سال1389؛ در160ص؛ شابک9786005033984؛ چاپ دوم سال1389؛ چاپ سوم سال1393؛ عنوان: استثنایی ها: داستان موفقیت؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: محمدعلی سروری؛ تهران، نشر جمهوری، سال1389؛ در328ص؛ شابک9786005687170؛ عنوان: تافته جدا بافته: داستان موفقیت؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: سپیده علی کاشانی؛ تهران، نشر آنیسا، سال1393؛ در251ص؛ شابک9786009481408؛ عنوان: قصه آدمهای استثنایی: توفیق از نگاهی دیگر؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: شهرزاد بیات موحد؛ کرج، نشر دُرَ دانش بهمن، سال1393؛ در305ص؛ شابک9789641740698؛بررسی زندگی غولهای تجارت، نابغه های علمی، ستارگان ورزشی، و موسیقیدانها؛ و اینکه آنها چه وجوه اشتراکی با هم دارند؛ به فراسوی نتایج چشمگیر، اسطوره ها و افسانه ها مینگرد، تا معلوم کند چه توضیح درستی برای اشخاص بسیار موفق وجود دارد؛ به پرسشهای زیر پاسخ میدهدضریب هوشی شما چه ربطی با میزان حقوقتان دارد؟ یک زبانشناس دربارة ایمنی خطوط هوایی چه چیزهایی میتواند به ما بگوید؟ طرز صحبت فرزند شما با یک بزرگسال چگونه بر موفقیت آنها در زندگی تاثیر میگذارد؟ شالیزارها چه ربطی به تبحر ریاضی دارند؟ و شما چگونه میتوانید یک فرد با استعداد و درخشان در ریاضی را بدون گرفتن آزمون شناسایی کنید؟ عنوانهای مطالب کتاب: «مقدمه: راز رزه‌تو»؛ «فصل اول: اثر متیو»؛ «فصل دوم: قانون10000ثانیه»؛ «فصل سوم: مشکل نابغه‌ها، قسمت اول»؛ «فصل چهارم:مشکل نابغه‌ها، قسمت دوم»؛ «فصل پنجم: سه درس از جو فلوم»؛ «فصل ششم: هارلن، کنتاکی»؛ «فصل هفتم: نظریه‌ قومی سقوط هواپیماها»؛ «فصل هشتم: شالیزارهای برنج و آزمون‌های ریاضی»؛ «فصل نهم: معامله ماریتا»؛ «فصل دهم: سخن آخر، یک داستان جامائیکایی»؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Malcolm Gladwell writes very interesting and entertaining books. J.R.R. Tolkein writes very interesting and entertaining books as well. However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along the lines of New Yorker or Vanity Fair  articles. However, their connection with reality is highly, highly dubious.This book is a big disappointment after ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"", both interesting books that don't have the reader arguing with the author the entire way through. One main problem is that there isn't really an identifiable thesis in the book. It seems like Gladwell wants to say that the myth of the ""self-made"" person is not true, since every successful person has had help and lucky breaks along the way. Well, duh! But then he goes on to say that successful people spend 10,000 hours on their chosen area of success. Do they get any credit for that? Does working on something for 10,000 hours when you could be goofing off make you a bit ""self-made""? In my book it certainly does.Take Bill Gates. Yes, he came from a rich family, had some breaks and some unique opportunities. But what about his former classmates who are now meth addicts or bitter failures who had similar opportunities, but didn't sieze them? Or those who simply were too lazy to put in 10,000 hours in front of the computer? Is Gates ""lucky"" that he had the drive to do that? So either the main thesis falls apart -- that if you are privileged and lucky you will be successful, or it becomes something completely prosaic, such as ""Gates worked hard, but he had some unique breaks"". Again, duh! That's life. Every person can identify positives and negatives in their own lives. It is the choice to overcome the negatives and to capitalize on the positives that makes the difference. If Gates hadn't found the computer lab Gladwell discusses, would he have just given up, or would he have kept on looking? I think that he would have kept looking until he found a similar opportunity.The science is also incredibly flimsy. He asserts - ""Successful hockey players are almost all born in January - March"". Well, wouldn't that apply to all athletes? Wouldn't somebody before Gladwell have figured that out? Where is the data from the NBA, NHL, NFL and MLB? It really is an example of inductive reasoning, not good science. Gladwell is made aware of a pattern with *certain* hockey teams in Canada, and then assumes that this small sample proves that if you are born in April or after, you won't become a good athlete. Maybe so, but Gladwell needs more data to prove his point.Another assertion is: ""Asians are good at math because their ancestors were rice farmers - They come from a patient, hard-working culture"". But perhaps there are other reasons that could explain the same thing: religious traditions, government, how education is structured. Hey, maybe Asians have a high tolerance for their own body odor and can spend more hours in the field than Europeans! I'm not seriously arguing that, but it is an example of Gladwell making a connection between two things that is far from proven.The book is best read as a series of colorful essays on some interesting topics. However, as a guide or explanation of success, it is an example of truly sloppy science and shoddy reasoning. True, successful people don't get there on their own. But everyone can review their lives and identify lucky breaks as well as unfair disadvantages. In the end, Gladwell doesn't explain success at all in a convincing fashion, and risks leaving the reader with the impression that fatalism is the only attitude to have towards their own success. Nothing could be further from the truth.!121!""This is not a book about tall trees. It's a book about forests.""""Why are manhole covers round?""This is my second Gladwell book - The Tipping Point being first - and after reading it, I'm still a little confused what to make of it. I originally thought this to be a self-improvement kind of book, but quickly figured that's not the case, then may be some sort of a business development one, which also fell apart quickly. I cannot round off this any closer than to some kind of a sociology - psychology combo.""the teachers are confusing maturity with ability.""""We prematurely write off people as failures.""I have to confess first, that I started reading this book with a lot of skepticism, mainly because of Peter Thiel's Zero to One. I liked that book a lot, and out of nowhere, Thiel attacks Gladwell in his book for being a negative influence on readers. But after reading the entire book now, I'm don't believe Thiel's criticisms are fully justified. Being said that, some of the concepts in outliers like 10,000 hour rule, though explained in a very clear and attractive manner, still seems a little bit out there. It's true that we are naturally reluctant to accept that certain unchangeable parameters in life to have any significant meaning towards our successes and failures in life, such as the birth month. It's kind of confusing how that kind of information suppose to help a person, unless of course the reader is purely interested in understanding such limitations and just accept them. This could indeed create a negative spiral of events, if someone embraces these limitations and give up on everything.""Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.""Still, I have to give credit for how interestingly Gladwell interprets everything. If this is the first non-fiction or self-help book someone reads, it's easy to imagine that reader becoming a lifetime fan of Gladwell, for everything is laid out perfectly, in that unique Gladwell style. But read it with an open mind, and a tiny bit of skepticism, and you will come across some interesting interpretations of certain events. And finally, as to the concepts of outliers itself: obviously the environmental factors - both positive and negative - are going to impact any persons success or failures. It's interesting to see if there are any relationships or patterns in these factors, but, personally, I think it is a bit of a stretch. We should not let things like that affect the way we want to organize our lives. However, if one is purely interested in studying which environmental factors were important for a SELECTED FEW PERSONNEL in last century, this would be a good read. It might even go as far as to show you some hidden opportunities around you, how they managed to overcome their difficulties and how to utilize whatever resources available, and to provide some motivation. But that is not the point of the book is it... at least as the name suggests...""We are too much in awe of those who succeed and far too dismissive in those who fail,""!121!The term I've coined for books such as these is ""the illusion of erudition."" We love the anecdotes, many a form of comfirmation bias---the author telling us what we want to hear (cha-ching)---and we feel oh so much wiser once the wheels of the plane touch down on the runway at our destination because of having read a book such as this on our flight.====================================The famous, or infamous concept of the 10,000 ""rule"" in this book is not real. In a 2012 paper in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the lead author of the original study about the practice time of elite violinists, K. Anders Ericsson, ascribed the phrase’s popularity to a chapter title in Outliers, which, Ericsson wrote, “misconstrued” the conclusions of the violin study. Ericsson himself never used the number 10,000 or the term ""rule."" Gladwell made that up. Ericsson extended his study to sports. Author David Espstein reports on the results (next four paragraphs)....In fact, in absolutely every single study of sports expertise, there is a tremendous range of hours of practice logged by athletes who reach the same level, and very rarely do elite performers log 10,000 hours of sport-specific practice prior to reaching the top competitive plane, often competing in a number of other sports— and acquiring a range of other athletic skills— before zeroing in on one. Studies of athletes have tended to find that the top competitors require far less than 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to reach elite status. According to the scientific literature, the average sport-specific practice hours to reach the international levels in basketball, field hockey, and wrestling are closer to 2,000, 4,000, and 6,000, respectively. In a sample of Australian women competing in netball (sort of like basketball but without dribbling or backboards), arguably the best player in the world at the time, Vicki Wilson, had compiled only 600 hours of practice when she made the national team. A study of athletes on Australia’s senior national teams found that 28 percent of them started their sport at an average age of seventeen, having previously tried on average three other sports, and and debuted at the international level just four years later.Even in this age of hyperspecialization in sports, some rare individuals become world-class athletes, and even world champions, in sports from running to rowing with less than a year or two of training. As with studies of chess players, in all sports and skills, the only real rule is that there is a tremendous natural range.======The down side to the Gladwell ""rule"" is that you see many unhappy kids out there being ground through the requisite ""hours"" by parents hoping their children will get scholarships or maybe go pro. I've coached enough youth sports to know there needs to be some base talent to build on for a young person to excel. I've also seen many 12-year olds who were stars at that age, but who faded by age 16, no matter how many hours they put in. I've coached youth sports for years. I've seen this over and over.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/op...===========At the gym one day, I ran into a varsity high school football coach, whose team had just won the California state championship. I asked him about ""the 10,000 rule.""He said: ""it's ruined many kids' lives.""70% of kids quit sports by age 13, many of them because “it’s not fun anymore.”==============More falsehood called out by The Sports Gene....""In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell makes a point about height in basketball by comparing it to IQ. There is a threshold, he writes, above which more does not really matter. Above an IQ of 120—which already eliminates most of humanity—he argues, one is already smart enough to consider the most difficult intellectual problems, and more IQ does not translate into real-world success. In basketball, he adds, “it’s probably better to be six two than six one . . . But past a certain point, height stops mattering so much.” But the “threshold hypothesis” of IQ is not supported by the work of scientists who specialize in that field, nor is the threshold hypothesis of NBA height supported by player data.""Does Gladwell do any real research or fact-checking? Apparently not. He can't be trusted. I guess he has some readers think they're geniuses if they have an IQ of 120.================It struck me that Gladwell is like a prosperity Gospel preacher who tells people what they want to hear. And uses anecdotes that supposedly prove his points.I saw a couple of minutes of the most famous such preacher in the U.S. right now, Joel Osteen, who holds forth in a retrofitted basketball stadium in Houston. He began with: ""God is faithful. That promotion you've been waiting for: it's just around the corner. That lifetime soulmate you've always been looking for is on the way to you right now. The bonus money you need to take a vacation: you'll get that check by Christmas.""Then he'll use some story, usually from the Old Testament, to illustrate. And throw in a couple of contemporary anecdotes. ""I met a man.....""What if these good things don't come true? The dark side is that you get blamed. Somehow you've incurred God's displeasure.So you got cut from the team? It must be because you only put in 9,500 hours of practice instead of 10,0000.======================The backstory on Gladwell...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...=========More parental insanity pushing kids to make parents proud....""Backyards feature batting cages, pitching tunnels, fencing pistes, Olympic-size hockey rinks complete with floodlights and generators. Hotly debated zoning-board topics include building codes for at-home squash courts and storm-drainage plans to mitigate runoff from private ice rinks. Whereas the Hoop Dreamers of the Chicago projects pursued sports as a path out of poverty and hardship, the kids of Fairfield County aren’t gunning for the scholarship money. It’s more about status maintenance, by any means necessary.""""Katie Andersen, who runs an Orange County, California–based college-advising company called College Fit, says that among the moral dilemmas the families she works with face is whether to come clean with a college coach about their kids’ multiple concussions. “Parents will be sitting in my office debating whether it makes sense to tell, and I want to scream.” Instead, she tries to play nice: “I say, ‘Can we please step back and think about your child? He’s had three concussions, multiple overuse injuries, multiple surgeries—and he’s playing soccer in college? There’s not even a question of him not playing?’ ”I call this stolen childhoods.!121!People are criticizing this book because it is not a journal article. Well guess what: we're not all sociologists. I have read plenty of journal articles in my own field (law). I'm in no position to read journal articles in fields outside my own. Having a well-written piece of mass-market writing is just the thing I need to access this information.Another criticism of the book is that Gladwell is the ""master of the anecdote."" Well, it seems to me that ALL SOCIAL SCIENCE is in some sense anecdotal. Every survey (even a methodologically perfect one) is necessarily un-abstract and anecdotal: it is based on survey research from particular people, and there's no way to derive abstract rules governing society from that like math. This notion of how Gladwell is all anecdotal bothers me. So what? If a good anecdote gets you to look at a situation in a new way or makes a powerful point, that's excellent! Any writer worth his or her salt LOVES a good anecdote to grab the attention of the reader.!121!Well, it's official: Malcolm Gladwell has run out of things to say.His prose is still lively and entertaining, and he maintains his famous I-look-at-things-differently-than-anyone-else attitude, but ""Outliers"" has so little meat that it would have more appropriately been published as a magazine article.I think that the main value of reading Gladwell is that he plants a seed in your brain that encourages you to seek unconventional explanations for familiar phenomena. That's a very healthy thing, and I'm not trying to disparage its significance. But if you're looking for a book that provides meaningful insights, ""Outliers"" isn't it.!121!In just one week, this book transformed a relatively normal woman into someone who's been saying, ""Well, in this book I'm reading. . . you know, Outliers? Yeah, there's this section on. . . there's this part about. . . You should read this chapter. . . No, no, just wait here and let me read these 3 pages out loud for you. . . Have you read it? Oh, you haven't? Let me just show you this one page, it'll just take a minute!""I can't think of one reason why you shouldn't join me in my enthusiasm.!121!Recommend to: If you like exploring phenomenon beyond their appearance and if you enjoy story-telling writings about factual subjects, here: successWhat this book is about: Here, the famous columnist, Malcolm Gladwell deeply investigates the topic of success and people or nations with far beyond average achievements whom he calls ""outliers"" to figure out what has contributed to their accomplishments.ProsThe way Gladwell observes and concludes is so enticing and far different from what you might think about why a phenomenon has happened. For example, see how these arguments might sound: 1. Chinese are good at math because of their way of sowing and reaping rice in the fields. 2. The flight number X crashed, because the co-pilot was Colombian. And any other Colombian in his place might have led to the very same outcome. Strange? Yes, is seems so, and Malcolm nicely shows how these seemingly unrelated events are tightly bound.So from the point of the way he see's things differently and actually tries to find real reasons behind events you'll find the book amusing and thought provoking.ConsThere are two major problems I have with this book. First, he nicely let’s say detects the roots from which success is grown and these roots he argues, are all mainly what we can have no part on cultivating or choosing. Things like the date of birth (which opens up opportunities for practice in cases he studies etc.), or cultural background. But it would have been much nicer had he provided vivid guidelines on now that we can't choose the roots, how we can provide the opportunities and the environment caused by the roots.The other problem with some of his observations is that they can be potentially badly flawed or be results of what scientists say clustering. Namely, you look at a particular area with particular trends and specifications and you extend the qualities to the whole group in other areas. Or in situations I think, despite his keen observation and uncovering an aspect of an event, fails to see other dimensions as well. For example, in one part he says “Because of the limitation of lands in china, farmers had to be smarter and work smarter on their lands to increase production in contrast with their counterparts in America who used advanced machinery to increase the harvest and productivity. Now my argument: Haven't the Americans been smart to build such advanced machineries? :| All in all  the book was often engaging and thought provoking and if you want to read it, have it read skeptically, for the book if not absorbed well because of the amount of emphasis he seemingly puts on chance (things we have no will to choose on our own like parents, birthday, cultural background, etc.) might end up discouraging. The book's message though I think is noble, really noble, which tries to tell that communities and societies are responsible for provisioning an environment in which members can fulfill their potentials. Oh by the way, the famous 10000 hours rule for mastery is the result of the Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson studies and was merely popularized, by Malcolm Gladwell.!121!Here's what I wrote earlier. I have to admit to the more I think and talk about the book, the less I think of it. It all seems too superficial.A pretty interesting book, albeit with not quite as many ""knock me over with a feather"" moments as Blink. It starts off with a bang, as he discusses amateur hockey teams and how it was noticed that virtually all the players on an Under-18 hockey team came from the first three months of the year. Turns out the age cutoff is January 1 in Canada, so the older players (those born early in the year) advanced further due to their slight maturity advantage which continued to multiply, as they got better training, put on better teams etc.This subject hits close to home, as I am a soccer coach and heavily involved in my daughter's soccer league. My oldest has a birthday at the worst possible time, just a few weeks before the cutoff date, while the younger one has a birthday the month after the cutoff date. So far, it hasn't seemed to slow the older one's progress, but it is something I will certainly keep an eye on. Gladwell's suggestion is to have multiple cutoff dates, so other ages can play against others of the same age. Doesn't seem likely though.He also explores how the timing of your interests can really change things. Something as simple as how available computer time was to early pioneers like Bill Gates and Bill Joy. Certainly, in the late 60s and early 70s, the amount of keyboard time these guys had pales in comparison to what would be available just a few years before that. He also talks about a major law firm in New York that benefited from getting the kinds of financial cases the other law firms wouldn't deal with, only to explode in popularity as the money days of the 80s and 90s struck.I thought the book felt like it suffered from data mining, in that there didn't seem to be enough exploration of other equally successful groups that may not have had the same advantages. But still a fascinating look at what kinds of thing influence success, whether we think about them or not.!121!I skimmed this book instead of reading it. I didn’t entirely love it.Although the author makes some interesting points, I find some of the correlations he tries to draw a little silly. Like the Italian community in Pennsylvania where people are healthier and live longer because they have a sense of “community” or the fact that Southerners react more violently to certain situations than Northerners because they derive from a “culture of honor.” Sounds like extrapolated horseshit to me, especially considering the sample size. And when the author is making sense, I feel like he isn’t telling us anything we don’t already know. Like the fact that success breeds success, opportunity is key, practice pays off, etc. One of the few things I do find interesting, however, are differences noted in the way children are raised and the fact that some degree of entitlement being taught to them early can actually be beneficial as they mature into adulthood, mostly because they’d be able to use this sense of entitlement to demand higher salaries and better job positions.Regardless, this was my first experience skimming. I'm not sure I’ll do it again anytime soon.!121!Ever wondered why Bill Gates is so rich? Or why the Beatles is considered to be a ""once in a millennium"" band? (or why people find ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" to be so trippy, lol) Or simply, why some people are so outrageously successful while others wallow in mediocrity?An enthralling psychology novel by Malcolm Gladwell, ""Outliers"" reveals the secrets behind the success of some of the most famous people in the world. The book, with its sublime delivery and almost fantastical (though real) anecdotes has the capacity of enamouring even pure fiction lovers. As it is said, ""life is stranger than fiction.""Malcolm's meticulous exploration of the various factors that can have a profound effect on success leaves the readers erudite and their interest piqued.Outliers: The Story of Success leaves audience with knowledge of how to entice some of that success into their own lives. If nothing else, at least you will be able to figure out why those particularly irksome people in your network behave so, lmao (upon extrapolating information gleaned from a part of the book).""Outliers"" is a remarkable piece of non-fiction conveyed in a compelling manner.!121!Outliers. Or as it should be called, ""Outliers don't exist."" I not only couldn't put it down, but my wife feels like she's read it now too. It starts with a story about a town whose inhabitants only ever die from old age (i.e., not from cancer or ANY OTHER problem) and quickly goes into a story about hockey players in Canada.For some reason the best hockey players are born in January through March and rarely any time after. The reason - it's all because of the date of the cut-off for playing hockey in the junior leagues (I use that meaning ""for little guys first playing"" not because it is in any way accurate as to the actual name). Because the cut-off date for kids joining the hockey league is January 1, those born right after have to wait about a year to join. What happens when one kids plays against another who is a year older? They get slaughtered (in only a sports sense ... I hope). That year makes a difference to the little guys (and girls) and so they get to play on the advanced team, they get to be an all-star and therefore, they get more and more playing time. What starts out as an arbitrary date, turns into something real since those who get more playing time actually become better and end up making up the majority of the professionals. This strikes a particular cord with me, being a December birthday. Luckily I've never had the desire to become a professional hockey player ... or lived in Canada (not a Canada slight, I love you guys eh!).Anyway, this book is filled with stories like this, making the point that when it seems like someone is a unique and even a prodigy, it usually is because of way more factors than just they worked hard and they are smart.From Mozart to Bill Gates and even geniuses who never made a mark on society. To airplane copilots who rather than speak up about a problem, lead the plane directly into a mountain. To the fact that there really isn't a magical type of person who becomes great, but someone who can put in the right amount of practice to do so (10,000 hours to be exact). But then again, you have to be blessed with the ability to have those hours of practice rather than being forced to survival.His main point is that societies and culture and even timing (like birth) make up a lot of who people are and why they become ""outliers."" That an outlier doesn't really exist because it's a person who is a product of their surroundings. A good portion of the richest people throughout history were born within 9 years of each other, just in time to take advantage of the industrial revolution. This is an extremely eye-opening book that comes highly recommended. I couldn't stop thinking about it or talking about it and I already have another of his books, Blink, ready in the queue. The only criticism I can make is that as with most arguments, those that aren't as advantageous to his claims are left in the background a bit. He says that the timing of birth is a factor and I certainly think so, but it's also because of one or two of those people born that the next big shift in society happens and I don't think that can be ruled out. However, that's not even mentioned.Anyway, it got me thinking and you can too!4 out of 5 Stars (highly recommended)PS. The audiobook is read by the author and he reads his own words well. :)!121!ژنرال مسئول پروژه منهتن، لسلی گرووز، سرتاسر آمریکا را زیر پا گذاشته بود تا بهترین فرد را برای رهبری پروژه‌ی تولید بمب اتمی پیدا کند. انصافا، اوپنهایمر شانس چندانی نداشت. او فقط 38 سال داشت و از بسیاری از افراد زیر دستش جوان‌تر بود. تخصصش در علوم نظری بود، در حالی که این شغل به مهندسان و آزمونگرها نیاز داشت. تمایلات سیاسی‌اش سمت و سوی مشخصی نداشت: دوستانش اهل فرقه‌های گوناگون کمونیستی بودند. شاید نکته‌ی تعجب آور آن بود که او هرگز تجربه‌ای در کار اجرایی نداشت. یکی از دوستانش بعد‌ها در مورد او می‌گفت: ""مردی بسیار بی‌دست و پا بود. با کفش‌هایی مندرس وکلاهی عجیب و غریب این طرف و آن طرف می‌رفت و، مهم‌تر آنکه، درباره‌ی وسایل و تجهیزات کوچکترین اطلاعی نداشت."" یا به بیان مختصر و مفید یکی از دانشمندان دانشگاه برکلی، ""او حتی دکه‌ی ساندویچ فروشی را هم نمی‌توانست اداره کند."" و این نکته را هم اضافه کنید که در دوران تحصیلات تکمیلی سعی کرده بود استاد راهنمایش را بکشد. این رزومه‌ی مردی است که در تلاش بود شغلی را به دست آورد که بی اغراق می‌شد آن را یکی از مهم‌ترین شغل‌های قرن بیستم نامید. و چه اتفاقی افتاد؟ درست همان اتفاقی که بیست سال پیش در کمبریج روی داده بود: کاری کرد که سایرین موضوع را از دریچه‌ی چشم وی ببینند. صفحات 106 و 107 کتابغیر ممکن است که یکی از بازیکنان هاکی یا بیل جوی یا روبرت اوپنهایمر یا هر نخبه‌ی دیگری از جایگاه رفیع خود به پایین بنگرد و با صداقت بگوید: ""تمام آنچه انجام دادم کار خودم به تنهایی بوده است."" در نگاه اول به نظر می‌رسد وکلای بزرگ، نوابغ ریاضی و غول‌های دنیای نرم‌افزار جایی ورای تجارب عادی قرار می‌گیرند، اما این طور نیست. آنها محصول تاریخ و جامعه‌ی خود هستند، محصول فرصت‌ها و میراثشان. موفقیت آنها امری استثنایی یا راز آلود نیست، بلکه در شبکه‌ی در هم تنیده‌ای از امتیازها و ویژگی‌های وراثتی- که گاه شایستگی‌اش را داشته‌اند و گاه نداشته‌اند، بعضی را با تلاش به دست آورده‌اند و بعضی را با شانس محض- در هم پیچیده که همه در ساختن هویت امروزینشان نقش اساسی دارد. ختم کلام آنکه نخبگان اصلا نخبه نیستند. ص 287 کتاب!121!موفقیت یک مقوله فردی نیست. بلکه یک رخداد اجتماعیهاگر روزی مثل نویسنده ما در حال تماشای بازی هاکی می‌بودید (نویسنده کاناداییه و هاکی اونجا ورزش اوله) و اگر مثل نویسنده ما دقت و کنجکاوی زیادی می‌داشتید ، ممکن بود یک موضوع عجیب و غریب، نظر شما رو هم جلب کنه. اینکه بیشتر بازیکنانی که توی زمینن، متولدین سه ماه اول سال هستن.برای ما که موفقیت رو صرفا بر مبنای خصلت‌های فردی تعبیر می‌کنیم، این مقوله جزو داده‌های تصادفی قرار می‌گیره. اما لااقل در این مورد بخصوص، دلیل قابل تاملی وجود داره: ""نظام استعدادیابی بازکنان هاکی در کانادا بچه‌ها رو سال به سال ارزیابی می‌کنه."" کودکی که در مدرسه متولد سه ماه اول سال هست نسبت به کسی که با 8 ماه اختلاف سنی سر همون کلاس نشسته برتری فیزیکی اندکی داره که در سنین پایین خیلی تعیین کننده است. همین برتری خفیف در سنین پایین منجر به انتخاب شدن این بچه ها می‌شه تا روشون کار بشه و نهایتا بعضی از اونها در آینده بازیکنان حرفه‌ای لیگ هاکی کانادا می‌شن. طی این فرایند، جامعه با نظام گزینشی خودش عده‌ای رو به طور اتوماتیک از موفق شدن محروم می‌کنه و به عده‌ای مزیت رقابتی می‌ده. کتاب نسخه به ظاهر ساده‌ای از چگونگی رسیدن به ""موفقیت درخشان"" ارائه می‌کنه: ده هزار ساعت کار و تمرین مداوم که چیزی حدود 10 سال زمان می‌طلبه.  این عدد رو مالکوم گلدول از یک آزمایشی که روی عده‌ای هنرجوی ویلون انجام شده بدست آورده و به شکل جالبی به خیلی افراد موفق هم نسبت می‌ده: بزرگان ""سیلیکون ولی"" من‌جمله بیل گیتس، استیو جابز و بیل جوی، گروه موسیقی بیتلز، استادبزرگان شطرنج من جمله بابی فیشر و ... همگی و بلا استثنا با تقریب قابل قبولی همین میزان کار رو قبل از رسیدن به موفقیت داشتن. کتاب خیلی مفصل راجع به ناگفته‌های زندگی افرادی که نام بردیم توضیحاتی داده و انصافا حقایق قانع کننده‌ای ارائه می‌ده که آوردنش در این مقال نمی‌گنجه. اما لُب مطلب که بر خلاف تمایل ما به ساختن افسانه‌هایی راجع به غلبه بر تمام موانع و سختی‌ها برای رسیدن به موفقیت یا احیانا هوش خارق‌العاده و غیر عادی، بسیاری از کسانی که ما اونها رو نابغه می‌دونیم طی دوران نوجوانی شرایط بسیار مساعدی رو تجربه کردن که براشون بستری فراهم آورد تا بتونن حدود 10 هزار ساعت توی اون زمینه دلخواهشون ممارست کنن تا بعدها در زمان مناسب، صاحب تجارب اندوخته کافی باشن که نهایتا ""موفقیت‌های درخشان"" اونها رو رقم زد. در این رابطه، افسانه‌زدایی از نبوغ دوران کودکی موتسارت حقیقتا برام جالب توجه بود.در واقع کل بحثی که گلدول توی کتابش ارائه می‌کنه رو میشه اینطور خلاصه کرد: ""محاله کسی بدون داشتن یک محیط مساعد بتونه ده هزار ساعت تمرین لازم برای رسیدن به اون ""مهارت متمایز کننده از دیگران"" رو انجام بده. "" اگر شما فقیر باشی و فراغت کافی برای زمان گذاشتن در اون زمینه بخصوص رو نداشته باشی،اگر محیط زندگی شما اون امکانات لازم برای انجام تمرین رو در اختیار شما قرار نداده باشه،یا اگر جامعه مثل بازیکنان هاکی، طی یک فرایند اتوماتیک، شما رو از انجام این میزان تمرین محروم کنه،شما نخواهی توانست به موفقیت برسی. حتی اگر استعداد ذاتی و ژنتیکی اون در شما باشه. کتاب با بررسی لیستی از ثروتمندترین افراد جهان نکته‌ای رو به چشم ما میاره. اینکه حدود 20 درصد از ثروتمندترین افراد کل تاریخ جهان (یعنی با معادل سازی از زمان مصر باستان تا به امروز)، متولد آمریکا طی سال‌های 1830 تا 1840 هستن.  بسیار تامل برانگیزه که ببینیم چه اتفاقی افتاده. مساله اینه که این افراد طی سالهای 1860 تا 1870 که اوج شکوفایی اقتصادی آمریکا هست، در سن مناسب و در جای مناسب قرار گرفتن. اینها همون افرادی بودن که در زمانی که شرایط اقتصادی مهیا شده بود، اون 10 هزار ساعت کار و مهارت رو اندوخته بودن و کاملا مستعد به موفقیت رسیدن بودن.مخلص کلام اینکه، موفقیت یک رخداد اجتماعیه. همونطور که ما پیدایش آتش رو به شخص خاصی نسبت نمی‌دیم (اگرچه واقعا اولش یک نفری بوده که بار اول آتیش رو کشف کرده) موفقیت‌های افراد مختلف، نتیجه محیط پیرامون افراد و به نوعی بخشی از نظام طبیعی و اجتماعی انسان‌هاست. درسته که همه متولدین سه ماهه اول سال وارد لیگ حرفه‌ای هاکی کانادا نمی‌شن و فقط اونهایی که ممارست و تلاش زیادی انجام می‌دن به این موفقیت نائل می‌شن، اما نکته بسیار کلیدی اینه که درک کنیم همه کسانی که سخت کار می‌کنن و ممارست زیادی بخرج می‌دن به موفقیت نمی‌رسن. برای موفقیت بسترهایی لازمه که باید جامعه اون رو در اختیار شما قرار بده. چون همونطور که گفتیم، موفقیت یک رخداد اجتماعیه.!121!One of the finest books I have read this year.  How exactly does this work? How do some people achieve more, while others don’t even get the opportunity?The fascinating analysis of the American Football(Rugby) team gave me a new way to look at the system. Most American Football players are born in the first 5 months of a calendar year. Coincidence?I bet not. I don’t want to spoil the fun, read the book to know more.  The author tells numerous true stories of what appear to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and  takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of cultural background and a set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed.Some of his best books are:1. The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (discusses the dynamics of social change)2. Outliers: The Story of Success (discusses the subject of success) 3. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (discusses decision making)Grab your copy here or here.!121!Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good.Malcolm Gladwell always makes you reconsider what you thought you knew. In Outliers, he drills down into the mythos of the so-called self-made man. It turns out that, underneath the surface, there is far more right-place-right-time luck than successful people seem to believe. The second half of the book, about cultural influences in individual success, is in some ways the more interesting part, if only because it is even more counterintuitive than the first half. A quick, entertaining and informative read. Recommended.!121!""Outliers"" those wildly successful people, for whom 'normal rules don't apply.' Are they just lucky, talented? Maybe...but, outliers may not be outliers after all...after reading the entire book, I was slapped by that at the very end. Gladwell looks closely at success, and those who seem to have waltzed into incredible success...Canadian hockey players, who just happened to have been born in the right month of the year; Bill Gates, who just happened to go to a school where the PTA moms bought a new-fangled computer system. Mozart, who didn't hit his stride until ten years after he began composing...the Beatles! Their sound was born of the 10,000 hours of performing in Hamburg -- more than other groups could amass in years of playing.Success is timing, and hard work...10,000 hours of practice required. It's luck -- having the right family, having the right opportunities -- Gladwell's description: ""a combination of ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage...beneficiaries or some kind of unusual opportunity.""Gladwell's storytelling is so easy to fall into. We go with him anywhere...to a small town in Italy, to his own Jamaican family, and everywhere in between. I know Gladwell has an essay in TELLING TRUE STORIES, about narrative journalism, and I enjoyed reading this, more aware of the craft he practices...nonfiction storytelling.When Bill Gates admits he was very lucky, Gladwell hammers home that point. But to me, the 100,000 hour rule is what I'll take with me. Do you want to be the best? Put in the effort! Talent and opportunity can help, but success is hard work.!121!""If only I'd read this book earlier,"" the old man sighed. He shook his head sadly. ""I was at the wrong end of the cut-off age. I'd have made a champion swimmer..."". His voice trailed off.""Hmmm.""He sighed again. ""Then there's this 10000 hour rule. What the hell am I supposed to do about it now? The only thing I have 10000 hours practice is of scrunching my nose when my wife farts. And even that is more due to habit now. You get used to the smell pretty quickly."" He shook his head again. ""It's the cabbages. She loves them too much.""""I guess.""""I wish I was born in a 'culture of honour'. If I had been, I would not have just stood there and nodded meekly when my boss told me that I was the love child of a donkey and a pigeon. I would have given him one - right in the kisser. Right in the kisser, I tell you boy.""""Er...but wouldn't that have landed you in jail?""""Ah, I would have done good in prison, boy. Would have run the prison library and made it famous, like that guy in Shawshank.""""Of course.""""I wasn't ever meant to be an outlier. Life dealt me the wrong hand."" ""Then how would reading the book earlier have helped?""He looked at me incredulously. ""Why, it would have changed my life! I wouldn't have felt sad at my failures. I would have regarded them as inevitable. I would have waved the book at everyone who looked at me as a loser. I would have...I would have...""I was distraught. ""Oh, Mr. Blake, why couldn't you have bought the book 35 years ago when it came out?"" I felt really bad. This wasn't fair.He shook his head and sighed prodigiously. ""Ah boy, that's the worst part. My boss gave me this book on my 30th birthday. But I hated him so much, I threw it away in the dustbin.""I burst out crying.!121!بسیار لذت بردم، این کتاب چند تا مزیت اساسی داشت.۱- اولین و مهم ترین مزیت اینکه به هیچ وجه حوصلتون سر نمیره چون گلدول توی داستان تعریف کردن استاده و یه ترکیب خیلی خوبی از تعریف داستان و اوردن تحقیقات اماری علمی به وجود آورده.۲- دومین مزیت این بود که مطالبش جدید بود و به آدم دیدگاه متفاوتی نسبت به مسئله موفقیت میداد، بعد از خوندن این کتاب دیگه فردی خودش و دیگران رو راجب وضعیت زندگیشون قضاوت نمیکنه چون میدونه موفقیت تابع هزاران متغیره.۳- در کنار مطالب جالب این کتاب فایده فردی هم داره و باعث میشه فرد تلاشش رو توی جهت موثری متمرکز کنه، مسیر که توش مزیت نسبی داره. مزیت نسبی از هر جهت که شامل خانواده و کشور و تحصیلات و سن و ... میشه.۴- افسانه ی افرادی مثل بیل گیتس و استیو جابز و امثالهم توی این کتاب میشکنه و بلاخره همه متوجه میشن که عوامل موفقیت این افراد هم علاوه بر خودشون هزار تا مزیت جانبی بود که از آمریکا و از خانوادشون گرفتن. گلدول به خوبی ثابت میکنه که چیزی به اسم موفق self-made وجود نداره.۵- زبان کتاب آسونه حتی اگر توی انگلیسی مهارت زیادی ندارید میتونید راحت بخونید البته پارت دوم کتاب یه مقدار کلمات پیچیده تری داره.!121!Here is my animated review! youtu.be/5HUjk6Zf0xgThis book made me think about the advantages and disadvantages connected to the birth date, place and few other things most kids can't change.!121!OUTLIERS:: a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of the sample: a person or thing that is atypical within a particular group, class, or categoryDefinition from Merriam-Webster Dictionary.In this book Malcolm Gladwell examines why some people achieve such extraordinary success. He looks at hockey players who make it to the NHL, a rock band, software entrepreneurs, lawyers and financial tycoons.There was some controversy over the views he expressed in this book, mainly about his 10,000 hour rule, which he explains as that it takes 10,000 hours of dedicated practice to become a success. The arguments revolve around the question of innate talent versus practice. In supporting this theory he somewhat “Cherry Picks” his examples. However, no matter what your interests there is probably something in these examples that will entertain you. This was a very easy and entertaining book to read.First of all regarding The Beatles, he tells of the fact that as a young band they played some “gigs” in Hamburg, Germany, where on some occasions they performed on stage for up to eight hours.The Canadian Hockey players story is perhaps his best example. The cutoff birthday for the different leagues for the young beginning players is January 1. This means a player born in December is playing against a player born in January who is stronger, more coordinated and more mature. This gives the older player an advantage when the selection for the better teams is made. The better teams get better coaching, more practice, they play in more games and they play against better players. He noticed this by examining the rosters of the championship teams where the majority of the players were born in January, February or March.These examples support his 10,000 hour theory, but there are other interesting stories about the birthdates of some successful people.He writes about a listing of the 75 richest people in human history (calculated in current US dollars). Fourteen of those on the list are Americans born in a nine year span (1831-1840) in the mid-nineteenth century. Almost 20 percent of the names on this list are men born in a single generation in a single country. The reason:
In the 1860s and 1870s, the American economy went through perhaps the greatest transformation in its history. This was when the railroads were being built and when Wall Street emerged. It was when industrial manufacturing started in earnest.
That meant if you were born in the 1830s you were the perfect age for taking advantage of the emerging economy. Similarly he points out that some of the well-known software entrepreneurs were born in the mid-1950s. Bill Gates was born in 1955, Paul Allen, born 1953, Steve Ballmer, born 1956, and Steve Jobs, born 1955. These were people born at a time when they reached maturity with the age of the micro-computer, when there was a special opportunity to work hard and achieve extraordinary rewards.There are also some interesting sections on Jewish lawyers who practiced the law that the “White Firms” ignored. There is some stories of child geniuses and their path in life. He deals with parenting issues of wealthy versus poor children. He ends with the story of his mother and the events of her life which allowed him to have a better life.This is the second time I have read this book. I have a couple of books coming up soon about success and performance, at least one of which takes issue with Gladwell’s 10,000 hour rule. I wanted to familiarize myself with Gladwell’s theory before reading those books. I am not the most astute analyst so I may not accurately be able to dispute Gladwell. However, I am familiar with the criticism that there is some self-fulfilling prophecy present here. I recall a Professor in college saying “Proof by example is fraud.” However, he does end the book with the following observation which to me seems a good summation:Superstar lawyers and math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear at first blush to lie outside ordinary experience. But they don’t. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky — but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all. (Page 285)!121!I don't know about Malcolm Gladwell. I've read 3 of his books. All of them fine, but nothing special. All of them fairly superficial with nothing original or innovative. I think his books are very pop culture and should be read in the time frame (say within a year) that they are published. Too long after that and they become stale, not prolific or prescient. Gladwell is a very good and interesting writer, but I don't think his books have much depth or staying power.Almost 3.5 StarsRead on kindle.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Audiobook']"
Becoming (Hardcover),Michelle Obama,4.46,1037881,2018,"In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.","Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:-	Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”-	Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?-	Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?-	Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?-	Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?-	Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite” -	Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?-	Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.-	Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).-	Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.-	Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?-	Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.-	Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.-	Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.-	Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”-	“Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97-	“Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97-	“I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97-	“Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99-	“There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99-	“He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101-	“Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103-	“He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105-	“Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105-	“Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111-	“This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112-	“I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117-	 “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123-	“All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131-	For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don’t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):-	She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.-	Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.-	She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.-	She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.-	She failed the bar exam the first time around-	She very much dislikes politics-	She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.-	She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.-	Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house-	She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don’t know if she is always successful.-	She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can’t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn’t making the positive impact she wanted too.  Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I’d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle’s life in one word is would be “busy” and one word to describe Michelle herself would be “workaholic”. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself ""who cares?"". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say “yeah, I read that book”. That being said, it isn’t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people’s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.	As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn’t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they’ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me. 	Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn’t that good. I didn’t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my “identity” but I had to otherwise I just would’ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the “identity” of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn’t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole “grab them by the pussy” remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn’t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.!121!I didn’t think I could admire and respect former First Lady Michelle Obama any more than I already did. For eight years she graced our country with her presence, her intellect, her caring. We never had to ask because it is obvious in everything she says and does that she does care. Without a doubt, she cares more than anything about her family, but also cares deeply about this country. Then I read this book, an eloquent memoir, strikingly honest and as inspiring as I suspected it would be. I felt even more admiration and respect for her. She recounts her time growing up on the South Side of Chicago as she shares the joys of her childhood as well as some of the tough things. She was a feisty child, driven to do well in school. Her story begins : “I spent much of my childhood listening to the sound of striving.” She speaks lovingly of her roots in this working class family - her parents and her brother and grandparents and how their values shaped the adult she would become. We witness the grief she experienced over the loss of her father and her continuing admiration and love for her mother who was tenacious in seeking a good education for her children. In this memoir, she is so open and honest and it feels so intimate. Michelle shares her love for her husband and daughters. She speaks about the discrimination against the men in her family, about being black at Princeton, about the attacks on her husband’s citizenship, a conspiracy theory primary pushed by the person who unfortunately followed him after his second term. We discover who she is in the times she is undergoing a self discovery, as she questions her aspirations, as she juggles work and motherhood as Barack’s involvement and aspirations in politics grow. It felt so intimate as she shares some personal struggles that they faced, ones that I don’t think she ever divulged publicly previous to this. The things she chose to focus on as First Lady - children and their health, assisting military families, developing a program for mentoring young women reflect the things that are important to her and the kind of person she is. With an intellect such as hers, she easily could have taken on larger policy issues, but instead focused on children and families bringing people into the White House who would not have had the opportunity to be there if not for her. This book is over 400 pages and it never felt long. The writing is good and I just kept turning page after page always interested in what she would say next. A remarkable story of a remarkable woman.!121!I’d been lucky to have parents, teachers, and mentors who’d fed me with a consistent, simple message: You matter. As an adult, I wanted to pass those words to a new generation.
Look, I'm not a happy crier. I might cry at songs about leaving and missing someone; I might cry at books where things don't work out; I might cry at movies where someone dies. I've just never really understood why people get all choked up over happy, inspirational things. But Michelle Obama's kindness and empathy changed that. This book had me in tears for all the right reasons.This is not really a book about politics, though political experiences obviously do come into it. It's a shame that some will dismiss this book because of a difference in political opinion, when it is really about a woman's life. About growing up poor and black on the South Side of Chicago; about getting married and struggling to maintain that marriage; about motherhood; about being thrown into an amazing and terrifying position.I hate words like ""inspirational"" because they've become so overdone and cheesy, but I just have to say it-- Michelle Obama is an inspiration. I had the privilege of seeing her speak at The Forum in Inglewood, and she is one of the warmest, funniest, smartest, down-to-earth people I have ever seen in this world.And yes, I know we present what we want the world to see, but I truly do think it's genuine. I think she is someone who really cares about people - especially kids - and wants to give them better lives and opportunities. She's obviously intelligent, but she also doesn't gussy up her words. She talks straight, with an openness and honesty rarely seen. She's been one of the most powerful women in the world, she's been a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School, she's had her own successful career, and yet she has remained throughout that same girl - Michelle Robinson - from a working class family in Chicago.I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube!121!I understand the hype!I didn't know much about Michelle Obama nor her husband. This book absolutely humanized them and show me how much they care about others. The contrast with the actual political situation is blatant.Recommend!!121!i’m so glad that i got the audiobook for this back and finally was able to finish all these months later!michelle obama sharing her experience and dropping nuggets of wisdom into my ear holes for 19 hours straight was just a delightful experience :)!121!MICHELLE MY HEART this is going to be good!121!I’m so thrilled to add Becoming to my list! A powerful, surprising and moving book as well as refreshingly candid that I think will be deeply inspirational to many.!121!Loved this!!121!Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is something to own.
Michelle Obama, First Lady of the United States, quickly became one of the most iconic women of the White House. In this memoir, she reflects on what her life was like as she was raised on the South Side of Chicago and her roots in her working class family.
Do we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?
We learn about her college life and her career as a lawyer. Along the way, we experience the grief she felt when she lost her father too soon.
It hurts to live after someone has died. It just does. It can hurt to walk down a hallway or open the fridge...You look at something you’d otherwise find beautiful—a purple sky at sunset or a playground full of kids—and it only somehow deepens the loss. Grief is so lonely this way.
And we get to follow along as she met Barrack Obama, a junior lawyer, and what it was like dating (and eventually marrying) the future president.And from there, we learn what the White House is like - from the gardens to the galas, Michelle Obama walks through every aspect of juggling work, motherhood and being the First Lady.
Time, as far as my father was concerned, was a gift you gave to other people.
Oh my gosh. People. This was perfect. This absolutely gorgeous book had me hooked from the very start. It was beautiful, it was poignant, it made me cry in public - it had everything I could've wanted in a memoir and more.When she talked about her love for her father, and how painful that loss was, I couldn't stop the flow of tears.. It truly got to me in the best way possible.Also, learning about the rest of her family - her brother, parents and grandparents - really helped me understand what her childhood was like and how it shaped her into the wonderful woman she is today. I was surprised about what she all accomplished when in the White House and I'm really shaking my head at how I missed knowing this earlier. We were so lucky and blessed to have this woman in our White House - I honestly cannot recommend this enough.
At fifty-four, I am still in progress, and I hope that I always will be.
YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!Audiobook read by Michelle ObamaFor the past three days - all I wanted to do was listen to Michelle Obama..... I cried - or was teary-eyed so many times - I lost count. THIS BOOK must be ‘especially’ special to her immediate family and closest friends ....but it’s also a great gift to the rest of us. Nobody else but Michelle could have written this book - it’s so MICHELLE’S STORY! She is gifted in her ability to express her own emotions- write with tremendous insight and sensitivity and from beginning to end it’s artistically rendered with meticulous attention to details. Michelle questioned herself ....was a very hard worker - determined to achieve her goals academically. She wanted to do well. No matter how great she was doing she still had insecurities - doubted herself. She questioned, “am I good enough?”MICHELLE IS GOOD ENOUGH! We are blessed to have her —- simply sharing HERSELF - BEING HERSELF - SHARING ABOUT HER LIFE - HER PARENTS - HER THOUGHTS - FEELINGS - PROJECTS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO HER....HER MARRIAGE - HER DAUGHTERS - HER FAMILY FRIENDS - BEING A WOMAN - BEING BLACK - LESSONS SHE HAS LEARNED AND IS STILL WORKING OUT - HER WARMTH -HER HUMOR- HER HONESTY & HUMANITY - etc. etc. etc. MICHELLE IS A NATURAL LEADER - A PRESENCE WE ARE DRAWN TO - CAN WE LOVE A PUBLIC FIGURE MUCH MORE? Perhaps.... but it’s very easy to love Michelle Obama ..... For me.....It would be fun just to sit with my friends over drinks and yummy treats for a few hours and all pick this book apart —- sharing our favorite parts - AS THERE ARE MANY ***FAVORITE*** parts!!!! I’m happy to host a gathering at my house anytime!!! 😊Michelle has made it clear - she is never running for office. If you listened to this audiobook for 19 hours - every word - such as I did - I guarantee you won’t doubt her ‘never running’ announcement. She will contribute her way! Politics is nasty and mean and it’s not the place for her.... she doesn’t hold back in expressing how she feels about it either. I can’t blame her. At the same time it was quite beautiful how she totally understands her husbands brilliant mind and vision - how Barack was the perfect candidate at the perfect time. Oh she would’ve rather had Obama a regular family man, but he was the type of man she herself would have wanted for President. She grew into becoming comfortable with his running.They did well overall....as husband and wife and as parents while also being in the life of politics --living in the white house with security guards everywhere they went. Michelle raised two daughters in the White House as normal as she could. A frightening story about wild sedated animals will having you saying .....“What the f#@k”? But have no fear .....the story ends well. :)Many memories came flooding back around Barack’s campaign and Election Day. I was teary eye during much of this part. Parts I remembered well - other personal circumstances that Michelle had to share about the campaign, I knew nothing about. Much made me sad and angry - Election Day had my nerves stirred all over again ... only this time I was more intimately with the Obama family. The beginning of this Audiobook.....we find Michelle at home....home alone. Not at the White House. She was no longer the First Lady. Simply a night alone in her own house. None of us readers have lived in the White House - but she shares a story that most readers will connect with. It’s priceless, moving, and powerful. I suggest taking a moment to reflect on your ‘own’ similar experience. I’m sure a memory will surface! Enjoy it. A moment of solitude. If you like cheese toast - this might be a time to have a slice. Michelle spends a long time telling us about her early childhood. I questioned ‘parts’ of this for awhile - I wasn’t sure why I needed to know sooooo many details. But - during a break from listening to the audiobook is when I did some serious reflecting. My feelings changed from feeling a little impatient - as in “how much more do I need about the family games you played in the evening, or details about kids in the neighborhood- and every description of your house - your aunt Robbie’s personality, your grandpas carpentry skills, etc. ...how much more of this Michelle?”....But then.....during my break ....( my first cry).... I understood my own and impatience . The light went off for me of why this portion of the book was valuable to me and also triggering. Michelle taught me things in this book about being black —- really being black — not just a woman and black — but what she went through all her life as a very hard working BLACK women WHO ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP REACHING - achievement oriented- her goals were important to her. Being one of the few blacks within mostly a white environment for soooo many years was a constant pressure. Her years at Princeton really shows what she went through.I learned something else from Michelle too .....Things about her ‘family’ - her parents - the tight knit ways they all were with one another - her incredible love for he older brother ..... and even though Michelle was black and lived on the south side of Chicago ..... she had things that I never had my childhood. She had two parents who were deeply dedicated to her and her brother Craig. Her parents gave up so much of their own lives to provide everything for their children. I literally fell apart with gushing tears during my break - I didn’t have a childhood anything close to hers. When I returned to listening to the Audiobook— Michelle was still talking about how wonderful her mom was and dad were, their family car - the Buick - family time *together*.....SO MUCH FAMILY TIME - HAPPY MEMORIES.....something shifted in me. I didn’t want rush her childhood any longer. I wanted to try to imagine the type SHE HAD. Once I stopped fighting my uncomfortableness - I was transforming through ‘her’ family. When Michelle hit her teenage years, I was a little envious. I wanted to be girlfriends with her. I liked her. Hanging out at her house after school - meeting her mom and those gracious sandwiches her mom prepared for Michelle and her girlfriends was just cozy wonderful. I was reminded how much I loved my close friends - Renee, Lisi, and Barbara. Great girlfriends during the teen years makes life so much more tolerable and ‘fun’. I wanted to be friends with Michelle.....feel safe in her home......cherished her mom and dad too. It was impossible not to fall in love with not only Michelle - but her parents - brother Craig - Susan ( Michelle’s best friend in college), and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, My affinity was also warm for people who supported their family in the White House. Also for Michelle’s female colleagues from her work at City Hall in Chicago ....and of course Barack Obama. Barack gets ‘guy-of-the-year’ award - the night he asked Michelle to marry her. GREAT STORY!Let’s face it ..... Barack & Michelle are adorable!! Bright - have dignity - are gracious!They undeniably love each another. They had challenges..... but as a committed couple they practiced, learn, and got better over time figuring out what empowered their relationship - and what didn’t. They were not too proud to attend therapy for support ( and Michelle was not too proud to share with the world to read). They looked for solutions - rather than attacked - found fault and blamed. Barack and Michelle are grounded in love - willing to support each individually as whole separate beings. They are also emotionally connected in matters of the heart. They may have had a challenging relationship - logistics alone - but a healthy love relationship based on respect and trust. Yep.... they are a couple much like Paul and I. ❤️Michelle and Barack’s wedding with their ‘wedding song’ by Stevie Wonder ....“You and I Can Conquer The World”.....was such a beautiful part of this story.... MY GOD....at one point I said to myself, “they really are a fairy tale couple”.....lolI usually ever even ‘think’ like that. .....but their wedding did feel beautiful.....surrounded by many people who loved them both. The only thing that would have made the wedding scene better would have been ......If on the Audiobook....they played Stevie Wonder singing the song. It’s soooo beautiful!!! Sing 🎤 along ....”You and I Can Conquer The World”. Who knows what “Willy Worm” is? Michelle mentioned she was rushing off to Willy Worm class with Sasha when she was a toddler....and I said, “what the heck is that?”... look it up....it’s cute. Might drive adults nuts, though. 🐛I loved hearing about Michelle’s high school AND college years.....Yet I felt angry ‘with’ her that years later during the Barack Obama campaign, somebody dug up an old paper that Michelle wrote when she was at Princeton as a young college student and wrote nasty things saying she was a black radical. So much UGLY news of pure crappy political lies were being spread about her during the campaign.Fox News talked about her militant anger - and she was accused of calling white people whities. Total lies - outlandish hurtful lies that exhaustive Michelle. And who could blame? All the while Michelle was trying to be positive and supportive. Michelle has contributed to other potential first ladies by writing this book. Michelle was more active than many spouses of candidates in campaigning for their husbands… But in the future we will see more of this. For over a year Michelle had zero support from the Obama campaign team. Nobody supported her. She wasn’t getting any speech writing experts. Apparently, while Michelle was campaigning - traveling from state to state - not with Obama - everything was going great until all of a sudden it wasn’t. Things turned ugly and hurtful fast. This part of the book gives useful information that others can learn from. Any future wife of a candidate running for President in the future could get an awful lot of value out of reading this portion of the shelves memoir. I’m sorry Michelle paid a painful price ....but she paved the way of possibilities to help ‘both sides’ of wives of running candidates in the future. It’s hard to finish this book without any tears. I totally love both Michelle and Barack. So many of us are heartbroken with where our country is now .....This book comes at a good time. It’s a great holiday gift! A cute moment...Michelle learned early in childhood that she could discuss things with her parents. Her parents would listen to her ideas...Even debating was allowed. She was little. She asked her mother one day, “why do we eat eggs in the morning?”That led to a discussion about the value of protein. So Michelle thought about it and did a little research and realize that peanut butter had protein. She likes Peanut butter, but she didn’t like eggs. So she was able to negotiate. For the next nine years she had a thick peanut butter sandwich every morning for breakfast and never ate an egg again. Years later a college counselor was the opposite of listening to Michelle. The woman didn’t value who she was ( a MERIT SCHOLAR - top 10% of her graduating class),..... she told Michelle she wouldn’t be “ Princeton material”. Michelle will slowly getting stronger and believing in herself.... but was definitely vulnerable and sensitive to a feeling inside of not being good enough. But that day she decided she was going to at least apply to Princeton..... she went and got her recommendation letter from a great neighbor who also worked at the school. She never talk to that counselor again....In other words she wasn’t the woman she celebrated with when she was accepted.Michelle Robinson Obama - is helping breakdown those prejudices just by speaking out - her voice is powerful - she’s more than good enough! She’s A GIFT TO OUR COUNTRY.....a woman who continues to be true to herself - making a difference being who she is .....just keep her sharing!!121!Michelle Obama won spoken-word Grammy from audiobook. Cannot wait to listen from the beginning of her fantastic life journey!OMG I couldn’t put it down! I haven’t read so many biographies or memoirs for so long but after starting that one I berated myself for procrastinating for so long to get this book into my hands. It was fascinatingly riveting, intriguing, inspirational, powerful, moving! It’s so hard to find role models in our modern world because the appearance, faking, imitation, being artificial are the main values to find some place at the upper level. (The system pushes you kiss more ass to become a winner.)Instead of being honorable first lady, Ms. Obama always attract attention with her fight for social issues even though how controversial, unconventional and challenging they were which made her iconic figure. She is unique. She loves greens, she loves to exercise, she loves to dance. She is different from the other first ladies we’ve been introduced throughout the centuries, isn’t she? I cannot imagine so of them dance with Jimmy Fallon at his late night show or play soccer team of James Corden.Let’s get a closer look st the book: It is divided into 3 main chapters: “Becoming Me” is about early childhood and family life of Obama at South Side of Chicago. Not a wealthy, easy childhood and at young age she loses her father who suffered from multiple sclerosis. But also we see her ambition, success at her school years and take a close look to her education at Princeton and Harvard Universities. Then she starts to work at Sidley Austin and meets with Mr. Barack Obama.The second part: “Becoming Us”; my favorite part of the book. Lately I read so many silly, nonsense romance books. Everything about them was extra far- fetched. But when I read something that directly captivates my heart and makes you feel for the couple, I know that I’m in the right tracks. Their love story excited me. It made me smile and sigh several times. Actually I made so many “awww” voices that my husband thought I was watching “Love Actually” for hundredth time. So yes, it was real, it melt my heart and I loved the parts about their marriage. And yes, this part also tells us Barack Obama’s political carrier and ends with the election night in 2008! Yes he was elected President of the United States.I actually liked the story about Obamas ‘ giving up the corporate law to do something meaningful. You know they can easily pay the humongous, terrifying student loans with making an impressive amount of money by working as corporate lawyers. And the final part is “Becoming More” tells us the first family life.Overall: I enjoyed this memoir. It is one of my fastest, impressing, touching readings. I loved Michelle Obama’s two quotes that really work as my life mottos which are:“Choose people who lift you up” and “Find people who will make you better”Thankfully I did. And I loved this book. I’d better read more memoirs.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter!121!""I was humbled and excited to be First Lady, but not for one second did I think I'd be sliding into some glamorous, easy role. Nobody who has the words 'first' and 'black' attached to them ever would. I stood at the foot of the mountain, knowing I'd need to climb my way into favor.""God, do I miss the Obamas.Since I've had the right to vote, two presidents have energized and excited me—Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. That's not to say that I agreed with everything they did, or that there weren't times when they disappointed me. But in both cases, their candidacy and then their campaigns for re-election motivated me enough to volunteer, excited me enough to be fraught with nerves as election results came in, gave me cause for celebration, and left me sad when their terms ended.Reading Michelle Obama's new memoir, 
Becoming
, reminded me of those times. It also reminded me just what a fan I've been of hers since watching her and her daughters when President Obama declared his candidacy for the White House almost 12 years ago, since hearing her speak at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. I was always wowed by the sheer joy she appeared to have for the job of First Lady, despite the overwhelming amount of cruelty she and her family were subjected to throughout her husband's two terms as President.With 
Becoming
, she gives you a glimpse into her childhood and her relationship with her parents, which definitely impacted the way she carried herself throughout her life and how she raised her two daughters. It tells of her ambitions, her desire to help make the world a better place (one clearly shared by her husband), the challenges of marriage and motherhood, and how she dealt with her husband's political ambitions. She talks of her desire to make an impact as First Lady while at the same time ensuring her daughters' lives were as ""normal"" as they could possibly be, and the successes, frustrations, and disappointments she experienced.I love the matter-of-fact way she shares her feelings and experiences, revealing emotions and fears and moments of anger, as well as the moments of sheer joy, as mother, as wife, as daughter, and as First Lady. While she certainly reveals instances when she felt she wasn't treated fairly by the media or by those unhappy with her husband (or her), this isn't a tell-all book. She is critical of those that deserve her scorn, but even when she didn't see eye to eye with people, she didn't tear them to pieces.For the most part, the Michelle Obama you've seen at public appearances, on television shows, and in photos, is the Michelle Obama you get in 
Becoming
. And that feels just right. This is a woman who loves her life, loves her country, and most importantly, loves her husband, her children, and her family. She doesn't overinflate her importance or her contributions as First Lady but she realizes she held a position few women have through history, and to be the first black woman to be First Lady made her a role model in the eyes of so many. It may have been a position she wasn't always comfortable with, but it is a role in which she absolutely shone.""For me, becoming isn't about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn't end. I became a mother, but I still have a lot to learn from and give to my children. I became a wife, but I continue to adapt to and be humbled by what it means to truly love and make a life with another person. I have become, by certain measures, a person of power, and yet there are moments when I still feel insecure or unheard. It's all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there's more growing to be done.""There was much to enjoy about this book, much to think about, and much to savor. And, at least for me, much to reminisce about.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html.!121!I'm surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this. I was engrossed the whole time and even teared up at some parts. Even when I wasn't reading the book, I was still thinking about Michelle Obama's story. I loved that rather than a rehashed Wiki article of her successes, this was a reflective coming-of-age story that will be inspiring to so many women and people of color who are struggling to find themselves. I loved experiencing Michelle's life alongside her with all her triumphs and heartbreaks. She gives insight not only to what her experiences were like in the White House, but also why she chose certain initiatives during her time as FLOTUS, and how her childhood and upbringing added to her perspective. I especially loved that for all the success she’s had, she always brings it back to how there are so many other kids out there possible of change who just needed the right guidance and opportunities. Her perspective is valuable and very much needed. I was moved hearing her story, and very much appreciate the reminder that even in a bleak country, there are good human beings out there.!121!Becoming, Michelle ObamaBecoming is the memoir of former United States First Lady Michelle Obama published in 2018. The book talks about her roots and how she found her voice, as well as her time in the White House, her public health campaign, and her role as a mother. The book's 24 chapters (plus a preface and epilogue) are divided into three sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More. Become Me, traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago, through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. Becoming Us, departs from the beginning of their romantic relationship and follows their marriage, the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States. Becoming More, describes their life as First Family.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «شدن»؛ «میشل اوباما شدن»؛ «خاطرات بانوی اول شدن»؛ «میشل شدن»؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و یکم ماه آوریل سال 2019میلادی؛ کتاب را بار دیگر نیز خواندم روز چهارم ماه آگوست سال 2019میلادی به پایان رسیدعنوان: میشل اوباما شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: سپیده حبیبی؛ تهران، موسسه نگارش الکترونیک کتاب، 1397؛ در 580ص؛ شابک9786008299868 موضوع: زیستنامه میشل رابینسون اوباما - 1964میلادی - همسر ریاست جمهوری ایالات متحده آمریکا - روسای جمهور، از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: علی سلامی؛ ویراستار: مهدی سجودی مقدم؛ تهران، مهراندیش؛ چاپ بیست و پنجم 1397؛ در 518ص؛ تصویر، مصور؛ عکس؛ شابک 9786006395715؛ فروست تاریخ و سیاست، 18؛ عنوان دیگر میشل اوباما شدن؛ موضوع زیستنامه میشل رابینسون اوباما - 1964میلادی - همسر ریاست جمهوری امریکا - روسای جمهور، ایالات متحده - سده 21معنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم سعید دوج؛ تهران، روزگار، 1397، در 561ص؛ شابک 9789643748869؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: فرزانه فیروزکوهی؛ تهران، کوله پشتی، 1397، در 460ص؛ شابک 9786004612272؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: حمیدرضا بلوچ؛ تهران، علوم آریا، 1397، در 512ص؛ شابک 9786009855773؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: علیرضا بهنام؛ تهران، سرزمین اهورایی، 1397، در 600ص؛ شابک 9786009882304؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: کابک خبیری؛ با همکاری مارال دربندی؛ تهران، انتشارات اسحق، 1397، در 400ص؛ شابک 9786008175513؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: مهری مدآبادی؛ تهران، هورمزد، 1397، در 700ص؛ شابک 9786226010610؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: سوده احمدی مقدم؛ احسان عبدالباقی؛ مشهد، سیمرغ خراسان، سایلان، 1397، در 220ص؛ شابک 9786226115308؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: مهراب حسنوند؛ تهران، آسو، 1397، در 460ص؛ شابک 9786008755616؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: موسسه ترجمیتو؛ ویراستار: نغمه علیقلی؛ تهران، تیموری، 1398، در 576ص؛ شابک 9786006629414؛عنوان: میشل اوباما شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: کیوان سپهری؛ تهران، نحل، 1397، در 480ص؛ شابک 9786226092074؛عنوان: میشل اوباما؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: بهناز امانی؛ تهران، ماهریس، 1397، در 295ص؛ شابک 9786009929337؛عنوان: میشل شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: رضا اسکندری آذر؛ تهران، انتشارات خوب، 1397، در 488ص؛ شابک: 9786226513647؛عنوان: میشل شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: سودابه قیصری؛ تهران، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر پارسه، 1397، در 517ص؛ شابک 9786002534361؛عنوان: شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: هاجر شکری؛ امان الله ارغوان؛ بجنورد، در قلم، 1397، در 496ص؛ شابک 9786226372077؛عنوان: خاطرات بانوی اول شدن؛ نویسنده: میشل اوباما؛ مترجم: خدیجه صفایی؛ تهران، نشر گویا ، 1398، در 640ص؛ شابک 9786226528177؛نقل از مقدمه: «آنگاه که بچه بودم، آرزوهایم ساده بودند، دلم میخواست یک سگ داشته باشم؛ دلم میخواست خانه ای داشته باشم، که داخلش پله باشد - دو طبقه، برای یک خانواده؛ به دلیلی نامشخص، دلم میخواست به جای یک اتومبیل «بیوک» دو در، که باعث شادی و مباهات پدرم بود، یک «استیشن واگن چهار در» داشته باشم؛ عادت داشتم به همه بگویم: وقتی بزرگ شدم، دلم میخواهد پزشک اطفال شوم؛ چون عاشق این بودم که دور و بر بچه های کوچک باشم»؛ پایان نقل از پیش درآمدبانو «میشل رابینسون اوباما»، زاده ی سال 1964میلادی، در «شیکاگو»؛ وکیل، کنشگر اجتماعی، نویسنده، و نخستین بانوی نخست آمریکایی - آفریقایی، در تاریخ «ایالات متحده آمریکا»، هستند؛ بانو «میشل اوباما»، دانش آموخته ی دانشگاه «پرینستون»، و دارای درجه ی دکترای حقوق، از دانشگاه «هاروارد»، هستند؛ «شدن»، روایتی از زندگی شخصی، خانم «اوباما»، همسر نخستین رئیس جمهور سیاه پوست آمریکا، پیش، و پس از ورود به «کاخ سفید» است، بانوی نخست رئیس جمهور پیشین ایالت متحده ی آمریکا، در این کتاب، با سود بردن از شیوه ی روایی، و دوستانه، خوانشگر را به دنیای خویش فرامیخوانند؛ و آموخته هایی را بازگو میکنند، که سازنده ی شخصیت ایشان بوده است؛ از دوران کودکانگی (کودکیها)، در محله ی فقیرنشین «شیکاگو»، تا روزی که «بانوی نخست» ایالات متحده ی آمریکا، شدند، سخن میگویند؛ سرگذشت، و زیستنامه ی زنی، همسری، و مادری ست، که گام به گام، با دشواریهای زندگی، روبرو میشوند، و با «تلاش»، «شکیبائی»، «تدبیر»، و «ایستادگی»، چشم به آینده ای روشن، و تابناک میدوزند، و در برابر بن بستهای «طبیعی»، «اجتماعی»، و «نژادی»، هرگزی سر خم نمیکنند، و رام نمیشوندنقل از متن: «اگر تنها یک چیز در زندگی آموخته باشم، توان سودبردن از کلام است، نهایت تلاشم ��ا کردم، که سخن راستین را بگویم، و مسائلی را بازگو کنم که دیگران همگی آنها را نادیده میگیرند»؛ یایان نقل از متنتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 04/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺

Becoming
 is the complex road Life chose for Michelle to go to and the story of how she became who she is now: a woman of integrity, loved by so many and who inspires towards kind purposes in life. Michelle is a superhero of a nation. But she is just so much more than that. She is a normal person with normal habits, dreams and aspirations, with a ludic nature and a nice sense of humour. She's a fabulous mother to her daughters, a fabulous wife and friend to her husband, a fabulous daughter to her parents. Michelle Obama inspires. Maybe she doesn’t realise it. Or maybe she does. She talks about things that bother her, raising an alarm to the rest of the world. Talking about racism, feminism, health issues, poverty, even peace, Michelle inspires with her words because if she likes it or not, her words weigh. I take off my hat for this incredible, real-life Wonder Woman and I take the liberty to say only this: even though I have no direct connection whatsoever with anything this woman has ever done in her life, I just feel the need to say THANK YOU MICHELLE LAVAUGHN ROBINSON OBAMA FOR EVERYTHING YOU’VE DONE FOR THIS WORLD AND THANK YOU FOR INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION! Thank you for inspiring me. I owe you one in heaven (supposing that I even get there LOL). (x)!121!I just finished this PHENOMENAL book–seriously, probably THE best autobiography I’ve ever laid my hands on! It’s now in vogue–the coolest new trend–for people to write a book about their lives, and I respect that trend for allowing us to read more TRUE, REAL stories about REAL people. BUT, Becoming is the first autobiography I’ve ever felt I’ve truly connected with, learned from and became a better person for having read it. Within these pages, I both saw myself and re-found myself within Michelle Obama’s narrative; I saw myself in her story and have truly learned a few life changing lessons from this 421-page journey she’s shared with us. It is a rare thing, indeed, for me to be able to say that about any book—that I identified with the words, felt the words in a heartfelt way and came away changed because of those series of words on a page that had been so thoughtfully and candidly laid out. I had the honor of going to see Michelle Obama on her book tour at her Washington D.C. stop the Sunday after Thanksgiving. (In an ironic full circle of events in my experience with this book, I went to see her speak with a friend I met here on Goodreads who has become a very close friend of mine.) Michelle Obama was…everything. She was witty and frankly hilarious; she was open and forthright; she was graceful and dignified, a true orator and inspiration.The tickets to this event sold out within hours--a completely filled arena, pictured above as it is starting to fill.Both in her book and in her talks, she speaks openly about what it was like to be a young black girl from the South Side of Chicago—during the time when whites were fleeing the area and poverty seemed to be creeping its way in—to becoming a young woman at Princeton, unsure of her footing in the new social climate but still clinging to her rigidly drawn-up plan and schedule for her life (of which becoming First Lady was never a part).I’d constructed my existence carefully, tucking and folding every loose and disorderly bit of it…I had labored over its creation. I was proud of how it looked. But it was delicate. If one corner came untucked, I might discover that I was restless. If another popped loose, it might reveal I was uncertain about the professional path I’d so deliberately put myself on, about all the things I told myself I wanted.She walks us through graduating from college and enduring the loss of one of her best friends to an aggressive cancer at the young age of 26 years old and how this changed her outlook on the world and her path through it. Within these pages you’ll learn how she first met Barack Obama, a man who would change her world and ours in so many ways—how he arrived at work late that first day she was to mentor him, wet from the rainy day outside but still sure of himself and confident in a way that spoke of humility. From IVF to being a senator’s wife to the horrible shock of how dirty and personal politics can turn, Michelle Obama gives us an insightful glimpse into her journey into and out of the White House, her personal trek into becoming the icon she is today—a label she still humbly finds bewildering but that she has learned to hone for the betterment of our nation and the society-focused programs she has championed.Throughout it all, Michelle Obama’s outlook is optimistic, her voice clear, witty, candid and insightful. How did she feel the first time she experienced life inside of the presidential motorcade? What fears did she have of exposing her daughters to the “maw” of public life? And how did she accommodate her outlook on politics –I’ve never been a fan of politics, and my experience over the last ten years has done little to change that. I continue to be put off by the nastiness—the tribal segregation of red and blue, this idea that we’re supposed to choose one side and stick to it, unable to listen and compromise, or sometimes even to be civil.–and her negative experience within the whirlwind of it—A Fox news chyron referred to me as “Obama’s Baby Mama,” conjuring cliched notions of black-ghetto America, implying an otherness that put me outside even my own marriage. I was getting worn out, not physically, but emotionally. The punches hurt, even if I understood that they had little to do with who I really was as a person. It was as if there were some cartoon version of me out there wreaking havoc, a woman I kept hearing about but didn’t know—a too-tall, too-forceful, ready-to-emasculate Godzilla of a political wife named Michelle Obama.–to achieve what she has, and with such grace, for our nation, the Democratic party, for children and for people (girls and women especially) of color?Just as the discerning look at the viciousness of American politics will enrage you and make you question the leaders we’ve elected to power, so will Michelle Obama’s experience with the other side of her First Lady journey, the experience with the purity of spirit of genuinely good people—no matter their political affiliations, nationality or socio-economic status—move you.One day in San Antonio, Texas, I noticed a minor commotion in the hallway of the military hospital I was visiting. Nurses shuffled urgently in and out of the room I was about to enter. “He won’t stay in bed,” I heard someone whisper. Inside, I found a broad-shouldered young man from rural Texas who had multiple injuries and whose body had been severely burned. He was in clear agony, tearing off the bedsheets and trying to slide his feet to the floor. It took us all a minute to understand what he was doing. Despite his pain, he was trying to stand up and salute the wife of his commander in chief.As I read Becoming, I HAD to read it with a pen and highlighter in hand, hence why it took me so long to complete it. I had to savor every word, go back and re-read passages. Just today, as I was nearing the epilogue, a woman sitting next to me asked, “What are you studying?” I turned the book over and told her, “Michelle Obama’s Becoming.” I hope that gives you an idea of the intensity and connection with which I read this book. To say that I highly recommend this book to any and everyone—especially to American women, women of color and people who have felt persecuted or “othered” by their upbringings or the color of their skin—would be a clear understatement. There is so much truth and integrity and raw emotion to be pointed out in this autobiography, but to do so here would be to write a whole book about the marvels of this book. What I will say is that Becoming earned an easy 5 stars before I’d even finished the preface and continued in its discerning excellence thereafter. There is truly something within these pages for everyone because, as Michelle Obama so elegantly states:I’m an ordinary person who found herself on an extraordinary journey. In sharing my story, I hope to help create space for other stories and other voices, to widen the pathway for who belongs and why…It’s not about being perfect. It’s not about where you get yourself in the end. There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.

Only fans of M.O. could possibly like this book as it doesn't stick to facts. They are the only ones allowed to give reviews of it. I wonder what is being said about Trump books? My review has been deleted twice. Hopefully I am allowed to say this little bit.!121!This isn’t so much a review as it is a tiny opportunity to thank the book gods for all the opportunities reading and books have given me. Getting to meet and share time with Michelle Obama was one of the craziest highlights of my professional life and speeding through this book to finish it in time will always be one of the funniest reading experiences I’ve ever had. 🙌🏼!121!4,5 estrellas, solo porque hubo partes que me parecieron innecesarias (?), pero en general lo AMÉ. Le tenía miedo porque es larguísimo (el audiolibro dura 19 horas), pero conforme más avanzaba, MENOS QUERÍA QUE SE ACABARA.!121!Whatever was coming next, this was a story we could own.
What an extraordinary and formidable undertaking it must have been, to be the one standing next to the first black President of the United States. And it was made all the more so because Michelle Obama was scrutinized and held to a bar far higher than any previous First Lady. And yet, she came through it with grace, intelligence, and humor, and in the process, inspired an entire generation of women and people of color, including me.Becoming feels like I'm not just reading the words of one woman's incredible journey from lower middle class to being one of the most respected women of our time, but also the potential story of what could be for so many women of color. Michelle makes clear that her life was able to take its remarkable trajectory in large part due to the influence of her parents, extended family, teachers, and mentors, who all loved and invested in her through her crucial formative years.Reading this, I'm struck by how honest and forthright she is. She is open with all the difficulties and struggles she has gone through, both public and personal. She talks about how she tries to balance her drive for a career in public service with her husband's political calling, all while raising two young children. It must have been extraordinarily challenging, yet she handled it all with enviable poise.One of the things I most enjoyed about this book is its message of optimism and hope. She's incredibly resilient and driven, even in the face of so much opposition, criticism, and disparagement of herself and her family. She accomplished so much during her time as First Lady, and reading her words in this memoir is a true inspiration.Michelle Obama encompasses all that I admire: authenticity, kindness, and resilience. And this book is not just a candid self-reflection, but also a hopeful call for us all that we can do better and can achieve anything we put our minds to, as long as we aren't afraid of hard work.I'm so glad I picked up this memoir of a truly exceptional woman. There's a lot in here to digest, and I will be taking the time to think over all that I've read in the coming weeks and months. I know her words will stay with me for a long time.!121!Absolutely stunning in every possible way. I hope Michelle is having a good day 😭!121!5 Extremely Poignant Stars for “Becoming”When I think of Michelle Obama, the words that come to mind are: Grace Personified. She exemplifies all of the qualities I admire most: beauty, elegance, honor, kindness, intelligence and dignity. To say that I miss the Obamas is an understatement. Going into this read, I knew I would be emotional.  Truth be told, that didn’t begin to describe my reaction to hearing Michelle Obama’s words, her thoughts and learning about her, a good portion of which I’m ashamed to admit, I didn’t know. The former first lady’s humble beginnings, her close knit family, her education and her accomplishments, they simply blew me away. Princeton, Harvard, working at and forming Non-Profits (not to mention her accomplishments as the First Lady!): I am awestruck by you Michelle Obama. The moment Michelle meets Barack Obama when he summers at Sidney Austin, the law firm she is an Associate at, she feels it. That spark. My eyes filled, they glossed over, the tears fell. The two shared an ice cream cone and became an us. (Here, listening to this, I admit to sobbing, heavily). The inflection and enthusiasm in Michelle Obama’s voice, her feelings of love for this man, it is so evident. We saw them every day for 8 years. Such sweet romance, pure pure love and complete respect for each other and their relationship. Oh how I love them. Oh how I miss them.From life in politics, campaigning, being bullied, becoming the First Lady and raising Malia and Sasha in the White House, Michelle Obama gives an honest portrayal of what life was like for her and Barack Obama. While in the White House, the President always made time for family. Always having dinner with them. Never discussing politics. Family was their bond. Yet his love for this Nation was and is still evident.There were so many moments while listening to this audiobook that I teared up. Not just teared up, but sobbed uncontrollably.  Her words, her voice, her thoughts struck a chord, for a myriad of reasons, some sad, some happy. I tear up just thinking about them. Michelle Obama memoir is about “Becoming” - her life’s journey, the amazing part of course, is that it never ends. Her final message is one of hope, of letting people in, and helping others. I received it. Thank you to Michelle Obama for sharing your life with us. I am honored. Published on Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 12.8.18.Excerpt to be published on Instagram.!121!I don't know what happened but I really did not connect with Michelle Obama while reading this book. I ended up skipping a lot of paragraphs, reading through it and would have probably not ended my reading of Becoming if it had been written by any other person in the world.I really wanted to love that book. I pre-ordered it and was waiting for it with anticipation. I like Michelle Obama, I think she is an amazing strong woman and I wanted to read why she was all that. I still believe she is an amazing strong woman, but I still don't feel like I really know why. I know how. The book was filled with details and facts and anecdotes, that's not the issue, I actually would have edited out some of it if it had been my decision, I felt it was to detailed at times.The issue, to me, was that it felt more like a biography than an autobiography. A lot of how : facts, anecdotes, memories, but not a lot of why : analysis, opinions... Michelle Obama is a really good writer, and she tells us how she felt at times but... I don't know. Maybe it was a little to polished ? A little too clean ? Even when she talked about anger, it felt like ""light anger"", like okay anger. Even when she talked about marriage issues or about the death of her friend at a young age, it felt... It felt like she had a lot of distance, like she talked about someone's else life... I now know a lot of things about Michelle Obama and her family, her friends, her husband, her daughters, her life in the White House... But it all feels more like historical facts or a very long article written about her than her own thoughts. I'm really disappointed by this, eventhough this book is still a good book, I get why people love it so much. It's just it was not what I wanted it to be.!121!MIND BLOWN!!While I admit to being a reading fiend when it comes to politics, as some will no doubt have realised, I also find much pleasure in learning about people through biographies and memoirs. Knowing full well that I would be swept up in the wave that surrounded the recent release of Michelle Obama’s memoirs, I vowed to take some time to read them, partially to offset some of the alarming pieces about current events in DC. Obama seeks not to define herself as FLOTUS (First Lady of the United States), but rather Michelle Obama (née Robinson), taking the reader as far back as she can remember. Obama sets the stage for the reader with a solid recounting of her life on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1960s. In an era rattled by race wars, she remembers her parents forced to pinch pennies and living with relatives, while the world around them tried to come to terms with racial integration. Working hard in school and always striving to excel, Obama remembers gaining a spot at Princeton, where her older brother was already attending. There, she learned the power of community and helping others, a theme that repeats itself throughout the memoir. After leapfrogging into Harvard Law School—again, through hard work and merit—Obama was able to settle back in Chicago at a law firm. Here, she met an ever-tardy and somewhat esoteric Barrack Hussein Obama, whose basic living was something to which Michelle could relate, though they clashed considerably in their approaches to organization. Barrack and Michelle soon began a courtship that led to marriage and the introduction of politics into the equation. Barrack was a community organiser who was being touted for more, first a State Senate seat and then all the way to Congress. While Michelle was never fond of the political arena, she argues throughout the middle of the memoir about how she could never stand in the way of her husband’s ambitions. The Obamas welcomed two girls into their lives, doubling the size of their family and bringing new meaning to work ethic. Michelle struggled with this, as well as being a wife/mother while her husband was away a great deal, though the reader will see much change throughout, as the girls got older. The last great transformation for Michelle was her husband’s choice to seek the White House. If she struggled before, the campaign showed her new issues and concerns, as exhibited through a number of lenses. The Obamas worked hard and utilised their fresh message approach to reach the political pinnacle, but that was only the beginning. In wonderfully fluid narratives, Michelle Obama depicts life inside the White House and roles of the First Family, inviting the reader to explore some of her most personal thoughts as initiatives, bills, summits, and security decisions shaped America at break-neck speed. Even when the time came to leave, Michelle refused to turn off and fade into the background, arguing that there was still much life to live, as can be seen with the publication of this book. Stunning in its frankness and refusal to shrink out of sight, Michelle Obama offers readers a refreshing look at a woman’s life who was shaped by her life experiences, but refused to be defined by the man who stood beside her. Recommended for those who love memoirs, politics, coming of age, and anything uplifting, which is sure to offset much of the sludge that Washington is spewing out these days!There have been many notable First Ladies in the last number of years, all of whom left their own marks on America. However, I can think of only one who stood out and sought to define herself independent of the role her husband brought as President of the United States. That thought came to mind before I began this book, though now that I am on the flip side, I can see that Michelle Obama was more than ‘wife of’, but rather a woman of great importance in her own regard. Michelle Obama refuses—throughout and in many scenarios—to allow herself to be defined as simply a member of a group. She is not just a woman, an African American, a mother, a First Lady. This memoir catapulted many of the views I had of Obama and helped me see the woman who sought to fight for equality years before she made headlines, who advocated for others decades before healthy snacks in schools became an initiative, and who loved life to its fullest before being thrust before the cameras. In essence, Michelle Obama became many things on her life journey, hence the aptly chosen title. As the memoir argues so effectively, there was more to the woman than being a spouse and mother, tending house while Barrack Obama rose to power. Without Michelle, there would have been no winning campaigns, but not because she stumped or smiled for the cameras. It was her passion and dedication to the kernel of the Obama family that saw these four people become firsts in many things and helped America realise its greatness. Being able to tear down walls, rather than build them; communicate passionately, rather than attack venomously, Michelle Obama forged the cornerstone of the legacy she wishes to leave the world. Let it never be forgotten that beside every decent man is a fundamentally stupendous woman and the brilliance of the words in this book give new meaning to this. When I speak of brilliance and earth-shattering aspects of this memoir, I refer not only to the wonderful prose and sound vignettes that rise from page upon page, but also the shards left to twinkle in the sunlight, as the reader notices just how many glass ceilings Michelle Obama was able to break in her life, paving the way for other women to follow her.Kudos, Madam Obama, for one of the most enthralling memoirs I have read in a long time. I am stunned, in awe, and so happy I took the time to get to know you better. Thank you for making the world a better place by being an active part of it!Like/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at: http://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/A Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge: https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...!121!4.5 stars!!I’ve had Becoming pre-ordered since I saw it was coming out. I was so excited to read it. Per my Amazon account, I purchased The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama in early 2007. When I read this book, I was moved and hoped this man would be president one day. When I was in my early 20’s, I volunteered for his 2008 campaign. My point is, I’ve always loved the Obamas, but I never knew much about Michelle. After reading this book, I feel like I know so much more. Her story is inspiring, fascinating, and I adore her.If you’re going to read this book, I can’t recommend the audio book enough. Michelle herself narrates it and I always love when authors narrate their own stories. It makes them that more personal and captivating. I loved reading about her past, her family, and of course when she met Barack and their story. I could relate to some of her story and learned a lot of new things about her. This was a fantastic autobiography and I can’t recommend it enough!!121!Michelle Obama Give Me A Hug And Tell Me Everything Is Going To Be Okay 2k19.One of my greatest wishes is for the entirety of my thought process to be narrated - if not controlled - by Michelle Obama. But apparently that isn’t “a thing that can happen,” and “even if it was it’d be creepy and in many ways morally wrong,” and “seriously Emma how do these ideas even occur to you, it’s worrying, stop.”So I did the next best thing and listened to this audiobook.18 HOURS OF MICHELLE OBAMA’S VOICE!!I don’t even LIKE audiobooks (shockingly - I like books and I like podcasts so I’m not sure what’s holding me back), and still I’m aware that the fact of the matter here is this: If you read this instead of listening to the audiobook, you’re getting played.Because the only thing better than reading 426 pages of Michelle Obama writing about herself is listening to 18 hours of her talking about herself.A complete dream.Bottom line: I could rant about my love for Michelle Obama for 426 pages, but that would be weird. (If this weren’t weird enough already.)------------starting a petition for michelle obama to give me a hugreview to come / 4.5 stars------------i want michelle obama to be in charge of everything, including my entire life.however that appears to not be """"""possible"""""" so i'm going to listen to her talk for 18 hours instead!121!You bet your ass I just preordered this. As a female minority, Queen First Lady Michelle Obama has become one of my most go-to role models, and I already know I'm going to be in tears while reading this.!121!Becoming like Michelle Obama herself, is both eloquent and relatable. She talks about becoming her, becoming us, and finally, becoming more. As most of us know by now, Michelle is from Chicago, grew up with loving and supportive parents, attended Princeton followed by Harvard for law school, then began her position as an associate at the prestigious law firm of Sidley Austin, where she eventually met Barack. My favorite section of the book was by far, Becoming Us, in which Michelle describes meeting Barack and the evolvement of their relationship. Michelle does not pretend living in the White House was not a privilege or shy away from the associated perks. She doesn’t pretend it was always amazing and wonderful either. There were plenty of tough days with the various events happening around the world. The pressure and scrutiny of trying to raise 2 daughters with some semblance of normalcy could also be taxing on the family of 4. Through it all, Michelle always remained committed to being the best mom to Sasha and Malia. The nostalgia and longing for the former Obama reign in the White House, was, as I read this memoir, and is, still real. The Obamas are admirable not just for their smart talents but also their continued relatability. They are genuine people who want more for their kids, for their country, and just doing their part to contribute to this goal. A tad oversimplified? Maybe, but if it’s not clear yet, I’m a huge fan. ”For me, becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it more as a forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to continuously reach toward a better self. The journey doesn’t end. I became a mother, but I still have a lot to learn from and give to my children. I became a wife, but I continue to adapt to and be humbled by what it means to truly love and make a life with another person. I have become, by certain measures, a person of power, and yet there are still moments when I feel insecure or unheard. It’s all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there’s more growing up to be done.“Highly recommend Becoming for fans Michelle, Barack, and the Obama administration.!121!MonumentalMichelle Obama’s book, Becoming, is a refreshingly honest and fascinating insight into the major decisions, challenges and events in her life. This left me with even more respect and admiration for her and Barak. It provides wonderful coverage of her thinking and actions through life, from childhood to lawyer, to wife and mother, and to First Lady.Michelle’s background in the South Shore neighbourhood in Chicago is openly chronicled to the reader and shows a person shaped by her hardworking and loving family, a father that grafted every single day at the water filtration plant, even with multiple sclerosis making it difficult to walk. The foundations of her determination and her devotion to her own family with Barak were rooted deeply during those early years. Her telling of losing family and friends is just heartbreaking, more because she goes beyond loss, and ties it to the gift of life, and life’s lessons.After meeting Barak and establishing a loving relationship, Michelle recognised his vision and drive, which led her to question her own highly paid legal career. She would seek something that would give her a similar meaning and purpose. Something that would go well beyond the need to secure a higher and higher salary. She changed jobs, taking massive pay cuts to find that purpose and contribution to society. She worked for non-profits, City Hall, healthcare and academia, so she could make an impact where it mattered, to heal divisions and disparities.What has inspired me most about Michelle and Barak is that they give a sense of possibility to ordinary people. A possibility that doesn’t require sacrificing everything for that single self-centred goal. We can strive for a life of balance, a balance between family and career, between self-need and freely giving, and between reality and dreams. The realm of politics is very strange and I have often held a thought that anyone determined to be in politics should be enough reason for them not to be elected. Those thoughts played on Michelle’s mind as she watched Barak become drawn into that manipulative and dishonest world. While ultimately providing all the support she could to her husband's mission, she was steadfast in keeping her focus on family needs. There are slips along the way but with careful and honest reflection, she grounds the family again and prevents the glamour of their position affecting her family values. 
“I was a full-time mother and wife now, albeit a wife with a cause and a mother who wanted to guard her kids against getting swallowed by that cause.”
This book provides a unique perspective on the greatest political achievement for many decades in the US. The achievement that working-class people can further their education, their careers and their dreams to the pinnacle of ambition. What caught the imagination of the world was that Barak Obama would not only become the USA’s first black president but would disregard the supposition that only money families could achieve such a high office.Of course, this book is inspirational, but it is also the manner in which it was achieved that inspired people worldwide. Michelle pays such heartfelt devotion and praise to her husband’s role and gives another lens on his achievements. Barak’s views came from a place of inclusion, positivity, caring, principles and hard work. Compare that with what we see today, not only in the US but globally. He also had a natural ability to engage people and inspire possibilities. 
“Barack looked out at the audience and into the TV cameras, and as if kick-starting some internal engine, he just smiled and began to roll. He spoke for seventeen minutes that night, explaining who he was and where he came from.”…“The media response to Barack’s speech was hyperbolic. “I’ve just seen the first black president,” Chris Matthews declared to his fellow commentators on NBC.”
Michelle’s life as First Lady illustrates how serious she took the role and how she used it to tackle issues that were important to her, such as the families of service personnel, and the education rights for girls, while also remaining resolute in maintaining a regular family life that they would return to when the presidency terms were over. She is a lady of utmost intelligence and dignity, with a strong moral focus. Pity, she won’t ever run for President - we'll see.I felt the book revealed more than I was expecting, however, it wasn’t a tell-all account and provided the perfect balance between factual insight and titillating gossip. The book created a captivating and enthralling story, deeply moving at times, and with a conviction to keep family and friends’ secrets private.I listened to the audiobook version so I could take the opportunity of hearing Michelle Obama’s story in her own eloquent words. The narration feels deeply moving and personal and on the many emotional events in her life, it becomes so touching that you are totally enchanted in the little bubble that now surrounds you.This is a book I highly recommend it and really worth reading or my preference, listening to.!121!i’ve been crying for like 3 hours lol","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir']"
"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America (Hardcover)",Erik Larson,4.0,678354,2003,"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous ""White City"" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe","Poor Erik Larson.He wanted to write an extensive, in-depth look at the 1893 World's Fair, which was a collaboration of some of the greatest creative minds in the country (including the guy who designed the Flatiron building in New York and Walt Disney's dad) and gave us, among other things, the Ferris Wheel, the zipper, shredded wheat, and Columbus Day. The entire venture was almost a disaster, with delays, petty fighting, bad weather, and more delays, but it was ultimately a massive success and helped make the city of Chicago what it is today. Here's what it must have looked like when Larson pitched his idea for the book:Larson: ""And the fair didn't go flawlessly - towards the end of the fair, the mayor of Chicago was assassinated by a crazy guy, and there were tons of disappearances over the course of the fair, and a lot of them were probably the work of this serial killer who had opened a hotel near the fairgrounds - Editor: ""Wait, serial killer? And it's connected to the fair? Cool, let's try to include that in the book. Also the crazy assassin sounds good, too.""Larson: ""No, the killer - H.H. Holmes - really wasn't connected to the fair at all. I mean, he used the fair as a way to collect victims, but he would have killed tons of people even without it. In fact, after the fair he moved on and kept murdering people, so the fair really didn't have any effect on his methods...""Editor: ""Doesn't matter! How about you alternate between chapters about the fair and chapters about Holmes killing people?""Larson: ""But I don't really know much about that. Nobody does - Holmes never admitted to killing all those people, even after the police found human remains in his basement. I don't really know any actual details about the killings.""Editor: ""That's okay, you can just make it up. I'll give you some trashy crime novels to read, that'll give you some ideas. Now tell me more about the assassination.""Larson: ""He was just some mentally unbalanced person who thought he deserved a position in the mayor's office and shot the guy when he realized it wasn't going to happen. But the death cast a pall over the entire closing ceremony of the fair, and it - ""Editor: ""Good, let's sprinkle in some bits about the crazy guy throughout the book, too. Now, back to Holmes: did he maybe kill somebody at the fair, or did they find a body on the grounds or something?""Larson: ""No, the Chicago police didn't even notice anything was happening. It wasn't until he left Chicago that a detective from another state tracked him down.""Editor: ""Okay, so we'll make the end of the book about the manhunt for Holmes and his capture.""Larson: ""What does any of this have to do with the World's Fair?""Editor: ""Hell if I know. You're the writer, not me - you figure it out. Here's a check. Now go make me a bestseller!""Four stars for the World's Fair stuff, two stars for the pulpy unrelated bullshit.!121!This book is two, two, two books in one!Sorry, that was annoying. But it’s almost as if Erik Larson wrote two really short books—one about the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and another about the murder spree of Dr. H. H. Holmes—and then shoved them together to create a single story. The result isn’t bad, and I think Larson is successful at maintaining clean seams between the two narratives, but it’s hard to argue these two occurrences are anything but abstractedly related. Yes, Holmes lived in Chicago at the time of the fair and lured a bunch of people to his murder castle (he be snatchin’ yo’ people up!), but the events didn’t weigh heavily on the fair itself or on the atmosphere surrounding it. No alarm bells went off anywhere in Chicago as a result of his, um, unsavory indiscretions.Still, there is a lot of interesting stuff here, information specific to the world’s fair, and it is fun to learn new things. For example, the Chicago Columbian Exposition exudes a long list of firsts: it saw the invention of the world’s first ferris wheel, it led the nation in its first public observance of the Pledge of Allegiance, and it helped to establish alternating current as the industry standard for electricity distribution. Even that awful snake charmer song has its origins in the Chicago World’s Fair.

While writing this review, I’ve come to learn that Leonardo DiCaprio, that beautiful man with the screaming cherry tomato head on a toothpick body, is producing the film adaptation, and will also play the role of serial killer H. H. Holmes.

The Written Review
Overwhelmingly underwhelming 1893 was a year to remember - the World's Fair came to Chicago and H. H. Holmes (one of America's most famous serial killers) took full advantage. He stalked the streets and murdered whomever he pleased.I really liked the idea of this one - to take one of America's greatest triumphs and splicing his story along with one of the greatest horrors. However. There's too high of a disconnect between these two sides This reads like two separate books thrown together at inopportune moments - as soon one half got the least bit exciting, we'd swap. It was frustrating and ultimately exasperating to read. The World Fair section was interesting in its own right, but it  paled so much in comparison to the serial killer that it became something to slog through. For the World's Fair - we see the entirety of its creation and eventual destruction. Ample page space was given to dissecting every. single. mind-numbing. detail.Roughly half the book was wasted on petty squabbles about the building paint, boats in the harbor and the landscaping. (I finally understand how my mother can fall asleep while reading.) Then, once I nodded off between 2-3 times, we'd jump to the insane murderer. But, there was a huge disconnect regarding page space. The longer the book went on, the shorter those H. H. Holmes sections would be - towards the end, we'd only get we'd get 1 to 10 pages from H. H. Holmes' perspective for every couple chapters of building plans. Fabulous.The two main stories weren't entirely separate - they did tangentially intersect - notably H. H. Holmes managed to lure so many people into his hotel  because of the fair and he  did  take one of his victims to the fair but those connections did not seem strong enough for a joint book.While I appreciate the time and effort it took to research such a complete account of 1893, I had a hard time enjoying the novel. It felt like more of a mess than anything.Popsugar 2018 Reading Challenge: A book you meant to read in 2017 but didn't get toYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!So, no offense to those that liked this book, but I'm throwing in the towel after 75 pages. It's just not holding my interest. Part of the reason for this is that Larson's writing style is way too speculative for my taste in non-fiction. I just finished reading  the Path Between Seas by David McCullough, and he does such an amazing job of making complicated, historical events interesting, without fabricating scenes that ""could have"" happened. Even that wouldn't have bothered me that much if Larson had said something more like, ""It's likely he did this, since we know this about his personality"" or whatever, rather than ""He reached out and touched her hand as he spoke to her."" There was no clear distinction between what definitely happened, and what maybe could have happened. That got bothersome.I could have just ignored the non-fiction aspect and enjoyed the story, if not for Larson's habit of getting bogged down in inconsequential details. He seemed to throw facts (or conjectured facts) in whenever the fancy struck him, rather than keeping the story moving.And finally, I got annoyed with the jumping back and forth between Holmes's story and the architecture/Worlds Fair story. Just when I'd get into one, we'd switch to the other. He could have done a better job of interweaving those.So, since my curiosity is piqued, but not enough to continue reading this book, I'm just going to do some Wikipedia reading and call it good.!121!Humour me and please allow the channeling an eighth grader for just a moment. OMG Squeee!!1 Teh best!! (Would an eighth grader say ""teh best""?) And now we return you to our regularly scheduled review.I'm not a huge fan of non-fiction. Scratch that. I'm a huge fan of non-fiction, but not so huge a fan of reading non-fiction. While I appreciate learning and broadening my understanding of the world around and as it once was, I find myself pretty quickly distracted from whatever non-fictional work I pick up. The fact is: most writers of non-fiction are more experts in their field of study than they are expert authors. They deliver the goods well, but aren't quite as adept at prettying them up for consumption.Erik Larson, however, is a genius. Or something. I could not put this book down. (In the figurative sense—it actually took me about two weeks to read.) The entire length of my time in this book was marked with moments of in which I would stop reading, interrupt my wife from the depths of her studies, and remark again how good this book was. (I'm sure that she would have been happier had Larson just been your average purveyor of non-fictionalizations.)In The Devil in the White City, Larson chronicles chiefly a tale of two city-dwellers. Architect, Daniel Burnham and pharmacist, Henry Holmes. One would helm the creation of a wonderland of awe-striking beauty and refinement. The other would become one of America's earliest and most diabolical serial killers. All this against the backdrop of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (a.k.a. the Chicago World's Fair).Daniel Burnham, the self-made architect, who designed the Rookery in Chicago would design the Flatiron Building in New York, assembled a team of the best American architects of the day for the task of crafting a World's Fair in Chicago that would be even more exquisite than the one held in Paris years earlier. The Paris Exposition had also unveiled Gustave Eiffel's incredible tower, so Burnham put a call out to American engineering: something grander would have to be proposed and built. National reputation was at stake as well as civic pride. Larson explores in exciting detail the glories and the tragedies of this great endeavor.In contrast to this paean to human ingenuity and spirit, Larson focuses the other half of his narrative on a man as diligent in his chosen task as Burnham was in his. H.H. Holmes, the self-style pharmacist, who killed upwards of twenty-seven (mostly young women, fresh to the city), built for himself a hideous parody of the grand buildings that the world would soon celebrate. Bit by bit, he crafted what would later be known as his murder castle, a hotel whose ground floor hosted several businesses and whose other floors would boast far more sinister use. The second and third floors contained numerous rooms and hallways and secret compartments and switches. Airtight rooms with gas outlets. Walk-in vaults purpose not for keeping out but for keeping in. And a slicked chute to the basement where a kiln, acid, and limepits awaited. Holmes was handsome and charming in a way that made him irresistible to women. He was also a psychopath who would turn the American attention far too late.Larson, as a chronicler, is top notch. He entertains even as he educates. And he leaves just enough narrative tension to compel the reader along his path. Larson knows how to keep enough information back to avoid rendering the latter half of his book naught but excruciating anti-climax. The Devil in the White City is certainly an accomplishment and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.If forced to, I will admit* two quibbles with the book: 1) I was thirsty for more pictures and wanted desperately to see these buildings that Burnham and company were so busied upon; and 2) on the whole Larson keeps his voice clean of any emotive spots not merited by the characters themselves, but there were two moments when I was sure I was hearing Larson's voice beam through (it could have been worse—at least those two moments were funny).*note: see what I did there? You didn't actually have to force me.!121![Edited, pictures added 1/5/21]A fascinating book and an easy read. Chapter by chapter, in simple chronological order, the author juxtaposes preparations for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair with the doings of one of the country’s first serial murderers. A movie is in the works. From the Fair chapters we learn how Chicago’s boosterism won it the fair from other competitors including Washington and New York. Construction was last-minute and in panic mode, but it got done. There’s a lot about Frederick Law Olmstead who was in charge of park design but he was elderly, in poor health, and struggling to stay on top of the project. A lot of the focus is on the lead architect and fair planner, Daniel Burnham, and construction of the “White City,” as the classical buildings came to be known. The serial killer was H. H. Holmes, a pharmacist who capitalized on the World’s Fair by building a hotel. It had special rooms in the basement to kill his victims and dispose of their bodies in a gas oven. Mostly his victims were young women but he was an equal opportunity killer, murdering some men and children as well – at least 20 victims but maybe many more. The author spares us most of the gory details. Once you get into it, it’s hard to believe this story is NON-fiction as the author insists on telling us, but all the events really are from diaries, letters, newspapers and police reports. Fascinating, with a lot of local color of the Windy City in that era.Eric Larson (b. 1954) specializes in writing fictional accounts of historical events. Two of his better-known books are Isaac's Storm about the hurricane that destroyed Galveston TX in 1900, and Dead Wake about the sinking of the Lusitania.

A leading Chicago architect Mr. Daniel Burnham and his partner John Root are chosen for the enormous job to build it, but also residing in the overcrowded fast growing, violent, dirty city Dr. Herman Webster Mudgett alias (one of many ) H.H.(Henry) Holmes, America's first well known serial killer. The two will never meet but their stories will make headlines around the globe. Mr. Burnham task seems impossible, made worse when his closest friend in business and in private life dies John Root, the committees don't and can't make decisions; days pass still nothing is being accomplished, at last the authority is granted him to be the boss, Burnham ("" Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood""). Slowly things begin to appear on a grand- scale the white, ( all the same color) huge, electrified buildings soaring into the sky, the scary, new Ferris Wheel will take you there if it is ever built, lagoons are made islands formed canals dug the waters come from sparkling Lake Michigan, boats follow, the ugly, empty Jackson Park begins to fill, something special even at this early stage is felt...Dr.Holmes likes pretty young women , just off farms and small towns, the feelings are mutual he pays attention to their every word, looks into their eyes, touches them gently the handsome, soft, well spoken con man has plenty of charm few are not enamored, wealthy too, owner of the strange rather gloomy, with mysterious odors the World's Fair Hotel nicknamed ""The Castle "", he keeps marrying the women a real lady killer...but will murder men too. This nonfiction book is very entertaining and always informative, you can imagine yourself back to the spectacular, enormously successful , thrilling, magical fair the numerous attractions in hundreds of buildings, from the very popular, exotic , belly dancers to the unsuitable Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show , he made a fortune just outside the exposition grounds , they don't make this kind anymore..!121!Larson could be the worst nonfiction writer working in America today. When he notes that ""[Frederick Law] Olmsted was no literary stylist. Sentences wandered through the report like morning glory through the pickets of a fence"" he might as well be describing himself. It's painful to make your way through his books. The melodrama is over the top. He'll go on for several pages about some unnamed person, attempting to heighten the ""mystery,"" and anyone who graduated second grade will quickly realize he's talking about the inventor of the Ferris Wheel. But only several chapters later - in the manner of Nancy Drew abruptly tumbling to the bottom of a dark well - he'll have the mystery man dramatically sign his name to a letter: George Washington Gale Ferris. George Washington Gale Ferris !!!!!!!! I did not see that coming.His narrative is peppered with the most insignificant, totally unrelated factoids, I suppose because they amused him and he couldn't stand the thought of leaving them out. He loves nothing more than to set a scene - so and so in a Pullman car or a fine dining club, this and that person on an ocean liner, attempting to send a cable to someone on the Titanic - merely in order to convey some piece of information totally unrelated to the wholly gratuitous scene. As to historical accuracy, doubtless there's a fair bit; he does have lots of end notes, and he consulted many historical sources. But he also embellishes novelistically in a way that no real historian would ever allow himself to do. It's shameful, and shameless. He asserts in the text that such and such happened, but if you check the endnotes, it didn't really happen - but it could have, he says. It was likely, he felt. After reading Isaac's Storm, which was also heavily embellished and the endnotes similarly acknowledging such, I don't trust anything this man writes. I wash my hands of him.!121!For me, reviewing this book is similar to trying to review any Nicolas Cage movie from the past 20 years, in that if I was asked if Cage's over-the-top performance was the best thing or the worst thing about the movie, I could only answer... ""Yes!""(Pictured - one of Nicolas Cage's more subdued performances; Not pictured - sanity)If you were to ask me my favorite thing about this book, I would immediately answer, ""Erik Larson's writing style!""This book is mostly talked about for the portions pertaining to one of America's first serial killers, Dr. H. H. Holmes. In fact, when the greenlit movie adaptation by Martin Scorsese was recently announced, it focused primarily on the casting of Holmes. Yet, more time is spent in the book detailing the history of the 1893 World's Fair, particularly architect Daniel Burnham's struggles in trying to get everything finished in time for the Fair's opening. I'm actually not much of a history buff, so I feared the ""true crimeless"" segments of the book wouldn't hold my interest, but I'm happy to announce that I was wrong. Larson's wit made even some of the dryer parts of the novel entertaining, and he even manages to build suspense when he's raising questions we may already know the answer to, like what engineering marvel would the Fair's organizer's decide on to hopefully rival the Eiffel Tower unveiled at France's world fair? As for the segments detailing Dr. H. H. Holmes and his grotesque crimes, this is where Larson's writing really shines. Instead of treating this strictly as a historical account (""and then this happened, and then this happened...), Larson actually writes these moments in the style of a thriller. He gets into Holmes head with the same prowess that Thomas Harris used to make Hannibal Lecter continue to chill our bones long after we had put the book down. There were times I almost forgot I was even reading a nonfiction book, as in these moments Larson's novel read more like something we'd expect to find in the horror section.Which is why if you were to ask me what my least-favorite thing about this book was, I would immediately answer, ""Erik Larson's writing style!""Bet you didn't see that coming, eh? That was a twist right out of an M. Night Shyamalan movie!(This clip is from ""Robot Chicken"" and led to ""What A Twist"" becoming a running joke on the show. If you already knew that, you are officially as cool as me. Whether you take that as a compliment or a reason to start sobbing is completely up to you!) While Larson's writing during the Holmes segments was undeniably gripping, I felt he went a little overboard with his speculative approach. He describes what was going through the victims' heads moments before Holmes murdered them, things Larson has no way of knowing were actually true. This did take me out of the book quite a few times, as when I'm reading nonfiction and the author keeps adding details that can't actually be confirmed, it make me begin to wonder how true this true crime novel really is!I did enjoy reading ""Devil in the White City"", although I would say it's more a book for history enthusiasts than true crime fans, as the 1893 World's Fair is clearly the novel's main event, while Dr. Holmes is more of a sideshow freak. Whether you're here for the Fair or the murder castle, Erik Larson's skills as a writer makes this an interesting read, as long as you don't mind getting some chocolate in your peanut butter speculative fiction in your true crime.(2-and-a-half-hours of fighting over chocolate in peanut butter... still a better movie than ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice""!)!121!REVIEW VANISHED! Noticed Feb 17, 2022. 🤬REPOSTED: Feb 28, 2022“Beneath the gore and smoke and loam, this book is about the evanescence of life, and why some men choose to fill their brief allotment of time engaging the impossible, others in the manufacture of sorrow. In the end it is a story of the ineluctable conflict between good and evil, daylight and darkness, the White City and the Black.” Erik LarsonParis welcomed the world to its “Exposition Universelle” in 1889. It opened its doors to the world’s fair and had as it’s showstopper the Eiffel Tower. It seemed that France declared to all who saw the tower that they had overtaken the United States as the glorious leader in metalworks. The gauntlet had been thrown and American pride was at stake. When it was determined that America would hold a world’s fair to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the “new world” by Columbus, Chicago won out over other major cities in contention for the right to host the event. The entire city worked as one to will the decision in its favor. From the moment in June 1889 that Chicago was granted the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, it had but a few scant months to organize location, financing, architects, engineers, tradespeople, exhibit collections, supplies, laborers, etc. and will the construction of a fair in all its magnanimity and splendor to be open on May 1,1893. Of course, it was understood that Chicago would have its own showstopper, but what it would be was yet to be invented! The World Columbian Exposition of 1893 was very significant in the development of many of the products/creations still in use today.  This organized chaos provided the backdrop for THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY: MURDER, MAGIC, AND MADNESS AT THE FAIR THAT CHANGED AMERICA. The story is the juxtaposition of good and evil: the Gilded Age vs the Panic of 1893; the “White City” of the fair vs the “Black City” of Chicago; and, Daniel Burnham, lead architect of the exposition project vs H H Holmes, prolific serial killer – both blue-eyed, handsome, and skillful in their chosen professions.H H Holmes was also an “architect” of sorts visualizing and having built a hotel meeting his unique specifications. His hotel would be for those travelers arriving to experience the fair; and, if a traveler happened to be a young woman, so much the better. “I was born with the devil in me,' [Holmes] wrote. 'I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.”Chicago’s world fair was a divining rod for the prolific ingenuity physically displayed by its white opulence and grandeur, hence “The White City, while “The Black City” was a reflection of the real struggle of the common man in Chicago displayed by destitution, violence, and wickedness surrounding the fair. For all the many good things that the Exposition had in its favor, time, the Chicago winters, economic depression, bank failures, and resulting unemployment were all betting against the Exposition’s success.The use of alternating the chapters between the main characters helped to drive the suspense and pulse of the story. It was riveting and definitely not boring. The amount of research put into this writing project is evident from the copious Notes at the end of the book. I definitely recommend this Erik Larson work of nonfiction and rate it 5 stars. Happy reading!!!121!Fantastic book! I have always been fascinated by the Colombian Exhibition, and weaving in the story of the fair, into a gripping serial killer case was fascinating!!121!in 1893, chicago took the world by storm when it hosted the world fair and created the marvel that was ‘the white city.’ and the man behind it all was architect, daniel burnham. not far down the street from the fair grounds, there was another man by the name of dr. henry holmes who took advantage of those visiting the city by luring women to his hotel and killing them. he is considered americas first serial killer. so what do these two men have in common? other than being in the same city at the same time, absolutely nothing. although this book will try to convince you otherwise. there honestly isnt anything connecting the two, so i am confused as to why there is so much focus on them both in this. i can understand a book about the history and creation of the chicago world fair, and i also get writing a book about the crimes of dr. holmes, but putting the two together did not make any sense to me. while reading about the building and design of the fair was interesting, its very dense compared to how holmes’ story is written. its almost like an information overload compared to the true crime chapters surrounding dr. holmes (which is what i was more interested in). it almost felt like the murders of dr. homes were just a fun little fact that was sprinkled throughout a history book about the 1893 world fair. so i think the synopsis and title are a little misleading with regard to the focus of this story.overall, this is quite an educational book. its not quite as entertaining as i thought it would be, but very informative nonetheless. the gilded age and importance of the world fair isnt something i knew much about, so it was neat to learn about it. although, i might try to find another book about dr. holmes, as this didnt quite satisfy my interest in him. ↠ 3.5 stars!121!Heard the one about the architect and the serial killer? It's not a bad joke, but it is a great book. The architect was Daniel Burnham, the driving force behind the Chicago World's Fair of 1893; the killer was H.H. Holmes, a Svengali-type figure who lured young women to his hotel and did the most gruesome things, the least shocking of which was murder. The two men never met, but The Devil in the White City brings their stories together, and although it reads like a novel, everything is thoroughly researched fact. The bookThe Great Columbian Exhibition of 1893 was Chicago's big chance to shake off its old image as a hog-slaughtering, dirty and dangerous town and to take its place as America's second city. Although the fair's theme gave a backward nod to the 400th anniversary of Columbus bumping into the Americas on his way to India, its vision was futuristic: for the first time, electric lighting, clean water, and planned green spaces could be experienced on a massive scale. Innovations - the Ferris Wheel, the hamburger, an elevated railway, Juicy Fruit gum, the zip fastener and shredded wheat among them - enhanced the feeling that the next century would belong to America. The buildings were monumental, the exhibits eclectic (one example: a map of the USA made entirely of pickles) and the visitors were awestruck. They called it the White City, from the colour of main buildings that were imposing by day, dazzling by night. Much of this was down to Daniel Burnham. His can-do reputation for building skyscrapers made him a natural choice as project manager. But we're frequently reminded that he had to push himself to the limit and step on quite few toes to ensure the Fair's success, a job made all the more difficult by economic recession, bickering architects, striking workers, pompous politicians and Chicago's notorious weather. As if all this weren't enough to occupy the reader, a parallel story takes us inside the grim world of H.H. Holmes. Capitalising on the advent of the Fair, Holmes built his own hotel to attract single young women who were streaming into the city from across America in search of work, independence and a new life in the big city. One such unfortunate believed she was on the threshold of marriage to this enchanting gentleman; in reality, she was destined for a gas chamber in the hotel basement. She was not to be the last to fall for his charms, but even in death there was no rest. Holmes literally picked over the bones of his victims, selling their remains to medical students eager to examine recently deceased corpses - no questions asked. At first, the benefit for Holmes was financial, but as time passed, the chase, the kill, the post mortem had become ends in themselves. A single-minded detective and a stroke of luck brought Holmes to justice, but even when he realised the game was up, he managed to keep his unsettling cool. My thoughts I had a strong feeling that I would take to this book, and from start to finish I was never disappointed. It fairly zings along, both stories proving absorbing, while casting out facts like frisbees. Although Burnham and Holmes are the book's dominant characters, there are walk-on parts for numerous figures who made their own mark on the White City. Buffalo Bill, Thomas Edison, and Scott Joplin are among the famous names, and the description of George Ferris's efforts to debut his eponymous wheel is a story in itself. But the lesser-known characters are also worthy of note. I pitied poor Frederick Olmsted's attempts to landscape the exhibition in the midst of an enormous, muddy construction site and a fit of depression. But I can see how ahead of his time he really was, insisting on natural greenery instead of a regimented collection of flower beds. Then there was Patrick Prendergast, whose descent into madness was to have a shocking impact on the Fair's final days; it's here that Larson's descriptive powers really come into their own. As for the serial killer, the author doesn't dwell on the sensationalist aspects of his more grisly activities, but what he leaves to the imagination is far more powerful. Extracts from letters written by a child kidnapped by Holmes are among the most upsetting words I've ever read - a reminder that the worst of human nature may not only be found in our own times. But my lasting impression from this book is one of optimism, of Burnham straining every nerve and sinew to achieve the impossible, and the ordinary folk of Chicago bursting with pride at what had been achieved. The U.S. edition of the book has the subtitle ""the fair that changed America"" - and that's certainly true, right down to the Pledge of Allegiance which can trace its origins to the exhibition's opening day. Beyond that, the Chicago Fair of 1893 not only showed America how it could be, but how it would be - better living and working conditions, convenience foods, domestic appliances, gadgets and more time for fun. In short, it heralded the prospect of a decent day's pay for a full day's work, a clean, safe environment, and of course the God-given right to eat shredded wheat. Who would like this book? I enjoyed it because of an interest in cities and architecture. But it would equally appeal to readers who are into engineering, politics, social history,horticulture, true crimes: does that leave anyone out?!121!I was genuinely excited to get back into this story every time I picked it up. At times, this jumble of factual events felt like a tale I would contrive while wandering aimlessly around Wikipedia (even though Erik Larson says he did not get information from the internet because, apparently all, data found on the internet is questionable). Most of the dramatic facts this book will tell you show up near the top of the internet, and many are proclaimed at a bars when someone lets everyone know where Pabst won their blue ribbon and follows with, “A young man by the name of George Farris went to that same fair in Chicago, 1893 — and he built himself a wheel.”The best story and the reason why I wanted more was the story of Holmes, who murdered dozens while becoming America’s first serial killer. I didn’t really care for the ten plus pages describing where the fair would go and then what park in said city it would be in. Some of these details were distracting and took too long. As the reader, I just wanted to get to the gruesome parts. People like to say that non-fiction, “reads like fiction,” when they think it is good but that doesn’t make much sense to me. Books without dialogue generally feel to me like Wikipedia, and they're good when I am able to stay interested.!121!Even though I had reviewed this book on 11-21-2021, Goodreads was showing it as ""Want To Read"" on 12-10-2021. When I went to change it, my entire review, along with all of the lovely comments I had gotten, disappeared. Now I am reposting it. Erik Larson has taken on the role of an infomercial guy, in his 2003 book The Devil in the White City. Do you want to know the history of the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893? That’s great, BUT WAIT, there’s more! Do you like reading about true crime and one of the first known serial killers in the U.S? That is even better, BUT WAIT, there’s more! I’ll throw in a side story about the nut case who murdered the mayor of Chicago.I found the history of the World’s Fair to be the most interesting part of the book and felt it should have been a stand-alone story. Larson captures the zeitgeist of Chicago in the 1890s. The grand buildings were all painted white, giving the grounds the name of “The White City.” The fair development and building were bogged down with bureaucracy, bad weather, union strikes, worker injuries, a short time frame to complete, and some poor structural designs. The people involved included the famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and Walt Disney’s father. Under the guidance of architect Daniel Burnham, the fair ended without losing money during a terrible economic time. The names that are dropped during the story were a who’s who of the American elite. Visitors included Nikola Tesla, President Benjamin Harrison, and Frank Lloyd White. Buffalo Bill set up his famous Wild West Show starring Annie Oakley just outside the fairgrounds. The 1893 World’s Fair introduced us to the Ferris Wheel, the tallest skyscrapers, grounds lighted by incandescent bulbs, and shredded wheat.The story involving “The Devil”, H. H. Holmes was mostly interesting as Larson details the criminal activities of a charming serial killer who killed numerous people at the time of the fair. The smaller story regarding the crazy Pendergrast seemed unnecessary to the book. The intermixing of the true-crime tales with the history of the fair was a bit odd but mostly worked.3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 because of Larson’s excellent story-telling ability.!121!Extremely well written and researched, unsettling, entertaining, educational and fascinating are all words that come to mind on finishing Eric Larson's book The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed AmericaThe Chicago World's Fair of 1893 was a remarkable achievement for the city of Chicago and it's architect Daniel H. Burnham and while the city was celebrating and enjoying this new wonder of the world, another man by the name of H.H. Holmes, a handsome and charming doctor was luring victims to their deaths and becoming America's first Serial Killer. This is the incredible true account of two very different men and the different paths their lives would lead them.This is my second Book by Eric Larson having read and loved Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania previously I was looking forward to another book by this author. His books are extremely well researched and very detailed and he leaves no stone unturned when telling a story. I loved learning about the Fair and the magnificent buildings, The World's first Ferris Wheel, Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show, electric boats, all the different elements that went into planning and organising such an amazing event. I loved how this book crossed over with numerous other books I had read about this time, (especially the quote from the notorious Chicago May who was born in Ireland only a few miles from my home and ended up becoming one of Chicago's most notorious Crooks of that time) I enjoyed the descriptions of families travelling long distances to the fair from small farms and towns and their amazement at witnessing these spectacular attractions and miracle of electricity for the first time. Eric Larson's descriptions are vivid and captivating and you actually imagine you are there at the centre of the city's excitement. Of course then you are brought back to reality with the murder and mayhem created by H.H Holmes and wonder how a man like this could have murdered so many innocent people and nobody noticed or suspected him.A word of warning  The Devil is in the detail and Eric Larson book's are high on detail and facts which I loved but some may find a tad tedious as the story does drag slightly in places but the historical information and descriptions are excellent and I loved every minute spent with this book.I listened to this one on audio and the narration was excellent.!121!This is really a great read filled with meticulously researched historical facts and notable people of the time. Even Helen Keller made an appearance at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair! Alternating chapters educate the reader about the enormous undertaking and time constraints of building ""The White City"" combined with the daily bloodthirsty activities of serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett aka Dr. H. H. Holmes.Reading about B. H. Burnham's construction of the fair during a time of deadly diseases, grotesque environmental conditions and bank failures was certainly enlightening, but most intriguing for me was erection of the monstrous ""Ferris"" Wheel with enclosed glassed-in seats. (googled some amazing photos)And this dude Dr. HHH.....Picture a young, handsome prosperous man with mesmerizing big blue eyes who is in fact an evil psychopath, sniveling cheat and conniving polygamist. This devil incarnate killed on a whim and caused turmoil in so many families with his slithering knack of preying on the weak and vulnerable; and while I wasn't too surprised at the naivety of the young women, the men falling for his sleazy schemes really shocked me.This work of non-fiction is jam-packed with interesting facts, faces and descriptive details that are too numerous to even begin to mention here, but now, whenever I see Cracker Jack, I'll sure remember where it originated.!121!The Devil in The White City is a fascinating study of the genius of two men and how they applied that genius. At first I was worried that the book would be too gory but most of the details are left to the imagination.However, the Fair is what captivated me. How these men managed to build such beauty and excitement with limited time, funds and a less than favorable location, is amazing. I live in Milwaukee, about a hour and a half from Chicago and I know this area well, that brought it home to me a lot. The descriptive writing painted a picture of the dazzling buildings as well as the many famous visitors. The Ferris Wheel was such an engineering feat that it's hard to believe that it all worked, sustaining the incredible weight of the cars and the people. The writing is absolutely superb and I could not put this book down. Afterward I spent many hours on the internet searching for photographs from the fair and was amazed to view it, it was even more spectacular than I had imagined. Strangely the Chicago Museum has very little on the Fair and the development of the Ferris Wheel.There was so much to learn from this book about this time period when Chicago struggled to prove itself and it did! As described in the book I'm sure it was depressing to see the fair end and go back to a regular life, particularly during those economically distressed time. The killings and plotting of H. Holmes were a tremendous shock to the 1800's society. I shiver to think how callous we have now become to such crimes.I will highly recommend this book to everyone who loves great writing and particularly to lovers of historical fiction.!121!The White City is the Chicago Columbia Exposition, a world fair in which all the buildings were painted white; the time the late 1800s during the fair; the Devil is a serial killer. Yet this is a non-fiction book. Larson has written a very informative as well as entertaining story. The Columbian Exposition was a very big deal. Chicago had vied for the honor of presenting a world’s fair, and when they were selected the energy of the famed slaughterhouse city was put to the wheel. There are many personalities involved, not least Daniel Burnham, one of the top architects of his day and the coordinator of the entire project design. He brought in Frederick Law Olmstead and many other top architects. Chicago was determined to outdo the French, whose world fair in Paris had been a triumph, introducing, among other things, the Eiffel Tower, and mass use of alternating current. Larson describes the conflicting and outlandish personalities of the time, and makes us marvel that the thing ever actually got done. The Chicago Exposition introduced some significant items of its own, not least of which was a very progressive notion of city planning, for the enterprise required attention to a multitude of facets simultaneously in order to come to fruition. One of the structures built was then the largest building in the world. The fair introduced Mister Ferris’ first working wheel. The Disney family attended and the fair may have inspired Walt to a development of his own. Buffalo Bill made millions with his entertainment just outside the fair gates (The fair had not allowed him to be a part of the show inside). Weather was a formidable opponent to the construction, as was the state of the economy, namely plummeting. Counterbalancing the travails and triumphs of creating the fair, the Devil of the title was a young man named Holmes (no, not Sherlock). He had a very winning way with people, particularly creditors and attractive young women. He had some flaws however. Among them was a complete inability to empathize with anyone. He was an extreme example of what we refer to today as a psychopath. He set up shop in Chicago about that time, acquired some property and constructed on it a building of his own design. It was called The Castle, and one might be forgiven for imagining it with lightning bolts blasting stormy skies. For it was here that he murdered untold numbers of people, women, men, children. He designed the building to incorporate a space in which he could trap and gas people. He also allowed for his need to incinerate the bodies without releasing much aroma. His charm kept the suspicious at bay. Eventually, of course, he was found out and brought to justice, but not until he had slain somewhere between 50 and 200 people. Larson peppers the book with dozens of satisfying factoids, about the people he is describing and about the times. It was, despite some of the darker subject matter, a very engaging, informative, and yes, fun read.!121!I have been meaning to read this book since it was published and I finally got around to it 15 years later. The Devil in the White City combines two of my favorite subjects Serial Killers & Victorian America. I've read a lot of other reviews for this book and people seem to really hate the fact that this book isn't just about H.H.Holmes. A lot of the reviewers apparently never read the back of the book or they would have known that its a split biography. The Devil in the White City is obviously about H. H.Holmes but its also about the 1893 Worlds Fair which was held in Chicago. For me The Worlds Fair was the most fascinating part. Maybe that's because I went in knowing about Dr. Holmes but the fair was completely new to me. I had to fight the urge to Google people and places while I read because I really wanted more information. Here are a few things the 1893 Worlds Fair introduced:The Ferris Wheel, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, Aunt Jemima boxed pancakes, and juicy fruit gum. For me this book lived up to the hype. Erik Larson paints a vivid and engrossing picture of the rise of Chicago and the first known American Serial Killer. If you enjoy books about True Crime or if you just enjoy a good History book then I highly recommend this book.!121!Utterly compelling.!121!Pre-review:

“His weakness was his belief that evil had boundaries.” 

Plus, meanwhile in London, Jack the Ripper!Still, I have to admit the parts of the book about the infamous H. H. Holmes is a bit flat compared with what had been written for Daniel Burnham and his merry band of architects, Holmes's tale reads like a dry true crime story. Don't get me wrong, Holmes' many deeds and his gruesome Murder Castle are still highly intriguing to read about, still I want more from his story even after I was finished with it.Documentary for H.

I enjoyed this book quite a bit. This was history made accessible but almost too accessible and readable to the detriment of depth and perhaps some additional analysis.This is a book that ties together (rather loosely) the development and execution of the Chicago World Fair in the 1890s and a sociopathic doctor serial-killer. The stories were not treated equally and at times the emphasis on the design and development of the architecture of the fair overshadowed the story of the doctor who was at times presented as an after-thought.To Mr. Larson's credit he took a wealth of information and presented it in an easily understandable style that read like a very long and pretty good Vanity Fair article. I, however, as a reader was not wholly satisfied and the two stories were not treated equally and sometimes the connections seemed rather loose and haphazard.All in all, though, I enjoyed this book and will read further books by Mr. Larson.!121!Ohhhh, this book is creeeeeepy and all-true!!! Being from Chicago I was in an awful thrall the entire time. The only thing that was missing for me would have been some kind of map to show where exactly the Fair was located, and all the other buildings he talks about... I think the fair was probably located roughly on what the Museum Campus is now, but I still would like to see a map. And the people! Burnham and Root and Atwood... and Carter Henry Harrison! It says his mansion was on Ashland, I'm wondering exactly where. And Mudgett... I wonder where all of his buildings were... it sends chills up my spine just to think about it. I wonder if anyone has put together a tourist's map based on this book? O.K., beyond my personal reasons for being fascinated, the writing is excellent, and really well documented. And the charming thing is that he documented everything in the back of the book in a really simple way, so if you were so inclined you would not have to be a big fancy scholar to follow his paper trail and see all of this stuff for yourself. Power to the people!And the writing style is accessible and the voice is also very appropriate... he kind of veers between eulogist and undertaker. And the few times that he takes liberties and describes things that no one could ever really possibly have documented, he does so in a way that is careful and responsible. And I think for him not to have taken the liberties would have been a mistake... I think everyone who read the book would have thought there was something missing. And what's ultimately really rewarding about this book is that the author outlines all the ways in which the influences of Fair of 1893 reverberated in American culture (and the world) for years afterward. Our aesthetic sensibility as a nation was permanently changed. And our technological sensibility. And to think that all of this was planned so fast, it was like a supernova in the middle of this underdeveloped backwater (oh, I said it. I live here now, and sometimes I still think of Chicago that way.). And that with all that progress comes this darkness, too, there's this underside to everything. And with that lovely thought, I'm going to try and find the Wooded Island. Ciao!!121!This was my first time reading a book by author Erik Larson, so I didn't know what to expect.He told two stories. One was a historical narrative from the perspective of Daniel H. Burnham who was the Director of Works and had the daunting challenge of constructing the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in a little over two years time. The other story was a true crime narrative about Herman W. Mudgett who was better known by one of his many aliases, H. H. Holmes. Holmes was an unknown psychopathic serial killer who owned a pharmacy and hotel near the fair site.Larson's superb writing skills intertwined these two stories to create a masterful portrayal of the events in that time. My only disappointment was the lack of pictures that would have even better enhanced my reading pleasure.!121!The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America by Erik Larson is a 2003 publication. Astounding! I recently read a review of this book online, which reminded me that I had a copy of it on my bookshelf. I was sure I had already read this book- albeit a long time ago- but I had not added it to any of my online book sites, which prompted an internal debate with myself – did I- or did I not read this book or did I maybe have it confused with another book I'd read about H.H. Holmes? As it turns out, I had read it- but it was so long ago many of the details had faded from my memory. Since I had not added the book to any of my online book sites, and I wanted to get a review up for it, I decided a refresher was in order.  To be clear, this is a true crime book about H. H. Holmes, but it's much more that- it's also about a time, a place, a huge event in history, and those who brought it all together. It's a horrifying story, but also a fascinating one. Larson is quite something, isn’t he? The research is, of course, phenomenal, but it’s the way he makes history come to life that kept me turning those pages. The book reads like a novel, which, as we know, is an approach many True Crime authors have mastered, but is a bit harder to pull off when writing about history. Anyone who feels history or nonfiction is too dry should give this book a try! Larson had me in the palm of his hand and despite my penchant for True Crime, it was the planning and execution of the magnificent World Fair that takes center stage. The architecture, all the vivid details, the people behind the scenes, and the influx of people into the city was just incredible. But evil was lurking in the background and the fair turned out to be the perfect environment for a serial killer- H. H. Holmes- to be exact. Holmes was most assuredly the stuff nightmares are made of!! He got away with so much, for such a long time, it was hard to take it all in!! Times were so different back then too- which made it easier for Holmes to con a more trusting public. Overall, Larson has a unique approach, and a well organized presentation, bringing together two seemingly different subjects, and linking them together in such a way that one can hardly tear themselves away from the pages. That’s a rare talent for historical writing. I highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys true crime and history, of course, but even if you usually prefer fiction, you’ll probably still find this book of great interest!! 4.5 stars!121!Always one to enjoy a little true crime, I had this book highly recommended to me by a very close friend. Erik Larson explores not only the electric sentiment surrounding the World’s Fair in Chicago, but also a sinister character hiding in the shadows, piling up a number of bodies while no one took much notice. The year is 1890 and Chicago is vying to win the right to host the World’s Fair. Set to take place in 1893, the fair has been promised to the United States, allowing a proper quadricentennial celebration of Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the New World. After a gruelling vote by Congress, Chicago won the bid and preparations began. Headed by Daniel H. Burnham, the ‘World’s Columbian Exposition’ started its planning stages, seeking the best land, the greatest buildings, and the most elaborate set-up possible to impress the world. With a limited timetable, everything had to move at lightning speed, something that Burnham would soon realise turned out to be a snail’s pace. In the background, one Herman W. Mudgett, who goes by H. H. Holmes, arrived in the area and settled in Chicago. Professing a medical background, Holmes sought to invest in local businesses and lay down some roots. His innovative ideas caught the attention of many, which was paired with his magnetic personality. However, deep within him lurked a man who was infused with the devil’s own magic, or so he believed. Larson discusses early in the book about how Holmes laid the groundwork for numerous cases of insurance fraud, having people obtain life insurance policies and name him (sometimes using more pseudonyms) as the sole beneficiary. Holmes was also known to use his eyes of the deepest blue to lock onto a woman and decide how he might have her as his own. Larson offers up a wonderful narrative as to how Holmes subtlety lured a certain young woman away from her husband, all while having the man invest deeper into a business venture. Once the woman had left her husband, he courted her and promised all the riches he could offer. He let nothing stand in his way, even a pregnancy that he sought to abort, removing all hurdles to his plans. Holmes brought the woman to his suite on Christmas Eve and killed her, though never allowed a single drop of blood to flow from her, thereby hiding much of the forensic evidence. A killer was born, at least in Chicago, though through some fast talking, Holmes convinced everyone that the victim had left to visit family, while selling her body to a local medical school once it had been disarticulated.With the fair set to open before too long, Burnham had yet to find his piece de resistance; something that would rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris from the fair not five years before. After a number of options proved too underwhelming and M. Eiffel’s attempt to create something new seemed to be a slap in the face, Burnham accepted an idea by a Mr. Ferris to create a massive wheel that would allow fair-goers to see the grounds and much of Chicago from a contained pod. With all the other preparations, Burnham left Ferris to create his masterpiece, hoping that it would be ready for the May 1,1893 opening. He set about making sure everything was running smoothly, while also being feted in the most extravagant ways (Larson includes the menus, which had my mouth watering). By the time the World’s Columbian Exposition opened, the Ferris Wheel was well behind schedule and fair-goers could only gawk at it, hoping that it might be up and running before too long. Burnham seethed in the background, as gate admissions proved to be troubling and the bankers were ready to call in their debts. Meanwhile, Holmes found a new woman to woo, choosing to present himself with a pseudonym so that no one would get suspicious. His plans grew as he had her help him prepare his hotel for the fair-goers, but would wait for things to really kick off before disappearing with more bodies attributable to his sinister work. Holmes surely had a taste for death, though his was far less gruesome than Jack the Ripper, the latest serial killer whose name had been splashed all across the tabloids only a few years before.In the culminating section of the book, Erik Larson offers the reader a glimpse not only into the wonders that the fair brought, but the intensity of Holmes and his killing spree. While the world was introduced to Juicy Fruit chewing gum, they were oblivious to the missing women who fell at the hands of a folded cloth of chloroform. Aunt Jemima instant pancake mix might have wooed households (more so than the new cereal, Shredded Wheat), Cracker Jacks offered up a new and sweet popcorn-based snack, and new technologies for communication and inter-personal socialisation. All the while, H. H. Holmes plotted horrible ways by which he could kill and feed his ever-growing need for power. In an interesting parallel, while the end of the exposition came, Holmes was also seeking to pack up and depart Chicago. Larson discusses some of the macabre events that saw the end of the exposition look blacker than Chicago had hoped. Holmes’ departure brought him to the attention of the authorities and a massive insurance fraud opened the door to some questions about the whereabouts of some who had gone missing. Larson shows how quickly things went from calm to chaotic and what led authorities to capture a serial killer no one even knew existed. A piece that will surely stay with me for years to come, as I make sure to find more books by Erik Larson to feed my appetite for this sort of writing. Recommended to those who love a chilling piece of true crime, as well as the reader whose love of history and late 19th century America remains high.Erik Larson offers readers a sensational piece of true crime, though it is so much more. His subtle telling of the murders committed by H. H. Holmes proves to add to the eerie nature of the entire experience, as he layers the narrative with the development and launching of the World’s Columbian Exposition. Featuring so much detail in the slow and methodical planning of the event, Larson pulls the reader into the middle of it all, as though they were there with Daniel H. Burnham through trial and tribulation. Equally as stunning is the means by which Larson told of the plotting Holmes undertook for each of his victims, making sure to fit himself into the community and win over the hearts of neighbours before causing the odd (and intricate) disappearance. Larson could not have added more detail, as it truly feels to the reader as though they are right there, down to the ‘large ice fangs that covered the trains one January night as the engines travelled along the tracks’. It is this depiction that turns this from a book of true crime to one in which the reader can almost sense what is lurking in the shadows. Some may wish to bolt their doors, others might not want to go out after dark, and still others may be left wondering about their neighbours and acquaintances, such is the depth to which Larson makes the reader feel a part of the action. The book is broken into four parts, with vignettes that serve as chapters. Larson balances the narrative between the exposition and Holmes’ activities advancing both as the timeline requires. This is surely one of those books that will keep the reader wondering what to expect, especially those who are not familiar with the murders. With so much to see and do throughout the book, the reader is sure to get lost amongst all the action and the numerous characters. Erik Larson does his best to keep it straight and provides the reader with the ride of their life... and I am not even referring to the Ferris Wheel.Kudos, Mr. Larson, for a sensational depiction of a period of time meant to be celebratory, with a definite pall of darkness clouding over it. I will be checking out more of your work to see what else I might learn. Love/hate the review?

As Chicago entered the final decade of the 19th century, it was a black city with a black heart, a figurative and literal pig sty run by a civil administration rife with graft and dominated by the stink of the pig slaughtering industry that was run by the local equivalent of capitalist robber barons. In a shocking affront to New York City's insufferable sense of superiority, Chicago's city fathers somehow won the right to host the 1893 World Fair. Despite the astonishing crime rates, the filth, the brothels, the sewage, the dirt, the overwhelming stench of the local pork packing factories and the noise and smoke of railways right in the center of the city, they were determined to prove to themselves, to a spiteful and jealous New York, to the USA and, indeed, to the world that they were a modern city, that they could put together an exposition of architectural beauty and technological marvels that could best the recent bravura performance in Paris that showcased the astonishing Eiffel Tower.THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is, in fact, two stories. The first is the story of the Herculean efforts and undoubted success of architect, Daniel H Burnham, in designing and creating the 1893 Columbian Exposition, a World's Fair that did indeed meet and exceed every expectation and lofty dream that even the most hopeful of Chicago's citizens might have envisioned. Unlike so many authors of non-fiction material, Erik Larson has put together a story that reads like a novel. We learn that the 1893 World's Fair hosted the unveiling of such myriad US innovations as Cracker Jacks, the Ferris wheel and shredded wheat. The engineers and architects responsible for building the fair were also instrumental in leading the USA to the choice of an electrical system based on AC current. We witness dignitaries and leaders from around the world have their breath taken away as they attend a fair that indeed showcases the US entry into the technology of the 20th century. Appearances from the likes of Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley make Larson's exciting story even more colourful.The second story is one of black, sinister evil that, at least in a metaphorical sense, contrasts with the uniform blinding white exterior of the magnificent structures that graced the grounds of the fair. Dr H.H. Holmes, born Herman Webster Mudgett, arguably the first documented American serial killer, opened a hotel very close to the fair. ""Hotel"" is a very charitable description of the building. In fact, it was a killing ground, a house of horrors equipped with a crematorium, gas chambers, surgical dissection tables, air tight vaults to torture and suffocate his victims. While the official count says that the charismatic and multiply bigamous Holmes was responsible for 27 murders, some estimates run as high as 200. From the point of view of creating an amazing story, Larson's decision to juxtapose two such different topics was brilliant - black and white, the magic and beauty of the fair contrasted with the evil and horror of a killer, light versus dark and hope versus despair. The story of Holmes' astonishing ability to get away with so much for so long is even an interesting contrast against the ultimate dogged pursuit of the evidence that would ultimately convict him.One of the editorial reviews of this books says:""Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that The Devil in the White City is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel.""Indeed, I read another review which made it quite clear that the author of the review had indeed suffered from this misunderstanding. The point is, of course, that Erik Larson has done his work that well. Interesting, informative and exciting, THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss!121!Erik Larson is an amazing historical writer -- one of those rare breed who can bring the past to life and make it seem immediate, fresh, intimate and amazing. The book is based on fact, but it reads like the best of novels, going back and forth between the team racing to put together the most important peacetime event in U.S. history, and a psychopathic murderer who is stalking the city at the same time, preying on young women with a cold efficiency that makes Jack the Ripper look like (excuse the pun) a hack. I had no particular interest in the Chicago World's Fair, but Larson is a teacher who can make you forget you are learning. Anywhere he chooses to take you, you can be assured the ride is worth the price of admission.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook']"

In 2023, my goal is to consume less and create more. The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn’t actually writing anything. When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn’t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn’t feel any better than earlier in the day. Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled, “Writing,” from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.Also, it talks about lofty goals.Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta!121!This book does a great job of laying down the framework of how habits are formed, and shares insightful strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I’m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin’s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There’s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not “breaking the chain”. So while the author isn’t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author’s intellectual rigour.Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under “Advanced Tactics” that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.The three star rating I am giving this book doesn’t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick.!121!TLDR; - ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""- The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity.- Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. ""Read 30 books"" ⇒ ""Read before bed every night"" ⇒ ""Read one page"". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step.- Stick to the plan: ""Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way."" Don't be a ""fair weather runner"" if you want to run a lot.- Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.Most modern ""American self-help books for engineers or entrepreneurs"" (it is a category for me) are too repetitive and too long. Atomic Habits is not! It does have the category-required set of stories of American (mostly men) who built a great habit and got to the top - but just the right amount. ----- NOTES -----*Identity*The three levels of change - the lower the more ""fundamental"":3. Outcomes = Your goals 2. Processes = Your system1. Identity = Who you perceive yourself to beMake every action is a vote for what kind of person you want to become. Building habits is becoming the version of yourself you want to be. Habits help you to trust yourself. - Realize that ""You don't _have to_ do anything, you _get to_."" - Ask ""What would a healthy person do?"". - Ask ""What feel like fun to you, but is work to others?""*Engineer it so that:*Things you want to achieve vs Things you want to avoidObvious —————————————— InvisibleAttractive ————————————UnattractiveEasy ————————————————— HardSatisfying ————————————- SatisfyingFor example: if you want to watch less TV - keep it unplugged - only plugin if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch.!121!“The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”

 What a doozy of a quote. I guess it pays to be a prideful guy. Well, it seems luck isn't on my side when it comes to personal development reads, and ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is no exception. Despite the hype surrounding it, I find myself once again let down by a tired, regurgitated pop psychology book that fails to deliver.The information presented feels like a rehash of what I've stumbled upon in the productivity blogosphere for the past decade. But it's not just the lack of freshness that bothers me—it's the execution. The writing feels robotic, the repetition grows tiresome, and the cherry-picked anecdotes conveniently support the author's points, often taken out of context. Even the scientific references feel shaky and questionable at times.While the core ideas explored in ""Atomic Habits"" aren't inherently bad, they've already been covered by other authors with more depth and skill. Writers like Kelly McGonigal and George Leonard come to mind, offering a richer exploration of the subject matter. Frankly, I can't help but feel that the material in this book could have easily been condensed into a blog post or article. Instead, what I encounter is a bloated book filled with unnecessary fluff, making it feel like an extended infomercial for the author's blog. It's evident that this is just another platform to boost his personal brand and generate 'passive income'.I guess the world really needed another privileged marketer with an A-type personality telling people they can become like him if they follow his 'secret formula.' It seems tailor-made for a specific group of individuals—those who aspire to be the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire, like Tim Ferris, and his devoted followers.P.S.I should note that despite my disappointment, I've come across individuals who found value in this book, claiming it transformed their lives. However, in most of those cases, they failed to sustain the new habits they initially adopted and years later it's like they never read the book. While ""Atomic Habits"" didn't meet my personal expectations, it may still hold potential for people who are new to the subject or resonate with the author's approach. And hey, if it floats your boat and makes you feel like the captain of your own destiny, who am I to rain on your parade? Happy reading!!121!The first great book about habits was the Power of Habit. That book was quite theoretical and difficult to apply. This book, Atomic Habits, has a completely different approach. James Clear focused on writing a book that goes deep into every single step of habit creation from a practical point of view. At the end of the day, who we are and what we will achieve depends so much on these small habits that we do every day. James Clear argues, that focusing only on improving those habits will lead to much bigger changes and accomplishments.My top 3 takeaways from this book are:* Forget about goals, focus on the system instead.* Change your identity to change your habits.* Motivation is overrated. Design the environment to support your habits.From this book, I distilled 21 strategies and principles on habit creation, and also I wrote a detailed book summary that you can read here: https://www.mentorist.app/books/atomi...!121!“Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.""Did not live up to the hype. There’s good material here, and easy-to-follow strategies to improve our habits, but I found it a chore to wade through. My interest ebbed and flowed and ironically, I felt it could be the book to undo my healthy reading habits and routine.Atomic Habits succeeded in bringing awareness to my daily habits and making me more 'present'. The likes of “habit stacking” and “habit tracking” are things that I have started implementing since reading this. But while it’s great to be self-aware and regularly analyse our behaviours, I found it tiresome after a while.“Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.”Tedious.James Clear gives many examples of famous people who achieved success via their approach to habits. I enjoyed reading some of those, but far too often, content felt like it was being regurgitated from other books and work in the field of habits and human psychology. Sometimes it felt like he had simply thrown catchy new titles on pre-existing ideas and methods. Other times, it just seemed like common sense.The book is not just about developing good habits and sticking to them, but about eliminating bad ones. I was pleased to see reference to Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking – a book that already made a huge difference to my life! The importance of patience, the difference between 'motion'/'action' and the two-minute rule (when starting a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do) were all takeaways that resonated with me.The chapter summaries were helpful to remember key points, but also made it clear there was substantial filler surrounding a couple of main ideas. These ideas are solid guidelines though, and no doubt helpful for building a better life - I guess time will tell.It's perhaps worth noting that my grievances with Atomic Habits are in the minority - many find this book amazing, so don't let my words prevent you reading this if you think it could be helpful. After all, I'm left wanting to eat healthier, improve my bedtime routines and embrace minimalism - so all this has to be good. “Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.”!121!Reading this book feels like reading a homework assignment. James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it doesn't, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.* Simplify science to the border of being wrong. * Abuse of ""as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____""* Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca. At least these are attributed and not refurbished. If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book.If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear. You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.Start with Why - Simon SinekMastery - George LeonardOutliers - Malcom GladwellThe Tipping Point - Malcom GladwellGetting Things Done - David AllenThe Element - Ken RobinsonBehave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field]Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]!121!I was prepared to dislike this book but I really enjoyed it!I've seen it on so many list of ""life-changing non fiction"" next to deeply misogynistic authors and it's popular with people promoting hustle culture so I didn't expect it to work for me.While I can't say that the information in it is that different from other books I've read on the topic, it's definitely the best breakdown of said info that I've seen.Super accessible, bitesize chapters... absolutely go with the audiobook if you enjoy them. I didn't want to sit while reading it because I was too busy reorganizing my space while listening to it!Worth it!121!Why do I keep doing this to myself? All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you're fabulously rich, but, if you're like me and don't currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.!121!The nuclear option for pimping, rebranding, fine-tuning, and perfecting grey cells. Atomic also in one regard: As long as it works, it´s perfect down to the smallest part, each atom. If it fails, it´s radioactive and self cannibalizing, -destructing- and demotivating. To exaggerate, we can develop great working, social. and creative habits or destroy ourselves with neuroticism going haywire, find great ways to optimate oneself or madness, just read anecdotal filled pop psychology/science/philosophy books one can read without the danger of the hard work of really changing something or choose the difficult way and this book.The 1st Law Make it obviousRepetition and consequence, as if it wasn´t so shamefully obvious, is one of the key elements to everything, a skill, foreign language, school, degrees,… and the funny thing is that successful people use learning, creativity, memo-, techniques to perfect their skills, but forget the motivational, critical thinking, analytic retrospection, optimization, meditation-,… techniques, and, most importantly, to recapitulate, criticize oneself, let others criticize oneself, reflect, and develop. There is always some space left toward top performance but without modifying or even changing habits, they won´t be possible and nothing is more painful than stopping a working, well known, perfected, but ineffective habit, using an oldfashioned program, modify a schedule, use knowledge and expertise in a new, complicated, unknown way, etc. The brain is a bit bitchy, nagging, and one´s worst enemy, because it´s a lazy manipulator, not wanting one to do something that means real work for it, trying to make it feel as uncomfortable as possible, wanting easy stagnation instead of sweaty evolution. The 2nd Law and 3rd Law Make it attractive and easyAs if this wasn´t already painful and difficult enough, the self experimental subject now has to implement unused, and thereby for the crying, sobbing, angry brain very painful, new neuronal integrated circuits because, as one knows, reptile stem brain and monkeys social anxiety wants one to run far away from everything new, different, possibly dangerous. Here the inner demons have to been disguised as angels to make the whole agony as attractive as possible, a kind of hopeful masochism. Detecting the deficits has already wasted vast resources of willpower and now one doesn´t even have the legitimation to kill and destroy positive change with anger and negative emotions, but the new mind baby has to be raised next to the rascals one has to be tolerant and sympathetic towards.The 4th Law Make it satisfyingReaching this point is tricky, as one needs the stamina, perseverance, and resilience not to resign. As the old behaviors often aren´t directly harmful, just unproductive and used, they will come whispering and trying to get a hold of the subconscious mind to develop back towards the beginning. Humans are creatures of habit and whenever one just loses track and motivation for a second, their siren calls will try to lure you into old behaviors whose reminiscences are still lurking behind each screen, interaction, or working process.And as if all of this wasn´t torture enough, it should come with personal development and vivisecting one´s personality, thoughts, memories, all these things that seemingly aren´t directly related to work, too. Because hidden in the chasms of each simulated reality lies the key to boosting the occupational performance even more by eliminating all the mental corpses of complexes, childhood traumas, anxieties, phobias,… As long they are not overcome, they keep holding one down, interrupting the workflow, reducing concentration, focus, the quality of sleep,… even changing the obvious problems won´t unleash the full potential.A tip, after I´ve read a few of the most highly recommended DIY self brainwashing mind penetrating behavioral modification endeavor books for dummies, I´ve come to the conclusion that most of the theory, techniques, and schedules can easily be found during a longer google search, a Wikipedia or special wiki and Reddit, Quora walk, just using the essential keywords, bookmarking a few dozens to hundreds of pages of interest, copying the subjectively most essential and useful elements and still begin with the 1st law. But it would at least have cost you nothing. It´s getting a bit anecdotally and subjective now, even personal (cause people seem to like that stuff for whatever reason) and, of course, misanthropic, so don´t be shy to stop reading here and saving time and eye power that could be focused on reading something profound. Seriously, I´ve warned you.One of my main advantages is that I am naturally neurotic, a bit of still under control and productive, not negative elements of perfectionism, some might say soft OCD, but who listens to people, pedantic; a bit antisocial, and cold, rational, things very helpful when implementing new behavioral patterns because one doesn´t care about whatever other people think.  I am a bit biased here, because I have the, depending on the standpoint, positive or negative tendency to overachieve and excessively focus on one thing for weeks and months up to 12 or 14 hours a day, obsessive might be an understatement, let´s call it possession instead. Afterward, it´s often difficult to say how the final results, ideas, solutions paths developed, but conditioning oneself to combine focus and flow to hard fun and gamification, optional collaborative learning, yuck, might be a good alternative to just partying hard. This leads me to the extroverts that might face massive deficits in this regard, as they have the unfortunate tendency to spent much unproductive time with other people, leading to excessive, exponentially growth of sympathy, friendship, contact, dangerous pheromones, endorphins, territorial alpha behavior,… manipulating logical thinking, in the worst case not just resulting in friendships, but love, relationships, and kids bringing the distraction in your home, permanently, reproducing and multiplying it and giving it names, all things that make one ineffective, cost time. So start avoiding people, feel cold, sad, and dead inside; and whenever you are doubting, compare what the introvert vs extrovert forever achieving score lists brings in comparison, all science and technical evolution that is human history vs all BS, war, extremism, tradition, all evil isms. Doesn´t an empty, lonely life seem a small price for helping primate progress? Don´t forget thanking me for ruining your socialization with these stupid tips, lol. But seriously, social life is another prime example of habit, one becomes the people she/ he is in regular contact with and attracts more of these people, a dynamic one should not underestimate, and they all feed on you lifetime by craving for your attention, just compare how much one can get from articles and books in comparison to real life drivel filled with small talk, redundancies, errors,..., heck even the better memorization and internalization of content by social contact can be achieved with sophisticated learning techniques. To continue the isolationist standpoint (joke), it´s of course meanwhile absolutely unnecessary to make anything face to face and not in home office, VR, AR, psi transfer remote perception,... the technological singularity in general makes it more and more useless to leave the home castle. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful...!121!This book just climbed to the top as my most favourite self-help non-fiction of the year!Totally engaging and quite convincing in how the book makes you want to change your bad habits and adopt good ones, this book doesn't talk in a way to make you feel overwhelmed or make you feel like everything you do is wrong or inadequate. The book doesn't give you impractical tips yet it tells stories and what to learn in how to gradually maintain habits that would benefit you in the long run as well as how to start maintaining habits that you have been wanting to in small practical steps. This book is life-changing for me.I have already adopted some of these tips yet the book makes me realise that there are many things that we do that we consider harmless yet taking up most of our time which make us frustrated in real. The tips are easy to understand and follow. The writing is amazing. I would highly recommend this book.This one is already changing my year and the rest of everything else that's going to happen in how I make my future a better and a fulfilling one.Too good to be true. Literally life changing 🍂!121!This is the only book on 'habits' you should read.It lays out all the rules of changing/developing habits in a simple, straightforward way and gets right to the point without a bunch of rambling and seemingly unrelated filler chapters like some other self development books i've read.!121!There are many self-help books discussing the topics of habit. Some of them are written by famous authors like Stephen R. Covey, Charles Duhigg, and Timothy Ferris. I read this book after reading the books by the above authors and was sure that I won't get any new information. Despite discussing a similar topic, James Clear managed to pull a convincing book discussing these familiar ideas in a new way that will help us view our daily routine and life differently and will be a good choice if you are interested in the topic of productivity. —————————————————————————

That's a big one. We're all lazy creatures at our core, but some of us are better at streamlining things we don't like to do to make them easier to accomplish.What are you talking about, Anne?Ok, so I noticed that my upstairs was a lot dirtier than my downstairs. If there was a pile of hair and fuzz on my bathroom floor, it would likely sit there until it became sentient. Why? Because my broom, mop, and cleaners were all downstairs. So, I went out and got the exact same stuff and set up a mini cleaning closet in my linen cabinet. And now that everything is within easy reach, my upstairs bathrooms look far less terrifying. Ta-da!I'm keeping things clean using the power of laziness!But the basic gist of what he talks about is really just not giving up. If you didn't go on a walk today, that doesn't mean that you are incapable of getting healthy. The plan is to just put on your shoes. If you can get up and put on your walking shoes, you're halfway there. Yes. Even if you just take your shoes right back off.The goal is to begin the habit with (pun intended) baby steps.As far as self-help books go, this one seems reasonable. There's no weird go-go-go mentality and you don't have to do anything differently, other than to make very small positive changes that will set you up for success. You don't measure your success daily, you look at how far you've come over the course of a year. And with the mindset that doing anything positive to work towards getting better will get more results than if you had done nothing at all.In other words:Some of his tricks and tips require a bit more structure (like getting someone to hold you accountable) but most of the things he tells you to do are pretty painless. And I've always found that sticking to simple, small, easy changes is the best way to get long-term results.Going on some crazy diet that cuts out all {insert food I love here}, never lasts past a year. But cutting down on processed sugar, eating more veg, and going on walks is a long-term doable way to achieve better overall health in the long run. Those types of habits don't necessarily get any sort of flashy results right away but you'll be more likely to keep the results that you do get.Recommended.!121!I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway yesterday and immediately settled down to read it. I am always very skeptical of self help books because they often do no get to the root of issues. This one did. James Clear's main arguments are that habits are the compound interest of self improvement and that your identify emerges out of your habits. So, you must expereince a shift in identity for your habits to hold. This made a lot of sense to me, but I do think that Clear should have addresses deeper emotional issues and gave readers resources so as not to mislead them into believing that they can change their identity by action (repeating new habits) alone.!121!Hope everyone can read this review until the end. 💕Pick up this book thanks to a Tik-Tok video of a guy who showed different books recommended for personal development. I really wanted to start this year changing habits, incorporating ‘the good new’ and eliminating the bad ones.From the first chapters I began to follow the steps and marveled with the achievements. I really recommend it to all who want to evolve and transform into any field of their lives. Or simply feel better with yourself.Based on this, I'll be less active on GR. Although from time to time I'll appear again here to see which readings you all enjoyed and read your great reviews.All my love to this community that shares so much kindness. My deepest gratitude for making me smiled so many times.--------------------------Espero que puedan leer esta reseña hasta el final. 💕Llego a este libro gracias a un video en Tik-Tok de un chico que mostraba diferentes libros recomendables para el desarrollo personal. Realmente quería arrancar este año cambiando hábitos, incorporando ‘nuevos buenos’ y eliminando los malos.Ya desde los primeros capítulos empecé a seguir los pasos y me maravillé con los logros.Realmente lo super recomiendo a todos quienes quieran evolucionar y transformarse en cualquier ámbito de sus vidas. O simplemente sentirse mejor con ustedes mismos. En base a esto, voy a estar menos activa en GR aunque de vez en cuando volveré a aparecer por aquí para ver cuáles lecturas disfrutaron y leer sus geniales reseñas.Todo mi amor a esta comunidad que tanta amabilidad comparte. Un profundo agradecimiento por haberme hecho sonreír tantas veces.!121!This book and Emotional Intelligence Habits by Travis Bradberry are my two favorite self-improvement books. Atomic Habits teaches you how small habits (many of which you aren't even aware of) compound over time to make a huge difference in your life. When you work to form good habits they accumulate and build upon each other and you see major changes with very small actions. The book has some suggested habits, but I wish there were many more (specific recommendations for good habits to adopt). That's why I love Emotional Intelligence Habits so much. Emotional Intelligence Habits has more than 700 different habits targeting everything from happiness, confidence, likeability, relationships, leadership, productivity, dealing with toxic people, you name it. It's an incredible book and these two go great together.!121!I am in the mood for more non fiction lately, so I decided to read the books of Ali's book club. I wanted to read a book on habits for a long time now and Atomic Habits met all those criteria.I am not gonna elaborate a lot since it is a well known book and there are a lot of YouTube videos that summed it up better than I can ever do including Abdaal's video here: Check VideoLike all non-fiction books, I found most of the information in the book to be logical but the way it was written and ordered was pretty good. I found it engaging, easy to read and scientific. I enjoy it when authors provide data through real life stories and there was a lot of that here.The book mostly discusses 4 laws to get into a habit or get out of one. These are: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying. And if you inverse those you get a way to lose bad habits. A very intriguing read!!121!يرتبط الكتاب بتجربة صاخبة ومن ثم صقلها لتكون له أسلوب حياة وعندما يعنونها بالذرية فهو يقصد المقدار التراكمي للذرة الصغيرة لتصبح كتلة , عندما يكون التوق لدينا في انجاز هدف معين ( انقاص وزن, تأليف كتاب , لياقة بدنية عالية ) يجب علينا حسب الكاتب أن تنشئ عادة متراكمة لهذا الفعل لأن الهدف قد يحقق ومن السهولة فقدانه متى ما أنهينا العادة ورجعنا لنفس الأسلوب , بمعنى قد تستطيع تحقيق هدفك بانزال وزنك في فترة وجيزة ولكن بمجرد عن تخليك عن هذه العادات الصحية فسرعان ما يعود الوزن الى عهده السابق يتطرق الكتاب الى استراتيجيات مقرونة بقصص وبراهين كتبت بأسلوب شيق ونقاط محددة وواضحة لتغيير اتجاهات وعادات خاطئة اعتدنا عليها ويشرح بطريقة مبسطة استراتيجيات مبسطة للاقلاع عنها وهو من أجمل كتب تطوير الذات التي مرت علي!121!“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”I’ve been trying so hard lately to break out of a funk and every self-help book I read recommends starting at the most basic level. We must sort out our daily habits before we can begin to feel better and more fulfilled in our lives. But how do we do this? Gradual change is the answer. If we improve each day by just 1% by the end of the year we will be dramatically and unrecognizably better. Winning tiny battles will determine our future self. Identifying bad habits that are ruining our potential is the key to change. We must eradicate them, slowly, if need be, and replace them with habits that allow us to grow each day. We must set goals and work towards them in a sensible and patient fashion.“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”We also need to design a system to achieve our goals. Simply having goals is not enough. We need to have an actionable framework on how we can move towards these otherwise we will never reach them. We must have a process to follow and daily habits that allow us to achieve them. Our level of commitment to the process will determine our level of progress. Sticking to healthy proactive habits with our end goals in mind is the key. So, here’s a little bit about me and my goals for this year: I want to complete a 100-mile ultra-marathon and I also want to have written up a full draft of my PhD. How will I achieve these goals? Habitually running and writing each day, habitually working towards them and remaining committed to the process of daily improvement. I will also read everyday and review on Goodreads more frequently because it helps me remain focused on the process. Daily writing is so important for me as is learning and discovering more literature. I quite enjoyed this. It proposes a very straightforward approach to being successful and one I am very keen to implement into my own life. So let’s do this 2023! ___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________!121!یکی از بهترین کتاب‌های خودیاری که خوندم!واقعیت اینه که خودم رو لابه‌لای قانون‌های کتاب پیدا می‌کردم و می‌گفتم چه جالب منم دقیقا همین کارا رو انجام می‌دم! از این به بعد اگر کسی ازم بپرسه چطوریه که تو این‌قدر به همه‌ی کارات می‌رسی و پشتکار داری، به جای نمی‌دونم، می‌تونم این کتابو معرفی کنم.کتاب در مورد اینه که چطوری با قوانینی ساده، زندگیمونو بهتر کنیم و روزهامونو بهینه‌تر بسازیم تا بتونیم به کارهایی که دوست داریم انجام بدیم برسیم و جزء جدایی‌ناپذیر روزهامون بشن.--------------------یادگاری از کتاب:کیفیت زندگی ما غالبا به کیفیت عادت‌هایمان بستگی دارد....عادت‌ها غالبا هیچ تفاوتی ایجاد نمی‌کنند، تا اینکه از یک مرزی عبور کنیم و سطح جدیدی از عملکرد گشوده شود....تمام نتایج بزرگ از شروع‌های کوچک حاصل می‌شوند....هر قدر یک رفتار را بیشتر تکرار کنید، بیشتر هویت مربوط به آن رفتار را تقویت می‌کنید‌...موثرترین راه برای تغییر عادت‌ها، این است که نه بر روی دستاوردهای مدنظرتان، بلکه روی شخصیتی که دوست دارید تمرکز کنید....چگونه یک عادت خوب بسازیم: اولین قانون (سرنخ): آن را شفاف و آشکار کنید. دومین قانون (تمایل): آن را جذاب کنید. سومین قانون (پاسخ): آن را ساده کنید. چهارمین قانون (پاداش): آن را رضایت‌بخش کنید....﻿_چگونه یک عادت بد را از بین ببریم: اولین قانون (سرنخ): آن را مخفی (پنهان) کنید. دومین قانون (تمایل): آن را لوس و غیرجذاب کنید. سومین قانون (پاسخ): آن را دشوار کنید. چهارمین قانون (پاداش): آن را عامل نارضایتی کنید....عادت‌های شما راهکارهای مدرن برای تمایلات دیرین هستند....هر قدر یک عادت به انرژی کمتری نیاز داشته باشد، احتمال وقوع آن بیشتر است....بهترین راه این است که همواره در اوج و زمانی که عملکردتان خوب است، متوقف شوید....مغز انسان چالش را دوست دارد، اما چالشی که میزان دشواری آن در یک حد بهینه و معقول باشد....﻿بالاترین تهدید برای موفقیت، نه شکست بلکه بی‌حوصلگی است. از عادت‌هایمان خسته می‌شویم، زیرا دیگر ما را مجذوب نمی‌کنند.!121!DNF at 45% I don't even want to waste any more time on this book with a full review. Here's a quick rundown of why I hated it:Ableism throughoutBootstrap mentality Fatphobia throughoutCondescending, patronizing tone from the author (even, or maybe especially, on the audio version.) I could go on...This book had some valid, common sense points, but its flaws far overshadowed any redeeming qualities. Just...nope.!121!""Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.""  Goals are useful for charting a course, but systems are the most effective in moving forward. When you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time creating your systems, you'll run into a few issues. The antidote is a systems-first mentality. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to permit yourself to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.My 3 major takeaways from this  book are:1. An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is small and easy to do and is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.2. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.3. Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.Highly recommended to understand the science behind habit building and practically implement those baby steps to build or break a habit.Grab your copy here or here.!121!The book was overwhelmingly male-centric. Most of the examples he put forward (other than ballet dancer Twyla Tharp and doctor Anne Thorndike), were about male stockbrokers, scientists, businessmen, sports figures (Michael Phelps, Magic Johnson) and comedians (Steve Martin, Chris Rock). Where are the successful women? Also, it was more about using habits to be ""successful"" in a traditional sense, by making your way to the top of the corporate ladder or excelling in whatever you do, being fit or elite or whatever, instead of improving relationships, decision making, work/life balance, or overall, just being a good person. Funny, I was highlighting a bunch of material (a signal that I was full of hope!) in the first chapter, then it abruptly stopped, and I never highlighted another item in the whole book. The last thing I noted was on page 33, where some guy/entrepreneur says, ""I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure. My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn't chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time.... Suddenly, I was so proud of my fingernails."" Here, I wrote, ""WTF?"" Sorry, but a statement like this reeks of privilege and frankly, makes me want to puke. I am concerned about his wife, and I can't believe it got past the editors. Was this written in 2018 or 1988? In retrospect, this was the moment I should have abandoned the book and opted for something more relevant to my life. Another problem I have with this book.... he talks much, in the beginning of the book, about identity change. ""The goal isn't to read the book, it's to become a reader."" Or ""The goal is not to run a marathon, it's to become a runner...""  Then in the last chapter, in his ""downsides to habit change"" he discusses how identity can hold you back. The key is to ""keep your identity small,"" (some investor guy says) because your identity will change as your role changes (or with age). So, ""I'm an athlete"" becomes ""I'm a person who is mentally tough and loves a challenge."" ""I'm a soldier"" becomes ""I'm the type of person who is disciplined, reliable and great on a team."" ""I'm the CEO"" translates to ""I'm the type of person who builds and creates things."" So, the message is to have a flexible identity. I actually think this is key information that provides a healthy balance in life, and belongs right up there in chapter 1 with all the other information about identity. Rather, it's an afterthought at the very end of the book. And it's contradictory. Also, where is the ""I'm a good listener. I'm there for my kids. I make time to help others. I'm a good friend."" Are all habits so.... macho and self-centered? Maybe I missed the point, or maybe it was just the wrong book for me. That said, I did pull some good information from chapter 13, the two-minute rule/habit shaping. When I opened it to this chapter in the book store where I bought it, I was intrigued. I thought this type of information could help me with my 2021 goals (which have been blown to bits). But I found it the most helpful chapter in the book, overall. I can use the ""art of showing up"" and the concept of not being consumed by the end goal in my life. I learned: If you're a woman and you're looking for a book on habit change, pick up a book written by a woman; preferably one who has done her research and with whom you have something in common.!121!Well, there’s almost no single shred of original content here. It could be a fine book if it’s the first self-improvement book you have started to read. The science is also flawed. He presents the following elements for habit:1. Cue2. Craving3. Action4. Reward Not to mention that its a skewed copy of principles presented in Power of Habits (to authors credit, he mentions it), craving starts to appear strongly only when your brain has learned to associate the cue, action, reward which happens with repetition. Two star is a good score. It was merely okay. Given the earth-shattering noise it had made, I simply expected more.!121!Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones, James ClearIf you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «عادت‏‌های اتمی؛ تغییرات کوچک و نتایج چشمگیر راهی آسان و اثبات‏‌شده برای ایجاد عادت‏‌های خوب و ترک عادت‏‌های بد»؛ «تغییرات جزئی، نتایج چشمگیر»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی‮‬‏‫: یک راه ساده و اثبات‌شده برای ایجاد عادات خوب و شکستن عادات بد، تغییرات کوچک، نتایج قابل توجه»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی»؛ «راه آسان و اثبات شده برای ایجاد عادت‌های خوب و شکستن عادت‌های بد، تغییرات کوچک، نتایج قابل توجه»؛ «جورنال خرده‌ عادت‌ها»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی: خرده عادت‌ها»؛ «عادتهای اتمی: تغییرات کوچک، نتایج چشمگیر»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی: راهی آسان و اثبات شده برای ایجاد عادت‌های خوب و ترک عادت‌های بد»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی: عادت‌های کوچک شخصیت شمارا شکل می‌دهند راهکارهای موثر برای جذب عادت خوب و ترک عادت‌های بد»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی : تغییرات کوچک، نتایج چشمگیر روشی آسان و اثبات‌شده برای ساختن عادت‌های خوب و شکستن عادت‌های بد»؛ و ...؛ نویسنده: جیمز کلییر؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و ششم ماه اکتبر سال 2018میلادیعنوان: عادت‏‌های اتمی؛ تغییرات کوچک و نتایج چشمگیر راهی آسان و اثبات‏‌شده برای ایجاد عادت‏‌های خوب و ترک عادت‏‌های بد؛ نویسنده: جیمز کلیر؛ مترجم هوشمند دهقا��؛ تهران، هورمزد، سال1397؛ در320ص؛ شابک9786226010221؛ موضوع: ترک عادت از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا -

Todo el mundo debería leerlo.Este es otro gran amigo de papel que me encuentro en el camino; amigo que me otorga multitud de enseñanzas para practicar en mi vida personal. ¡Qué satisfecho me siento! Había leído y escuchado muy buenos comentarios de este libro por lo que mis expectativas eran altas, pero afortunadamente fue mejor de lo que esperaba. Desde la introducción me he sentido fascinado por la historia del autor, pero después, cada historia real y cada recomendación me ha parecido fantástica. El autor todo lo presenta de una forma tan sencilla, cada consejo parece ser mejor que el anterior, todo parece ideal; fórmula perfecta para alimentar el interés del lector no solo para seguir leyendo sino también para practicarlo en su vida real.Siempre había tenido la creencia de que crear un hábito es algo supremamente difícil pero después de esta lectura siento que he estado errado muchísimos años y que realmente es bastante sencillo. Siempre había buscado un método que me ayudara a centralizar mi vida, a clasificar lo bueno y lo malo, a encontrar un fortín desde el cual dirigir, y creo que eso es exactamente lo que he hallado en esta ocasión.Motivación, pragmatismo, sabiduría. Todo eso lo encontré aquí. Cuando realice la reseña completa contaré un poco cómo me ha ido después de aplicar en mi vida personal los principios de esta obra. Les contaré que buenos hábitos he logrado establecer. También les contaré cuáles han sido los negativos que he logrado abandonar.Libro súper recomendado. Reseña completa más adelante.!121!Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones is a practical framework for how to build and keep new habits. To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests:  - Make it Obvious - Make it Attractive - Make it Easy - Make it SatisfyingWhile at first glance these may seem overly simplistic, Atomic Habits delves into each of these concepts and also describes how these same ideas can be inverted to break bad habits. The content is easily digestible. Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated — Mastery requires practice. ”The only way to become excellent is to become endlessly fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.”Atomic Habits is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, in any facet of life, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes.!121!Ideea cărții este pe cât de simplă pe atât de adevărată și puternică și o aveți chiar în descrierea din subtitlu. Autorul folosește o mulțime de exemple pentru a arăta că: 1. Schimbările mici pot avea un impact foarte mare în viețile noastre. Dacă halești zilnic un burger de la Mec sau o găleată de pui de la Kafece, peste zece ani nu-ți va plăcea deloc ce vei vedea în oglindă și nici ce-ți va arăta cântarul. Dacă alergi juma de oră pe zi, lucrurile vor sta cu totul altfel. 2. Obiceiurile noastre sunt comportamente automate pe care le învățăm din experiență. Intri într-o cameră în care e întuneric, vei căuta automat întrerupătorul. De-aia, diferența pe termen lung o fac rutinele zilnice. Dacă ele sunt bune, rezultatul pe termen lung e excelent. 3. Construiești obiceiuri bune schimbând lucruri în viața ta și înconjurându-te de lucruri care declanșează acele obiceiuri pe care le vrei în viața ta. Eu nu am reușit să repet consistent la chitară, de pildă, până când nu am avut patru chitare, puse în locuri strategice: la masa din bucătărie la care stau destul de mult, la birou, în dormitor, în terasa de lângă casă, în care petrec ceva timp în weekend lucrând. La fel, cu exercițiile fizice. Am amenajat o sală la redacție, de care eu și colegul Marote profităm din plin, dar am și acasă ”matereale”, benzi elastice, gantere, kettlebell, saltea, bancă, ladă pentru sărituri, tot ce-mi trebuie pentru antrenamente complete și variate. Că dacă ești vineri, sâmbătă și duminică la grătare și șpriț nu vei putea schimba mare lucru la felul în care arăți. Fix la fel e și cu cititul și cu toate celelalte obiceiuri bune. 4. Ca să te țină, trebuie să faci obiceiurile atractive. Cum? Cu recompensă. Nu neapărat cum a făcut un inginer irlandez, care a legat o bicicletă de exersat acasă la computer, astfel încât Netflixul, de care omul era dependent, nu rula decât la o anumită viteză a bicicletei, dar trebuie să legi activitatea de un rezultat care îți face plăcere. Uite, eu, de pildă, pun periodic pe rețelele sociale poze după antrenamentele la sală. Iar faptul că oamenii apreciază munca pe care o fac pentru mine - da, oamenii se mulțumesc să-i aplaude pe alții, prea puțini se și apucă de treabă - mă încarcă și pe mine, astfel încât să pot continua. 5. Fă obiceiul accesibil, dacă vrei să îți fie ușor. La fel, fă-l inaccesibil, dacă e un obicei de care vrei să scapi. Uite, eu, de pildă, nu pot să adorm dacă nu mă uit la ceva film sau meci sau emisiune. Așa că primul pas a fost să scot cablul tv din dormitor. Apoi, am recurs la tabletă. Și am observat că dacă pun un film sau un meci nu adorm, mă ține treaz acțiunea. Așa că am luat cea mai bună decizie din viața mea: adorm seară de seară ascultând cursuri. Fie că e vorba de Masterclass, fie că e vorba de tot felul de prelegeri ale unor profesori puse pe yt (mare chestie yt premium, că nu te mai opresc reclamele), fie că e vorba de podcasturi, dau drumul și în cel mult zece minute adorm (asta și după ce am adoptat o rutină de respirație care induce somnul - inspir numărând până la patru, expir numărând până la 8, adormi ca un copil, tati!)6. Ține un jurnal cu schimbările pe care le faci, cu obiceiurile bune și cu efectele lor. Uite, a te poza periodic și a compara pozele este o bună metodă de a rămâne motivat, pentru că schimbările se văd de la o lună la alta, de la un anotimp la altul, de la un an la altul. Cam asta ar fi. Cei mai mulți dintre oameni eșuează în adoptarea unor obiceiuri bune pentru că vor rezultate imediate, pentru că nu au deloc răbdare și viziune, nu se pot vedea pe ei peste doi-trei ani, pentru că nu știu cum să rămână motivați, pentru că pun greșit problema. Uite, de pildă, mâncarea. În loc să ne preocupe în primul rând sănătatea, cum ne influențează sănătatea dieta, pe noi ne preocupă relațiile sociale și plăcerea pe care ne-o produce zahărul, de pildă. Sau alcoolul. Sau prăjelile de tot soiul, ori carnea în exces. Cât timp nu ne setăm mintea cum trebuie, cât timp nu ne stabilim clar prioritățile, nu vom putea să fim stăpânii propriei existențe. Vom fi doar consumatori, doar folosiți de marile companii, fără să ne dăm măcar seama.!121!Nope.

A Short History of Nearly Everything (Paperback),Bill Bryson,4.21,384015,2003,"Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller, but even when he stays safely at home he can't contain his curiosity about the world around him. ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" is his quest to understand everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilisation - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. The ultimate eye-opening journey through time and space, revealing the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.","A Short History of GoodreadsSurveys show that nearly 40% of all Americans believe the history of literature started in 2007, when Amazon sold the first Kindle; indeed, Amazon Fundamentalists hold it as an article of faith that Jeff Bezos actually wrote all the world's e-books over a period of six days. This is, of course, nonsense. It has been conclusively demonstrated that literature is far older than the Kindle; books already existed thousands of years ago, which were the direct ancestors of today's e-publications. For example, careful examination reveals that The Odyssey and The Gospel according to Saint Mark are primitive versions of Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters and Bared to You. Similar relationships have been shown to obtain for all modern books.Problems arise, however, from the fact that these archaic protobooks still exist today; indeed, some have adapted to the e-reader environment and begun to thrive there. It is entirely too easy for an unsuspecting internet shopper to purchase a copy of Pride and Prejudice, incorrectly believing that it is part of the Twilight series. From the standpoint of formal literary theory, it is admittedly incorrect to say that Pride and Prejudice is ""worse"" than Twilight. They are simply different; neither one is ""worse"" than the other, since they have developed in different environments. From a practical point of view, however, a person who buys a Jane Austen novel is almost certain to be disappointed. There are no vampires or werewolves; sex is barely even hinted at; most upsettingly of all, the book will be full of long sentences and difficult words. The combination of these factors can only lead to an intensely unpleasant reading experience, which may discourage the reader from making new Amazon purchases for days or even weeks afterwards. Particularly given the fragile state of the US economy, this is evidently not an acceptable state of affairs.People have always exchanged recommendations and warnings with their friends, but it became clear that a more systematic approach was needed. There had to be a place where book-consumers could post advice and help each other avoid these infuriating mistakes, so that everyone could be sure of reading nothing but up-to-the-minute YA erotic paranormal romances. Thus was born Goodreads.This work by Manny is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License!121!Good grief if I had even one textbook half this enthralling in high school, who knows what kind of impassioned -ologist I would have grown up to be. I hereby petition Bryson to re-write all curriculum on behalf of the history of the world.I would run across things half-remembered from midterms and study guides and think, ""You mean this is what they were talking about? You have got to be kidding me."" It's never condescending, always a joy.In fact, what I loved most is the acute, childlike sense of wonder seeping through the pages. How fantastic little we know about the world in which we live. All the great scientific leaps fallen through the cracks, all the billions of leaps that will never be made, every scientist who with an amiable grin shrugs to say, ""I don't know. We don't know. Who has any idea?"" The world is a magically baffling, enchanting place, and after nearly everything there is infinitesimally more.!121!Okay, so here's my Bill Bryson story. I was in The Gladstone, a public house not too far from this very keyboard, with my friend Yvonne, who will remain nameless. We had been imbibing more than freely. A guy approached our table and asked me in a sly surreptitious manner if I was him. Him who? Was I Bill Bryson? Now it is true that I bear a very slight resemblancebut you could also say that about Bjorn from Abbaand a zillion other white guys with beards and gently rounded fizzogs. Anyway, without missing a beat I said yes, I was him. So the guy immediately asked me if I'd sign two of his books, and before I could say ""Come on mate, I'm not actually American, can't you bleedin well tell?"" he had zapped out of the pub. Only to zap straight back with two hardbacks of Bill's deathless works. What could I do? He opened them up reverentially and told me one would be for him and one for his mother. Friends, I signed them - ""Best wishes, your friend Bill Bryson"". He was so grateful, so very very pleased. We drank up and got the hell out of there. I look back on this disgraceful incident and shudder. That's the last time I'm impersonating a famous author.Short note on the book in question:There was no way our Bill could write a gently humorous book about the history of all of science without sounding like a fairly smirky know-it-all, so that's what he does sound like, which can be just a trifle wearing. LOTS of good info in here, but it's like being forced to live on Indian takeaways and nothing else, great for a while and then GET ME A SANDWICH! Or like being stuck on a long airplane ride with a very garrolous and opinionated fellow who thinks he is the very model of the modern travelling companion, regaling you with insightful and humourous anecdotes by the bucketful while you're wondering if it would be so bad if you faked a heart attack and you could whisper to the flight attendant ""I'm okay really but GET ME AWAY FROM THIS GUY!""!121!What I learned from this book (in no particular order)1.	Phosphor was accidentally discovered when a scientist tried to turn human urine into gold. The similarity in color seemed to have been a factor in his conviction that this was possible. Like, duh. I’m no scientist, but shouldn’t it be obvious enough?2.	“In the early 1800s there arose in England a fashion for inhaling nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, after it was discovered that its use ‘ was attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling’. For the next half- century it would be the drug of choice for young people.” How groovy is that? 3.	If you are an average-sized adult, you contain within you enough potential energy to explode with the force of THIRTY very large hydrogen bombs. Assuming, that is, that you KNOW how to actually do this and REALLY want to make a point. Talk about a monstrous temper tantrum.4.	We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that some of our atoms probably belonged to Shakespeare, Genghis Khan or any other historical figure. But no, you are NOT Elvis or Marilyn Monroe; it takes quite a while for their atoms to get recycled.5.	When you sit in a chair, you are not actually sitting there, but levitating above it at the height of a hundredth millions of a centimeter. Throw away those yoga mats, your ARE already levitating without knowing it.6.	The atomic particles that we now know as Quarks were almost named Partons, after you know who. The image of Ms. Parton with her, uh, cosmic mammaries bouncing around the atomic nuclei is VERY unsettling.Thankfully, that scientist guy changed his mind.7.	The indigestible parts of a giant squid, in particular their beaks, accumulate in sperm whales’ stomachs into ambergris, which is used as a fixative in perfumes. The next time you spray on Chanel No. 5, you’re dowsing yourself in the distillate of unseen sea monsters. * Note to self: must throw away sea monster perfume collection*8.	The ‘maidenhair’ in maidenhair moss does NOT refer to the hair on the maiden’s head.BUT SERIOUSLY,this is a fascinating, accessible book on the history of the natural sciences, covering topics as diverse as cosmology, quantum physics, paleontology, chemistry and other subjects that have bedeviled a science dolt like me through high school and beyond. Yes, it’s true, I failed BOTH chemistry and physics in high school. I can't judge how accurate Mr. Bryson represents the sciences in this book, but it surely beats being bogged down in A Brief History of Time and their ilk.!121!يحكى أن يهوديا قرر الذهاب إلى دمياط للتجارة و حينما وصل إليها أراد اختبار أهلها قبل أن يبدأ مشروعه فأشار للصبى الذى أستأجره ليكون دليلا لهخذ هذا القرش فاشتر لنا غداء و شراب و حلوى و لا تنسى طعام للحمار و شيئا أتسلى به فى طريقىكان القرش لا يشترى بالكاد وجبة طعام لشخص واحد الا ان الشاب الدمياطى - و الدمياطى لمن لا يعرف كالخليلى فى الأدبيات الفلسطينية – ذهب إلى السوق و اشترى بطيخة بنصف قرش و أعاد لليهودى النصف الأخر قائلا لههى غداء لنا و فى نفس الوقت تحلية و شراب و نعطى للحمار قشرها و نتسلى بلبها طوال الطريقأدار اليهودى حماره عائدا و قال قوم مثل هذا لا يرجى من ورائهم مكسب.فلنترك هذه الحكاية و سأقص عليكم حكاية أخرى تخص بطيخة أخرىندخل فى الموضوع- طلبك عندى يا سيدنا الأفندىقالها أمين المكتبة الكهل و هو يعدل وضع نظارته ذات الغطاء السميك و ينظر بدهشة إلى هذا الفتى المتأنق الذى كان طلبه غريبا و مربكا بعض الشىء- أريد شيئا عن الكون و بدايته .. الإنفجار الكبير و المنظومة الشمسية ... النجوم و المستعرات الضوئية و النيازك .. المذنبات و تاريخها و كيف يمكن أن تهدد الأرض .. أريد أيضا أن أعرف كيف يقيسون هذه المسافات الشاسعة المقدرة بعشرات السنوات الضوئية.- عندى كتاب هيعجبك قوى بتاع هاوكينج. حاجه كده من الأخر- ألديك أيضا شيئا عن الأحافير و المسحاثات يكون سهل و شامل و فى نفس الوقت يشرح كيف انقرضت الديناصورات و كيف نقدر أعمار المستحاثات و فترات معيشتها و عصورها و التاريخ الجيولوجى للأرض- عندى كتاب هيعجبك و كمان مجموعة مقدمة قصيرة جدا فيها شوية كتب معقولين و خد كمان التحفة العلمية السمكة داخلك - طيب بالنسبة للكيمياء و الجدول الدورى للعناصر و اكتشاف اسرار المادة- لا دى بقى تاخد لها فيلم فيديو من ثلاث أجزاءhttps://youtu.be/jQmyR0hnd9c?list=PLg...- آينشتين و نيوتن و أساطين الفيزياء أسمع عنهم كثيرا فهل أجد لديك شيئا من أعمالهم و تأثيرهم فى العلم- عندى طبعا مجموعة كتب كويسة بس للأمانه بعضها لسه هقرأه بس بيشكروا فيها جامد- حسنا ماذا عن الذرة و تاريخها و الكواركس و ميكانيكا الكم و نظرية الأوتار الفائقة- عندى كتاب الثورة العلمية و كتاب الفيزياء المسلية هاجيبهم لك- أريد كتاب أيضا عن التلوث و حماية البيئة و كيف ساهم الإنسان فى ذلكو أيضا البراكين و الزلازل و الألواح التكتونية و تكون الجبال و الجزر أيضا أنا مهتم بها و بطريقة معرفتنا لها و توقعهاو لو توفر لديك شىء فى طبقات الجو و علوم الأرصاد الجوية و تأثيرات البحار و المحيطات على المناخ العالمى- لا دى صعب تلاقيها هنا- ماذا عن الخلية و الكائنات الدقيقة من ميكروبات و فيروسات و متعضيات و تكوينها و طريقة عملها و تصنيفها و تطورها- عندى كتب كتير هتعجبك من لويس باستير لتشارلز دارون للجينوم هتحتاج حوالى خمس كتب علشان تغطى الموضوع ده.كنت بالمصادفة جالسا فى نفس المكتبة بانتظار تغليف مجلد ميكى و منشغلا بقراءة عدد خاص من سلسلة رجل المستحيل و رغم ذلك تابعت الحوار الذى انتهى بأمين المكتبة الذى جهز حوالى خمسة عشر كتابا لهذا الشاباعتدلت قليلا و حييت الشاب و خاطبته قائلا- بقولك ايه يا معلم .. الكتب دى كتير جدا و شكلك لسه جديد فى السكة دىما تاخد موجز تاريخ كل شيء تقريبًاكتاب رائع و ممتع و مكتوب بإسلوب أدبى بليغ و هو ساخر أحيانا لدرجة الكوميديا. تجنب فيه المؤلف أى تعقيد علمى أو معادلات أو رسومات توضيحية و به كل ما تسأل عنه و زيادة فى حوالى خمسمائة صفحة من القطع المتوسطباختصار هتقرأه و تدعيلىهززت رأسى بثقة و نظرت إلى الشاب لأرى رد فعله على نصيحتى و لشدة دهشتى لم أجد لا شاب و لا مكتبة و وجدتنى ما زلت أسطر هذه المراجعة لهذا الكتاب الرائعلمدمنى البطيخ من أمثالى أهدى هذه البطيخة الحلوة المتنكرة فى صورة كتابو أخيرا بعض الإقتباسات1-الحياة من وجهة نظر الكيمياء2-ماذا لو لم نكن وحدنا فى هذا الكون الشاسع3-العلم قد لا يكون معقدا و لكن العلماء هكذا يفعلون4-5-6-7-8-9-ليس من السهل أن تكون عالما10-لماذا وجدت الحياة11-حتى كاميرون دياز ستجدها بين صفحات الكتاب!121!A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bill BrysonA Short History of Nearly Everything by American author Bill Bryson is a popular science book that explains some areas of science, using easily accessible language that appeals more so to the general public than many other books dedicated to the subject. Bryson describes graphically and in layperson's terms the size of the universe and that of atoms and subatomic particles. He then explores the history of geology and biology and traces life from its first appearance to today's modern humans, placing emphasis on the development of the modern Homo sapiens. Furthermore, he discusses the possibility of the Earth being struck by a meteorite and reflects on human capabilities of spotting a meteor before it impacts the Earth, and the extensive damage that such an event would cause. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «تاریخچه تقریبا همه چیز»؛ «شرح مختصری از همه چیز»؛ «علم و سرگذشت آن»؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز ششم ماه جولای سال 2005میلادیعنوان: تاریخچه تقریبا همه چیز؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ مترجم: محمدتقی فرامرزی؛ تهران، مازیار، 1384، در 615ص، شابک 9645676487؛ موضوع: علوم به زبان ساده از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: شرح مختصری از همه چیز؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ مترجم: محمود زنجانی؛ تهران، دایره المعارف ایرانشناسی، 1388، در 512ص، شابک9786005204155؛عنوان: علم و سرگذشت آن؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ مترجم: مجید عمیق؛ تهران، مهراب قلم کتابهای مهتاب، 1390، در 171ص، شابک9786001033636؛نویسنده درباره ی موضوعاتی گوناگون، از «مهبانگ» گرفته، تا «مکانیک کوانتوم»، و از «تکامل»، تا «زمین شناسی»، به بحث میپردازند؛ ایشان در کتابشان از راه ماجراهای «کاشفان» و «دانشمندان» موضوعات علمی را، به بحث میگذارد؛ ایشان در این کتاب کوشش میکنند برخلاف درسنامه های علمی، که به نظر ایشان، شوقی برای دانستن، در خوانشگران برنمیانگیزند، چرا که هیچگاه به چراها، چگونه ها و چه هنگام ها، در مورد اکتشافات علمی نمیپردازند، ایشان توانسه اند موضوعات علمی را به شکلی جذاب ارائه دهندنقل از متن: (نمیدانستم «پروتون» یا «پروتئین» چیست، «کوارک» را از «کواسار» تشخیص نمیدادم، نمیدانستم زمینشناسها چگونه میتوانند نگاهی به یک لایه از توده سنگ دیواره ی یک دره بیندازند، و عمر آن را تشخیص دهند، حقیقتاً هیچ چیز نمیدانستم؛ یک اشتیاق آرام و خارق العاده، برای یاد گرفتن، و دانستن برخی نکات، درباره ی این ��وضوعات، و دریافتن اینکه تا کنون چند نفر توانسته اند از آنها سر درآورند، آرام آرام بر وجودم چیره شد؛ این همواره بزرگترین شگفتی زندگی ام بوده است ـ دانشمندان چگونه از مسائل سر درمیآورند...)؛ پایان نقل؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 11/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 29/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Picked this up on audiobook when I was on tour and listened to it in my car.

And even though I knew a fair chunk of what was mention, there was a lot of material I'd never even had a glimmer of before. Fair warning: If you are prone to worry about, say, the end of the world. This probably isn't the book for you.!121!Bryson's dead serious: this is a history of pretty much everything there is -- the planet, the solar system, the universe -- as well as a history of how we've come to know as much as we do. A book on science written by a non-scientist, this a perfect bridge between the humanities and the natural sciences. A course in the history of science should be mandatory for every teenager, and this should be the textbook.Yes, it's a big, chunky book. No, it can't be trimmed down any further: when you're addressing cosmology, earth science, ecology and zoology, with healthy doses of chemistry and physics, plus the historical development of each, you're going to end up with a doorstop of a text, no matter how smoothly written. The wonder of Bryson's writing is that the reader doesn't get lost in these sweeping surveys. When name-dropping, Bryson always gives a short description of the person in question; if mentioned earlier in the book, he drops in a quick reminder to the reader. This is fabulously effective at giving the names some context, not to mention a little personality.And indeed, isn't that what science education needs most: more humanity and less intimidation? Those science-phobes out there who freely admit their near-complete ignorance of the subject should do themselves a favor and buy a copy of this book. No, don't get it from your library. There's so much here you'll want to have a copy on hand to refer to later.To those nerds in the audience -- myself included -- don't think your degrees mean you can pass this one over. As hyper-specialized as science has become, it's refreshing as hell to step back and take a look at things with new eyes. While there's not a lot here I haven't encountered before, there's a lot of information about how our current theories were developed that I didn't know.(Also? It's heartening to read about the social ineptitude, blind spots, and how utterly incompetent many of these scientist were in other aspects of life. Makes me feel better about never finishing that PhD -- at least I have a life.)Thorough, humorous, engaging, and educational: what's not to like?!121!It's easy to nitpick A Short History of Nearly Everything. Bryson, by his own cheerful admission anything but a scientist, makes a fair number of mistakes. He says that all living creatures contain hox genes; he omits Alexander Friedmann and George Gamow from his description of how the Big Bang theory was developed; when talking about Darwin and Paley, he doesn't seem to be aware that Natural Theology was one of Darwin's favorite books and had a huge influence on him. Those are just a few of the glitches I happened to notice. I'm sure a real expert would have spotted many more.But so what? The author is incredibly entertaining, and I came across dozens of great stories from the history of science. He has done a fantastic job of tracking down details that you won't find in the other books! Continuing with Darwin, everyone's heard about the evolution debate between T.H. Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce; this was the dozenth time I'd seen Huxley's contemptuous reply to Wilberforce's question about whether he claimed descent from a monkey though his grandmother or his grandfather. But I'd never before read that Lady Brewster fainted, or that one of Darwin's Beagle colleagues wandered through the crowd, holding a Bible aloft and shouting ""the Book, the Book!"" Similarly, everyone tells you that Newton only published the Principia after Halley persuaded him to do it. But I hadn't heard that Newton intentionally made it as difficult as possible to read because he didn't want amateurs bothering him, or that Halley's reward was to be told by the Royal Society that since they could no longer afford to pay his salary in pounds sterling, he would instead be given remaindered copies of The History of Fishes. And there were numerous other stories I'd never seen at all. If you don't find plenty here to amuse and instruct, you're either encyclopedically well-read in all branches of science or you have no interest in it whatsoever.!121!Big bois. Long bois. Extra extra page bois.Everyone's heard of them. The Libraries are full of them. But are they worth it?Click the link for my video review of the big bois in my life.The Written Review:Want a whirlwind worldwide romance adventure minus the romance? This is the book for you.This book really does cover nearly everything. From the Big Bang to current life on earth, Bill Bryson does wonderful job of breaking down complex theories and concepts to their essential message:
Protons give an atom its identity, electrons its personality.
Though, sometimes he  gets a bit wordy.
Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result -- eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly -- in you.
This was such an interesting book to read and I walked away learning so much. This is the sort of book that requires two or three times reading through it to fully understand and digest everything. I can barely comprehend how much time and effort went into research. Truly a masterpiece. Audiobook Comments:While he did not narrate his own book, the Richard Matthews does a great job of reading it. Though, this is one of those books that you cannot tune out on without missing something crucial. This is a great big-picture book. For a fun microhistory, I'd recommend  At Home: A Short History of Private Life also by Bill Bryson.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!A Short History of Nearly Everything is Bill Bryson's summation of life, the universe, and everything, a nice little easy-reading science book containing an overview of things every earthling should be aware of.As I've repeatedly mentioned over the years, every time one of the casual-readers tells me I have to read something, like Harry Potter or the DaVinci Code, I dig my feet in deeper and resolve to never read it. This is one of the occasions I should have shaved a decade off of my stubbornness and caved in right away.Bryson covers a wide range of topics, from the formation of the universe to the evolution of man for our apelike forebears, and all points in between. Atoms? Cells? These are just stops along the enlightenment highway that Bill Bryson has paved! He touches upon quantum physics, geology, the size of our solar system, the year without a summer, and other topics innumerable.The writing style is so accessible that I have to think I'd be some kind of scientists if my high school and college text books were written by Bill Bryson. His easy, breezy style makes even the most complicated topics easier to digest.It's not often that I come away from a book having felt like I learned something new, criminal techniques from my usual reads excepted. Bryson has succeeded where many have failed before him. He has used chicanery to get me to read nonfiction and enjoy myself while doing it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.!121!This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. There, I said itBryson's book combines the best qualities of science writers like Attenborough, Diamond, Durrell, and Wilson; presenting the information with the wit he is most known for. It is an amazing achievement to condense the entire base of human scientific knowledge into 478 pages, but Bryson has done it. I completely agree with Tim Flannery, who writes on the jacket that ""all schools would be better places if it were the core science reader on the curriculum."" I certainly would have gained much if I had read it when I was 15.This is one of the few books that has truly challenged what I had previously held to be conventional wisdom (at least in my own mind). Two main changes have come about: 1. I had always been jealous of the ""true"" zoologists, such as Audubon and Darwin, who were around when the world was as yet unexplored, and discovering a species was as simple as being the first to walk into a patch of forest. I left science because the idea of being tied to a sterile lab held no interest for me. However, after reading Bryson's vignettes of early scientific/zoological exploration (much of which was both comic and tragic), I realize that those days weren't quite as idyllic as I had imagined. 2. Bryson does a ""good"" job of scaring the hell out of you by showing just how precarious our daily existence really is. I probably shouldn't say this, but it puts such problems as global climate change into context when you read how an eruption of the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park would wipe out most of the life on earth in a painfully slow manner; especially when Bryson describes how this eruption is overdue by 30, 000 years by historical average.Combined with those two new impressions, I am left with the following conclusions, and a slightly rearranged outlook on life.First off, it is clear that science benefits from a large degree of serendipity. We as a species/civilization have been lucky to have some truly great minds working on deciphering the way our world works. Some of these are household names [Newton, Halley, Einstein], some are not [Henry Cavendish, Rosalind Franklin]. However, as with everything that us humans put our hands on, this endeavor wasn't perfect. Egregious mistakes, pathological lying, childlike rivalries and tantrums - they all occurred. On balance, whether they helped or hurt the effort isn't clear. But what is clear is that our present level of understanding was by no means assured.Secondly, the fact that life is so tenuous makes one a little more philosophical. Since I've finished the chapter about Yellowstone and similar catastrophic threats, I find myself asking ""what if today is the day?"" It can be rough when you get on the bus at the end of a particularly annoying workday, when the disagreements were petty and you didn't get much done, and think ""is that what I did on the last day of my life?""Thankfully, that attitude only lasted for a short while, until I was able to reframe it in a more productive way. Now I tell myself not to worry about big problems that might happen in the future, because I know that we will be hit by a meteor, we will experience a supervolcano eruption. It's best to just enjoy every day, doing what you really know to be what it is that you want to do. Does that mean that I won't recycle anymore, that I will leave the tap running while I brush my teeth? No! Because doing things to reduce my impact makes me feel good, that I'm thinking about society's needs - not just my own. It's what I want to do.So, in an incredible way (that even Bill Bryson probably didn't predict) this book can really change your life.!121!I was never any good at science. At the grammar school I attended we were shepherded into laboratories for lessons on physics, chemistry and biology. These were scary places; I’d never been anywhere like this before. The physics lab had gas taps and Bunsen burners and the walls were filled with incomprehensible charts. The chemistry lab held rows of specimen jars, more gas taps and burners and an underlying smell of something unpleasant and vaguely dangerous. The biology lab displayed pictures and diagrams of human body parts and there were constant rumours of creature dissections and other nasty things to come. Beyond the physical fears it was clear that each subject had its own language. I was fluent in none of them. I ceased study on all of these subjects at the earliest opportunity.But I left school feeling that I’d missed out on part of my core education. And I had. So I’d had my eye on this book for some time. I’ve long been a fan of Bryson’s insightful yet amusing take on the world. Surely his commentary of all things scientific couldn’t be too painful, could it? The book walks through just about every significant scientific discovery from the creation of the universe to the present day. Well, not quite the present day, given this book was published some fourteen years ago. But given the universe is currently thought to be some 13.7 billion years old, I’m comfortable it covers the mother lode.The list of sciences included is exhaustive, I spotted whole bunch but I’m also convinced I missed a few. My list comprises:AnthropologyAstronomyBotanyCosmologyChemistryEcologyGeologyHuman BiologyMeteorologyOceanographyPhysicsZoologyIt’s fascinating stuff – staggering, in fact. I’d heard of the Big Bang theory, of course, but I’d never delved into the detail of it. The explanation here is clear and concise - it’s still mind bending, but I was able to follow most of the explanation. There were some sections where the detail did become a little heavy – the account of plant life being categorised lumbered on interminably – but on the whole the pacing felt spot on. It’s also very well structured, with relevant topics being grouped together. It flowed well and told a compelling story.As I worked my way through this book, the thought that kept leaping to the fore was that these brilliant theories and discoveries came about largely as a result of scientists and non-scientists working something out via observation, association and calculation – the kicker being that nearly all of these milestone events predate computers, email and the internet. It’s incredible. In one example twenty years was spent on a calculation using pencil, paper and a slide rule. The same calculation could now be completed using a computer in a single day. Yes, because of its publication date there are a few recent finds that aren’t included - confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson particle in 2012 is one example – but I really don’t think it missed out too much of any significance. For anyone looking for a comprehensive but easy to follow history of scientific discovery, from the very beginning, look no further. I can’t recommend this book highly enough.!121!This book explains everything from a little proton atom to Bing Bang's theory. It tells more about popular science than the history of everything.I found it interesting and also challenging to understand all the science jargon and theories.For those who want to know more about our universal, I recommend you to read this book. I like the history of Charles Darwin's life particularly and the discovery of his theory of evolution.!121!Oh my gods, what a waste of perfectly good paper! I am flabbergasted that this has such consistently high reviews...Three problems with this tripe: 1. falsity of the science (most blatantly around cosmology, but not limited to any one field) and misunderstanding of scientific principles;2. a focus more on ""biography"" rather than on real ""history"";3. trivial worthlessness of the information.Number 1 is briefly chronicled below. Within just the first 20 pages or so, there are ridiculous factual errors and misrepresentations of scientific knowledge. Even in 2003 when the book was published, these errors would have been unforgivable. Where the bloody hell were the editors?! Apparently the author came out later to mention his ""lack of scientific chops,"" or the like. How can a book about the history of science fuck up the science?!Number 2 is just downright sad. Apparently the author felt that if he could spend about a page per scientist, he would make the material more interesting. No, man, I want science and history, not abbreviated and hackneyed biography. He doesn't even move smoothly between people... it's just a meandering of random scientific endeavors, somewhat brought into chronology.Number 3 is a difficult criticism, because with this kind of book, it is hard to get away from misc. trivia. And I'll even acknowledge that I learned a lot of trivia... and that the book does a great job of showing us just how much we don't know. But as I reached page 360 and realized (for the fifth or so time) that this was info that I could get in a quick google search, I just couldn't do it anymore. What a gods awful waste. What's more disappointing than the book though, is the overwhelming praise the book has gotten. I don't even want to sell this book back, but throw it away (and I thought I would never say something like that)! I'd rather have someone go slightly ignorant than have them be fed this mess of misinformation and dredge.Below were reactions I had when reading was ""in progress.""Start (05/08/11):Okay, so the ""approachable textbook""... does it live up to the hype? Every review I have seen is about how great this book is. Let's see.So far, this book shows its 2003 date by providing currently inaccurate data; I also did not realize the author would assume zero scientific knowledge on the part of the reader... this could be interesting.Finally, the Introduction is full of annoying straw men and non-sequitors that really make me wonder if the author has learned much about scientific inquiry at all. He really doesn't understand probability. Eh, I'm only on page 16. Let's see if this improves.(05/09/11)Oh, bloody frak. ""In the long term, *gravity* may turn out to be a little too strong, and one day it may halt the expansion of the universe and bring it collapsing in upon itself, till it crushes itself down into another singularity... On the other hand it may be too weak and the universe will keeping racing away..."" (emphasis mine) NOTHING about those statements is correct. Gravity has nothing to do with the expansion of spacetime. Ugh, I thought this book had fantastic reviews! The term he is talking about here is ""dark energy,"" NOT gravity.""Astronomers these days can do the most amazing things. If someone struck a match on the Moon, they could spot the flare.""... You have got to be fucking kidding me. A redox oxidation in a vacuum. Dude...Oh my frak. He just lost all respect from me. ""...even with the most conservative inputs [in the Drake equation] the number of advanced civilzations... always works out to be somewhere in the millions."" Fucking no. Dude, how the hell did this even get published?!!121!"" تبارك الله أحسن الخالقين "" هذا ما ستنطقه شفتاك حين تنتهي من كل فصل من فصول هذا الكتاب ستشعر بكم العجز الذي نحن فيه ليس لنصنع أو نبتكر إنما فقط لنفهم كيف تسير الأمور في هذا الكونستجد من بين السطور مقولات كهذه "" إنه عالم يتجاوز الفهم بالنسبة لمعظمنا ""وبالنسبة للكتاب فهو كتلة من الابداع غزارة المعلومات ودقة التفاصيل ولو قرر المؤلف أن يسترسل بكتابته 6000 صفحة بدلا من 600 لاستطاع ذلك من قوة الامتاع في السرد والمؤلف أكاد أجزم أنه كان عبارة عن موسوعة متحركة من المعلومات فمن يكتب هكذا كتاب يجب أن يكون موسوعة وليس كاتب ومؤلف فقط و كم من الكتب والابحاث والمراجع قد قرأ ليصل لهذا الكم من المعلومات وسأحرص أن أت��بع بقية مؤلفاته لعلي أجد ما فقدته حين أنهيت هذا الكتابأنصح الجميع به!121!موجز تاريخ كل شيء تقريباً رغم الترجمة التي تكبو أحياناً، ورغم ما يقال بأن هناك فصل سقط في الترجمة!! إلا أن هذا كتاب عظيم بحق، عمل مبهر ولذيذ، وضع بيل برايسون هذا الكتاب للإجابة على الأسئلة العلمية التي يجهلها حول الأرض والطبيعة بشكل عام، هذه الأسئ��ة التي انهالت عليه وهو يحدق في البحر من نافذة طائرة، تحولت إلى رحلة ممتعة، له ولنا، فبرايسون لا يرهقنا بالحقائق العلمية كأنما هو موسوعة، وإنما يدسها لنا في حكايات متشابكة، عن العلم والعلماء في سعيهم للفهم، وبناء كل تلك العلوم من الجذاذات التي بين أيديهم، لهذا تشعر بالاهتمام والتواطؤ ومن ثم بالامتنان لكل تلك الجهود التي قام بها العلماء، ويتحول العلم بالنسبة لك من مادة ثقيلة إلى مادة حية، مشبعة بالإنسان، طموحاته وآلامه وسعيه للحقيقة والمعرفة، هذا الكتاب رحلة ممتعة، لا تفوتوها.!121!Well deserving of its popularity and praise, this book manages to be fun even though it contains a massive amount of information delivered at a rapid rate. The title is hyperbolic; this is an introduction to scientific building blocks that will give the reader a basic understanding about the world, our place within it, and of the history behind major scientific discoveries. Though it has the ability to make one feel overwhelmed, I think it has an equal potential to be a good kicking off point for further readings about science.!121!2.5 Stars This is probably going to make me sound as thick as two short planks but I didn't like it, I knew going into this book that it was going to be a challenge as Science is not really my preferred bedtime reading but I do think its good to try new things but unfortunately yes this was just hard work for me and I struggled through this one. But on the plus side I did learn some STUFF just dont ASK me to EXPLAIN it to you and it did encourage discussion with my Nerdy other half which cant be a bad thing and there are quite a few amazing facts in the book and some entertaining stories. I will probably tell the other half that I gave it 5 stars :-) This book is extremely well written and researched and for those interested in science I am sure this is an amazing read as Bill Bryson travels through time and space to explain the world, the universe and everything. I don't regret picking it up this book and giving it a go and my rating only reflects my reaction to the book and certainly not the quality of the information or how it is presented.I would like to read something else (less challenging) by this author so perhaps I will pick up another one of his books sometime in the future.!121!11/10 - a book everyone should read simply because of the knowledge it imparts to the reader. This is one of those books where I realised after a few pages that I couldn't even plan to write this book, let alone put the words on to the page. A stunning achievement and if I had to recommend one anecdote, it would be Edmond Halley (of comet fame) going to see Isaac Newton about the path the Earth follows around the sun. Halley and Christopher Wren (in the time when he was a famous mathematician / astronomer before he became a famous architect) and Robert Hooke (the man who proved the law of elasticity) couldn't agree on the path - was it a circle, an ellipse, a parabola?Isaac was able to prove what kind of curve the Earth took around the sun, however he couldn't put his hand on the written-down proof because his desk wasn't too tidy, so Isaac wrote it down again and sent the proof to Edmond Halley.!121!A short history of nearly everythingThis is a remarkable accomplishment. From the author, of course, but also from me, to have read it. I'm not a scientist, so when I started reading this book, I expected that I would skip some parts. But I didn't ; I read every single page of this highly readable and enjoyable book. I won't bother you with all the scientific stuff I learned. Instead, I compiled a top 5 list of the frightful fates of some scientists. 1. Max Planck (1858-1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose work on quantum theory won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1918. Max Planck had to deal with many tragedies in his life. His beloved first wife, Marie, died at a young age in 1909, probably from TBC. They had four children (with his second wife Magda he had a fifth child Hermann). During the first world war, his son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his other son Karl was killed in action at Verdun. His daughter Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child, and two years later her twin sister Emma died the same way, after having married Grete's widower. In February 1944 his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. In 1945, Erwin was sentenced to death by the Nazi Volksgerichtshof and executed, because of his participation in the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in july 1944. His death destroyed much of Max Planck's will to live.Tragic2. Doctor Thomas Midgley Jr. (1889 – 1944) was an American mechanical engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in a team of chemists that developed the lead additive to gasoline (TEL) as well as some of the first CFCs. His work led to the release of large quantities of lead into the atmosphere as a result of the large-scale combustion of leaded gasoline all over the world. Thomas Midgley Jr. died three decades before the ozone-depleting and greenhouse gas effects of CFCs in the atmosphere became widely known. Bill Bryson remarked that Midgley possessed ""an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny"". In 1940, at the age of 51, Midgley contracted poliomyelitis, which left him severely disabled. This led him to devise an elaborate system of strings and pulleys to help others lift him from bed. This system was the eventual cause of his own death when he was entangled in the ropes of this device and died of strangulation at the age of 55. Horrible3. Gideon Mantell (1790 – 1852) was an English obstetrician, geologist and paleontologist. He and his wife discovered several large teeth of an Iguanodon in 1822, but they were dismissed as belonging to a fish or mammal or rhinoceros, by other scientist. Mantell was mocked by his peers, and especially sir Richard Owen (the coiner of the word ""dinosaur"") made his life a hell. Mantell became financially destitute and his wife left him in 1839. His son emigrated to New Zealand that same year, and his daughter died in 1840. In 1841 Mantell was the victim of a terrible carriage accident in London. Somehow he fell from his seat, became entangled in the reins and was dragged across the ground. Mantell suffered a debilitating spinal injury. He became bent, crippled and in constant pain. Richard Owen took advantage from this and tried to ruin Mantell's reputation as an important contributor to the science of paleontology. In fact, Owen even transferred claim of a number of discoveries from Mantell to himself. Mantell could no longer bear the pain of his spine and the burden of Owen’s hatred and on 10 November 1852, Mantell took an overdose of opium and later lapsed into a coma. He died that afternoon. An anonymous obituary appeared shortly afterwards in the Literary Gazette, which denigrated Mantell’s achievements and claimed his scientific work was no more than mediocre at best – although anonymous, the style of the obituary quickly identified it as coming from Owen’s pen. Then, as a final act of indignity, Owen had a section of Mantell's spine removed and displayed his pickled spine in a jar in his museum. Dreadful4. Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) was a German polar reseacher, geophysicist and meteorologist. Today he is most remembered as the originator of the theory of continental drift by hypothesizing in 1912 that the continents are slowly drifting around the Earth. Wegener's fourth and last Greenland expedition was in 1930. The 14 participants under his leadership were to establish three permanent stations from which the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet could be measured and year-round Arctic weather observations made. Success depended on enough provisions being transferred from West camp to Eismitte (""mid-ice"") for two men to winter there, and this was a factor in the decision that led to his death. On 24 September, although the route markers were by now largely buried under snow, Wegener set out with thirteen Greenlanders and his meteorologist Fritz Loewe to supply the camp by dog sled. During the journey, the temperature reached −60 °C (−76 °F) and Loewe's toes became so frostbitten they had to be amputated with a penknife without anesthetic. Twelve of the Greenlanders returned to West camp. On 19 October the remaining three members of the expedition reached Eismitte. There being only enough supplies for three at Eismitte, Wegener and Rasmus Villumsen took two dog sleds and made for West camp. They took no food for the dogs and killed them one by one to feed the rest until they could run only one sled. While Villumsen rode the sled, Wegener had to use skis, but they never reached the camp: Wegener died and Villumsen was never seen again. Wegener died probably of a heart attack (Bill Bryson wrote he froze to death). Villumsen buried Wegener’s body in the snow and marked the grave with skis. Villumsen then resumed his journey, but did not complete it. His body was never found. In May 1931, after a search, Kurt Wegener discovered his brother’s grave. He and other expedition members built a pyramid-shaped mausoleum in the ice and snow, and Alfred Wegener’s body was laid to rest in it. The mausoleum has now, with the passing of time, been buried under Greenland’s ice and snow.Terrible5. Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) was an American astronomer who is known for playing a vital role in the development of extragalactic astronomy. What became of Edwin Hubble after his death at his home on the 28th of September 1953, is a mystery. The whereabouts of his body were known only to his widow. It is not known whether he was buried or cremated or where his remains now lie. This secret his widow took to her own grave. His wife who adored him, devoted years of her life to writing an almost mythical account of her husband's life, much of which is evidently false.Creepy9/10!121!What I appreciated most about this book is that it recognizes the lesser-known pioneers of our time. To be more precise, the book in large part, introduces and acknowledges some of the barely known Western scientists (along with the famous ones) that researched, discovered, and in part laid out the foundation for modern astronomy, geology, paleontology, chemistry, physics, biology, but never received the deserved recognition!The author answers the questions, how and with whom, we arrived at the scientific knowledge we know today, and what those results are. The book very briefly discusses the evolution of the cosmos and our planetary system and in more details the evolution of planet Earth and its living organisms. We also see that the field of science, like in any other field of profession, is full of greed, deceit, and bitterness.As far as the title and content of the book is concerned, I have my remarks. The book is called A Short History of Nearly Everything and it only covers science and scientists. Not what I expected.Also, not introducing and discussing, in a history of science book, the Mesopotamian, ancient Egyptians and Greeks, Mesoamerican civilization, the Islamic Golden Age period, and others, deprives the reader from seeing and grasping the whole picture of the chronological development of the study of the physical and natural world. Lastly, all the short stories revolve around Western European and North American scientists. Which I personally love and appreciate. For example, as far as Asia is concerned, the author dedicated space within the book to inform us that Tokyo could be expecting a devastating earthquake, and the Asian shark finning cruel practice brings in their restaurants up to $100+ per bowl of shark fin soup. But, no mention of Asian scientists, and their achievements.Therefore, in general the content of the book can be viewed as US-Eurocentric, which in return presents the reader with a short-sighted view of the history of science, all wrapped up in an ambiguous title.Not to end on a negative note, Bryson is an enjoyable storyteller and the many short stories, along with the science lessons, nicely flow together. Bryson is not a scientist, but he did a fine job.(3.5/5)!121!The best thing about this book is that it introduces other books you would like. It showed me that I should probably read more about Newton and Einstein, and that astronomy is something that I am still interested in. I did find myself scanning through certain sections because I already understood them well (the vastness of the universe) or I don't think I will ever understand them (complicated aspects of biology). Like all science book, they get outdated fast but this one is still holding up, at least for now.!121!Stunning in scope and execution. Loved every page of it, even geology was made exciting. That really is some feat.!121!از عنوان شروع کنیمعنوان کتاب تقریبا گویای همه‌چیز هست. نویسنده نزدیک سه سال به شکل حیرت‌آوری حجم عظیمی از کتاب‌های علمی توی رشته‌های مختلف رو خونده و به جاهای مختلف سر زده و تقریبا توی تمام شاخه‌های اصلی علم روز دنیا حداقل سی چهل صفحه‌ای نوشتهآیا این کتاب ارتباطی به ما دارد؟خوب. این یه سوال جدی برای من بود. چون شخصا هیچ ارتباطی با کتاب‌های علمی نداشتم و ندارم. اما خیلی وسوسه‌انگیزه که کتابی رو بخونی که توش عصاره‌ی همه‌ی علوم گنجونده شده باشه. کتاب‌هایی که به این شکل وجه دایره‌المعارفی دارن این فرصت رو به خواننده‌هاشون میدن که با یه مطالعه‌ی مختصر راجع‌به این شاخه‌ها حوزه‌ی مورد علاقه‌ی خودشون رو پیدا کننآیا کتاب خوبی است؟توی مرورهایی که روی کتاب نوشته شده ایرادهایی رو بهش وارد کردند. با همه‌ی این احوال قطعا تاریخچه‌ی تقریبا همه چیز کتاب خوبیه. نویسنده انسان شوخ و دوست‌داشتنی‌ای هست و سعی کرده جا به جا از اتفاق‌های جالب علمی بگه که شاید توی متون ""رسمی"" علمی هیچ‌وقت ازشون صحبتی به میون نمیاد [بخش‌هایی از همین تیکه‌ها رو تو استتوس‌هام می‌تونید پیدا کنید]. دیگه این‌که نویسنده یه نیم‌نگاه خیلی جدی داشته به تاریخ غیررسمی علوم مورد بحث و سعی کرده از کسایی هم اسم ببره که در اثر بی‌توجهی مردم روزگارشون یا دزدیده شدن طرح یا ایده‌شون به شهرت واقعی و درخور فعالیت‌شون نرسیدن. دنیای دانشمندها اون‌قدرها که فکر می‌کنیم دنیای اخلاقی‌ای نبوده...آخر کارکتاب دوست‌داشتنی و خوش‌خونی هست با یه ترجمه‌ی خوب. هرچند که انتظار داشتم بخش مربوط به حیات موجودات زنده‌ش جذاب‌تر از این باشه. اما در کل یکی از بهترین گزینه‌ها برای یه آدم غیرمتخصص [مثل من] هست که ببینه بالای سرش، زیر پاش و توی بدنش چه دنیاهایی هست...!121!A fascinating history of science. Ever curious how everything we know about the world came to be - read this! I loved reading about what old greats like Darwin thought about the world - they were all right about most things, but also very wrong about some things - makes you wonder how much we are wrong about today!Another interesting piece was how many of the world's prominent scientists had the time to do their research because they came from rich families. Very different from todays notion of 'trust funders'.!121!*3.5 stars *!121!این کتاب هم متاسفانه خسته کننده بود، دغدغه نویسنده این بود که چرا در کتب علمی نحوه رسیدن به حقایق بیان نمیشه. سر همین جزئیات خیلی حوصله سر بری رو از زندگی دانشمندا و پروسه رسیدنشون به تئوری ها مخصوصا تئوری های اشتباه رو بیان کرده بود. و یه مشکل دیگه این بود که قصد داشت مسائل علمی رو مثل محاسبه حجم کره زمین، قدمت زمین و ... بیش از حد ساده سازی کنه سر همین ادم اخر متوجه نمیشد که خب چرا فلان دانشمند به این عدد رسید. بعضی بخش های محدودی جالب بود ولی خب خوندن این کتاب صرفا تخمین محدودی از یه سری تئوری که درستی غلطیش هنوز مورد بحثه به شما میده نه تاریخ ""همه چیز"".نویسنده مطالبی رو که صرفا هم تئوریک بیان شده بود بدون شواهد اماری صرفا به دلیل اجماع دانشمندا روی اون تئوری به عنوان حقیقت بیانش کرده بود.!121!First off, this is a huge departure from Bryson's breezy, excellent travel logs. Secondly, this book should be read with some frequency. It is so densely packed with valuable insight, and sound bites of discovery that you could not possibly absorb it all with one pass. This is my second time reading it and I plan on doing it again next year. The organizational structure is a wonderful series of loosely connected cameos covering several essential and enlightened discoveries of man. As an added bonus, the book actually attempts to pay off on the cheeky title. Bryson's light, common man’s writing style “scats” from universal, to global, to biological with a loosely constructed cause and effect outline. His books (thankfully, including this one) are all peppered with wit and charm and a heavy snatch of sarcasm. Further and maybe more importantly, he has the good sense to skip over heavy deep dives into mathematics, theories or anything at an ivy graduate level. I love this guy. I feel like he wrote this book for me and I hope he writes 10 more just like this. 10/4/07I abhor cliches, but in honor of Bryson's incredible achievement I'll indulge in one. I might very well choose ""A Short History"" as the ONE book I'd choose over all others ...if ...I was stranded on the proverbial desert island. Bryson has created a true encyclopedic kaleidoscope. Imagine the fun he had writing this book as he allowed his mind to logically wormhole through and across time!!121!حقیقت مأیوس‌کننده‌ای که با خواندن برخی کتاب‌ها گریبان‌گیرم می‌شود این است که چگونه یک نظام مدون آموزشی و پژوهشی و همچنین شرایط متناسب جامعه، باعث می‌شود چهره‌ها، استعدادها و مسیرها برای تحقق یک کشف مهیا شوند. بسیاری از چهره‌ها از علاقه‌های جزئی به سمت اکتشافات بزرگ کشانده می‌شوند. از جمع‌آوری صدف و سنگریزه و گیاه به اکتشاف و چاپ مقاله و تحقیق می‌رسند. جالب است که اغلب این چهره‌ها نه نبوغ آن‌چنانی دارند و نه وجه تمایزی برجسته، تنها و تنها علاقه دارند و اشتیاق. چیزی که مردم این‌جا هم دارند. اما مسیرها به کجا می‌روند و چه شرایطی مهیا می‌شود، جواب سوال است. به‌قول فروغ اینجا راه‌ها ادامۀ خود را در تیرگی رها کردند... ما زمین و آسمان را تبدیل کردیم به دانشگاه، سر خیابان‌ها مقاله و پایان‌نامه می‌فروشیم. حراجِ هر روزه زده‌ایم به دانش و تولید دانش، با شعارهایی هزاران برابر بدتر. ما هر سال‌مان را با «شعار» شروع می‌کنیم، شعار دانش، شعار برتری، شعار پیشرفت، شعارِ عمل! و سالی که با شعار شروع می‌شود، نکو بودنش از بهارش پیداست!امیدوارم روزی برسد که اشتیاقِ هر کسی {نه روابط و ضوابط و حتی نبوغ فردی} به تبحر در دانش و پژوهش برسد.","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Physics', 'Popular Science']"
We Should All Be Feminists (Kindle Edition),Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,4.4,290151,2012,"What does “feminism” mean today? That is the question at the heart of We Should All Be Feminists, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun. With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.","This is the single most convincing essay I’ve ever read on feminism. It does not point fingers and blame men for a cultural mind-set they were born into. Instead, it offers calm logical arguments for positive change going forward. And that’s what the world needs:
“A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: We must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.”
Adichie states that the strongest feminist she ever knew was a man, and that’s kind of important. This is an essay about building bridges; it appeals directly to men and asks them to look at the world differently: it ask them to look at their actions, ones which were harmless and indirect, but were nevertheless sexist: it tries to make them open their eyes.“The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn’t have the weight of gender expectations.”“I am trying to unlearn many lessons of gender I internalized while growing up. But I sometimes still feel vulnerable in the face of gender expectations.”Gender is the key. Adichie gives an example of how when she first became a teacher she wore male orientated clothing on her first day. She wore a suit so the students would take her more seriously rather than just dressing in a way that made her comfortable. She sacrificed her individuality because of gender expectations. In order to be more authoritative she dressed like a man because a woman would not have had as much respect in such a situation. And that’s truly sad. The same is true for men who feel unable to express their emotions because such a thing is considered weak and unmanly. We all have the capacity to feel and the fact that fiery emotions are considered a feminine trait is just, well, odd. But that’s the world we live in. Adichie proposes that we ignore such stupid labels and be whoever we wish to be: we are ourselves. There’s so much negative stigma attached to the word feminist. This book is the true face of modern feminism, read it and you will not be able to fault its logic.
We should all be feminists after.

And an acquaintance told me that it was an angry article, and I should not have made it so angry. But I was unapologetic. Of course it was angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. I am angry. We should all be angry.
A short, sharp, and effective essay about gender, the wrong ideas many people have about feminism, and why it is so damn important. Even today.I suppose an ""essay"" doesn't sound like something most people want to rush out and read. It sounds like a chore, like hard work, like something that you should maybe read... someday... if you ever get around to it. But this doesn't feel like an essay at all. The author delivers a compelling and deeply personal account of her experiences and the experiences of her friends - male and female, young and old, Nigerian and American. She makes many fantastic points and makes them in a conversational tone, without seeming preachy or patronizing. Looking at the way we treat women and men, and how the expectations we have of both genders is contributing to a gender divide, the author makes an argument for a better future where we are not put into gendered boxes.
We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.
I've actually written a little about this in the past, but I especially like the way she draws attention to the importance of the word itself. Many people are quick to say: ""I absolutely believe men and women should be equal, but why call it feminism? Isn't that word exclusive? Why not say humanism (as many people do)?"" Even I've been guilty of wondering the same in the past.I think there are many great arguments for why it should be ""feminism"" and not just ""humanism"", ""black lives matter"" and not just ""all lives matter"", ""gay pride"" and not just ""sexual pride"", but I'll let Adichie do the talking on that issue. She summarizes it marvelously.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store!121!I want to just buy a crate of these and pass them out to strangers and friends and family.!121!This should be required reading!121!I’m tired of feminists picking on the weakest, turning into bullies, using their platform to harm someone who is already vulnerable. At this stage, your feminism is as good as worthless if it doesn’t include trans women. This essay is hailed as an introduction to feminism, but honestly, go pick another book. Don’t build your feminism on hate and ignorance.Find more of my books on Instagram!121!EDIT: Because I have so many people constantly arguing that I'm in the wrong for being concerned about this author's intentions, I did some Googling, and found out that this author publicly supported JKR's anti-trans essay. Adichie also continues (at the time I'm editing this) to stand her ground on her opinion that trans women do not deserve the same support as cis women. If you can read the article I just linked, read this review, and read this essay, and still think Adichie is an inclusive feminist, I don't know how to help you see otherwise.You can also read here about how Adichie demanded that her name be pulled off of Akwaeke Emezi's works after Emezi called her out for her transphobia — this is not an isolated incident.Nobody could be more disappointed or shocked than me.We Should All Be Feminists does a lot of things right. It's a quick, easy read that offers some great insight into the basic gist of why feminism is important.That said, this novella has a lot of problems, with the worst of those being heteronormativity and trans-erasure. Adichie goes to great lengths to completely ignore the mere existence of queer and/or trans individuals, with endless gendered language and assumptions. She revisits the ""women are biologically inferior"" argument many times (which she is essentially in favor of - yikes). She literally even says at one point that she wondered while writing this if women have specific genes to improve their domestic capabilities, like cooking. I've face-palmed so many times in the last twenty minutes.I wish I was exaggerating, but this entire novella left me speechless. I'm genuinely not sure why it's being lauded as some flawless piece of feminist work, when it is riddled with issues from start to finish. I thought I would have a new favorite author, and instead, I'm just pissed off.———twitter | booktok | bookstagram | blog!121!A short, insightful essay about a topic I am incredibly passionate about: feminism. I was practically nodding my head the entire time as so much of what was brought forth hit home. However, I had a few issues with heteronormative and cisnormative language. I don't believe she was being intentionally exclusionary, so I'm interested to read her newest feminist essay in the near future!!121!We Should All Be Feminists is a very short non-fiction book by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie about how all of us should do better to ensure that there is equality of gender. This book hit on some very important topics. Even today, society expects that men and women will conform to gender norms. The author talks about “We teach boys to be afraid of fear, of weakness, of vulnerability.” When was the last time that you saw a male openly crying? For women, they are taught that they need to conform to the rules, raise their hands, to not be angry. The author mentions that women have a double-standard where a female who was recently promoted disciplined someone who forged a timecard. The woman was labeled as aggressive and difficult to work with. The author also mentioned how women make up 52% of the population and yet don’t make up even 50% of the positions of power. The author also mentioned, “Many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender. That many men say, like my friend Louis did, that things might have been bad in the past but everything is fine now.” For additional reading, see White Feminism by Koa Beck and Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-Joo. 2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta!121!A fantastic overview of why we should all DEFINITELY be feminists, and a simplified, easy to understand explanation which is more than necessary in a world where *some* people continue to disregard feminism as man-hating or irrelevant. I definitely think that some points are a little vague and somewhat unsubstantiated, albeit recognising that this is for the sake of being concise and to the point. I'd love for everyone to read this at some point... in a world of Piers Morgans we need more Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies.!121!Without confronting men's sense of entitlement, we cannot understand the resistance to gender equality!121!Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie explains her understanding of feminism in this essay. It is a modified version of her TEDx talk in 2012. She uses simple language in describing complex problems that women are facing in our society today with the help of a few examples from her own life.
What I learned from this book 

1) What is the Chimamanda Adichie’s definition of feminism? 
The meaning of the word feminism, according to the Oxford dictionary, is - 
"" the belief and aim that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men; the struggle to achieve this aim"" 
. The author gives a much more practical definition of it in this book. ""My own definition of a feminist is a man or a woman who says, 'Yes, there's a problem with gender as it is today and we must fix it, we must do better.' All of us, women and men, must do better.""  
2) What is the most common misconception about feminists today in our society? 
The author discusses the problems with people's perception of the word feminism. The most common misconception about feminists is - ""Feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands.""  
3) What is the relationship between feminism and culture? 
This is a very relevant discussion that the author is trying to have in this essay as different cultures see feminism differently.  ""An academic, a Nigerian woman, told me that feminism was not our culture, that feminism was un-African, and I was only calling myself a feminist because I had been influenced by Western books. (Which amused me, because much of my early reading was decidedly unfeminist).Anyway, since feminism was un-African, I decided I would now call myself a Happy African Feminist. Then a dear friend told me that calling myself a feminist meant that I hated men. So I decided I would now be a Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men. At some point I was a Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men And Who Likes To Wear Lip Gloss And High Heels For Herself And Not For Men."" 
 
4) Sexism and feminism. 
Was sexism the reason for the origin of feminism? The author is trying to discuss how sexism and preference for males over females resulted in forming an attitude favorable to the males in our society. She describes it by saying how her teacher selected a male student over her as the most eligible person to become the class monitor in this book. ""But I was female and he was male and he became class monitor. I have never forgotten that incident.If we do something over and over again, it becomes normal. If we see the same thing over and over again, it becomes normal. If only boys are made class monitor, then at some point we will all think, even if unconsciously, that the class monitor has to be a boy. If we keep seeing only men as heads of corporations, it starts to seem 'natural' that only men should be heads of corporations.""  
5) Understanding feminist economics. 
Feminist economics can be defined as the critical study of economics and economies, with a focus on gender-aware and inclusive economic inquiry and policy analysis.In this essay, we can see how people in Nigeria have a preformed notion that the male is the sole breadwinner of the family. ""Louis looked at me, surprised, and asked, 'Why is he thanking me? I didn't give him the money.' Then I saw realization dawn on Louis's face. The man believed that whatever money I had ultimately came from Louis. Because Louis is a man.""  
6) Feminism and social hierarchy. 
Here the author uses the words of Wangari Maathai to tell us the problems of not having women at the best jobs in our society.
 ""The late Kenyan Nobel peace laureate Wangari Maathai put it simply and well when she said, 'The higher you go, the fewer women there are.'""  

7) What is Lilly Ledbetter law? 
This is a law passed on 2009 which gives protection for the workers against pay discrimination. According to this law, discrimination based on age, religion, national origin, race, sex, and disability will ""accrue"" every time the employee receives a paycheck that is deemed discriminatory. ""In the recent US elections, we kept hearing of the Lilly Ledbetter law, and if we go beyond that nicely alliterative name, it was really about this: in the US, a man and a woman are doing the same job, with the same qualifications, and the man is paid more because he is a man.""  
8) How should a restaurant waiter behave to a woman? 
Different cultures behave toward women in different manners. Here the author tells how the waiters in Nigeria avoid women customers while never forgetting to greet the men coming with them. The waiters who should be considering both in an equal manner are causing a lot of pain to the women. ""Each time I walk into a Nigerian restaurant with a man, the waiter greets the man and ignores me. The waiters are products of a society that has taught them that men are more important than women, and I know that they don't intend harm, but it is one thing to know something intellectually and quite another to feel it emotionally. Each time they ignore me, I feel invisible. I feel upset. I want to tell them that I am just as human as the man, just as worthy of acknowledgment. These are little things, but sometimes it is the little things that sting the most.""  
9) What do you mean by a 'woman's touch' to the job? 
Here the author tells us how women are ridiculed for the same work for which the men were praised earlier. People are asking for a 'woman's touch' to the job. This is one of the worst manners to treat a woman. If men are praised for a job, women should be equally praised for the same job. It is the people's problem if they expect something different from a woman and not her's. “One said they had expected that she would bring a ‘woman’s touch’ to her job, but she hadn’t.”  
10) What is the problem when some women are investing their effort in 'being liked'? 
This is another problem women are facing now. It has become complicated for a woman to say a firm no as people will start disliking her. The author says that if women try to become likable in all situations, they will land up in deeper troubles.  ""What struck me – with her and with many other female American friends I have – is how invested they are in being 'liked'. How they have been raised to believe that their being 'likable' is very important and that this 'likable' trait is a specific thing. And that specific thing does not include showing anger or being aggressive or disagreeing too loudly.""  
11) What is the best way to prevent gender discrimination? 
One of the most important reasons for the current gender discrimination is the manner in which they were raised when they were children. If we change how we parent our children, we can easily change the gender discrimination in our society. ""A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: we must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.What if, in raising children, we focus on ability instead of gender? What if we focus on interest instead of gender?”  
12) What is the danger of proving masculinity by material means? 
In some cultures, males are always expected to pay the bills. This pressure to perform and pay the money to prove their masculinity has caused a lot of trouble for the males. The author tells us the importance of changing this habit. ""What if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity and money? What if their attitude was not 'the boy has to pay', but rather, 'whoever has more should pay'? Of course, because of their historical advantage, it is mostly men who will have more today. But if we start raising children differently, then in fifty years, in a hundred years, boys will no longer have the pressure of proving their masculinity by material means.""  
13) Why are some 21st century men feeling emasculated by women? 
Some men can't tolerate the success of women. It is a pity to see them feeling emasculated when they obey the orders of their senior women officer or Boss. ""We say to girls, 'You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful butnot too successful, otherwise you will threaten the man. If you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man, pretend that you are not, especially in public, otherwise you will emasculate him.'What if we decide to simply dispose of that word – and I don't know if there is an English word I dislike more than this – emasculation.""  
14) Why is society giving too much importance to the wedding ring worn by women? 
Here the author tells us why even some unmarried women wear a wedding ring to conferences to get respect from their colleagues. ""The sadness in this is that a wedding ring will indeed automatically make her seem worthy of respect, while not wearing a wedding ring would make her easily dismissible – and this is in a modern workplace.""  
15) What is the ideal age for a woman to get married? 
There is no ideal age for a woman to get married. From a Medical point of view, it is true that the risk of Down syndrome is very high in women who become pregnant after the age of 35. But that doesn't give us any license to order a woman to marry before a certain age. Who gave the license to some useless people to have a judgemental view of women who are not married after a certain age? It is an individual's choice to decide whether to marry and when to marry, and we should learn to respect their personal decision. ""Our society teaches a woman at a certain age who is unmarried to see it as a deep personal failure. While a man at a certain age who is unmarried has not quite come around to making his pick.""  
16) What do you mean by the term good-wife material? 
This is one of the biggest dangers of raising a daughter seeing just her marriage in the future. It is the method of making her likable to the husband and the family she will marry.  ""I know a woman who hates domestic work, but she pretends that she likes it, because she has been taught that to be 'good wife material', she has to be – to use that Nigerian word – homely. And then she got married. And her husband's family began to complain that she had changed. Actually, she had not changed. She just got tired of pretending to be what she was not.""  
17) Why are women doing more cooking in the family compared to men? 
This is one of the biggest problems that almost all families in the world face today. In the earlier hunter-gatherer society, men were the hunter (due to their extra physical strength), and women used to cook food. But it is absurd to continue this practice even now when both men and women have an equal role in the family.“Take cooking, for example. Today, women in general are more likely to do housework than men – cooking and cleaning. But why is that? Is it because women are born with a cooking gene or because over the years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role? I was going to say that perhaps women are born with a cooking gene until I remembered that the majority of famous cooks in the world – who are given the fancy title of 'chef' – are men.""  
18) Why are we using the term feminism instead of humanism or egalitarianism if equality irrespective of gender is our ultimate aim? 
This is the most important question that feminists will have to answer multiple times in their life. The author is replying to it in the best possible manner. Feminism doesn't just mean equality between all genders; it primarily seeks to return to women everything they were denied for generations. This is why it's called feminism and not egalitarianism.
 “ Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in general – but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular problem of gender. It would be a way of pretending that it was not women who have, for centuries, been excluded. It would be a way of denying that the problem of gender targets women. That the problem was not about being human, but specifically about being a female human. For centuries, the world divided human beings into two groups and then proceeded to exclude and oppress one group. It is only fair that the solution to the problem should acknowledge that.”  

My favourite three lines from this book 
 “Some men feel threatened by the idea of feminism. This comes, I think, from the insecurity triggered by how boys are brought up, how their sense of self-worth is diminished if they are not 'naturally' in charge as men""   “We have evolved. But our ideas of gender have not evolved very much.”    “The language of marriage is often a language of ownership, not a language of partnership.”   
What could have been better?
This is the only book I have read in all three formats in my life so far (I read the physical book, ebook, and audiobook versions of it). After multiple readings, I still wondered why the author had not mentioned trans women in this book. I was surprised to find out that the author comes under TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and had previously told a few transphobic comments and supported transphobic people. Studies documenting transgender people's experience of sexual violence indicate shockingly high sexual abuse and assault levels. It is said that more than 50% of them had to go through this experience at least once in their lifetime. It is the author's right to take any stand that she believes in regarding the LGBTQIA2S+ community. I was still sad to see one of the most famous feminists in the world taking a stand like that, especially in this age of inclusion.

 4/5 People will have differing opinions regarding the author's opinion about trans women. Still, I think this is a book that everyone should read at least once in their lifetime.!121!غرد يومًا المغني الكويتي حمود الخضر في تويتر بمقطع وهو يغني أغنية سخيفة تقول كلماتها "" لا لا .. لا نحتاج المال كي نزداد جمالا"" فرددت عليه قائلاً بأنه لولا المال لما استطعنا الاشتراك في خدمة الإنترنت لمشاهدتك وأنت ترتدي نظارة ""ماركة"" وتقود سيارة ""فارهة"" وتغني "" لا نحتاج المال""!ليس من عادتي التعليق على كل ما يستفزني في تويتر ، ولكن أعترف بأن من أكثر الأمور استفزازًا بالنسبة لي هي رؤية خليجي ثري، وأنا لا أتحدث عن حمود الخصر فقط، يقول للآخرين بأن المال ليس شيئًا ضروريًا. قد أتقبل أن تصدر هذه الحكمة من شخص فقير ومعدم جرب الحياة بدون مال، أما أن يأت خليجي يزايد على الآخرين وينظّر لهم حول أسباب السعادة وهو الذي لم يجرب أن ينام يومًا واحدًا وهو جائع فذلك أمر في منتهى الخسة والدناءة.تفاعل الكثيرون مع التغريدة، سلبًا وإيجابًا، رفضًا وموافقة، اختلافًا واتفاقًا، ولكن أحد الأصدقاء ممن لم يعجبه ردي قال لي ""وأنت كذلك لم يعينك الفقراء ممثلاً عنهم لت��دد ما يجب أن يقال أو لا يقال عنهم""استغربت كثيرًا من هذا الرد، فهو يفترض أننا حين نتحدث عن الفقر أننا نتحدث عن أنفسنا وحياتنا !حين يكون المعيار هو فقط "" بما أني بخير فالآخرون لا بد أن يكونوا بخير "" أو ""يهمني فقط ما أحصل عليه وليذهب الآخرون للجحيم"" فإننا ننزل إلى ما دون الحياة البهيمية، لأن البهائم، كما نشاهد في أفلام ناشيونال جيوغرافيك الوثائقية، تهتم بأمر بعضها البعض.أنا بخير ولله الحمد والمنة، ولدي وظيفة وسيارة ومنزل وأسافر كثيرًا إلخ إلخ لكن غيري ـ وهم كثيرون جدا ـ ليسوا كذلك. وإذا كنت عاجزًا عن مساعدتهم فإنني حتمًا لن أسمح لنفسي باعطائهم نصائح حول كيفية تحقيق السعادة بدون مال لأن الشخص المعدم أو حتى غير المعدم، في رأيي، يهمه البحث عن المال لتلبية احتياجاته ومن ثم تأتي السعادة وغيرها من الأمور بشكل تلقائي.بدأت مؤخرًا بمتابعة بعض الحسابات النسوية في تويتر، وقد لفت نظري كيف أن الكثير من النساء يستخدمن ذات الحجة التي استخدمها صديقي للرد على مطالب النسويات بوقف الاضطهاد ضد المرأة، أيا كان هذا الاضطهاد ودرجته، فإذا ما غردت نسوية قائلة بأن عائلتها منعتها من السفر لاستكمال دراستها مثلاً، ردت عليها امرأة أخرى قائلة بأن والدها لم يمنعها من السفر ولذلك فادعاء النسويات كاذب!أعترف بأني لست مطلعًا بشكل كبير على الحركة النسوية العربية، ولكنني أعرف ومتيقن بأن النساء في جميع الدول العربية يعانين من التمييز ""الجندري"" لكونهن نساء فقط. على الرغم من أن المرأة العربية حققت مكاسب عديدة في الكثير من المجالات إلا أنها حتى الآن لم تأخذ حقوقها، المساوية للرجل، كاملة بحكم سطوة العقلية الذكورية في مجتمعاتنا.هذا الكتاب، الذي كان في الأصل محاضرة ألقتها الكاتبة في أحد مؤتمرات تيدكس، يسلط الضوء على معاناة المرأة في نيجيريا ولو قمنا بتغيير اسم نيجيريا ووضعنا محله اسم أية دولة عربية سنجد بأن وضع المرأة هو هو سواء كانت نيجيرية أو عربية مما يؤكد بأن قضايا المرأة تتشابه بشكل أو بآخر في جميع المجتمعات.في المرة القادمة التي أتعثر فيها بامرأة في تويتر تقول بأن النساء العربيات بخير سأرمي في وجهها هذا الكتاب، تمامًا كما سأطلب من أي خليجي ثري، يدعي بأن المال ليس مهما، أن يمنحني أمواله التي لا يحتاجها.!121!‘my own definition of a feminist is a man or a woman who says, yes, there is a problem with gender as it is today and we must fix it, we must do better. all of us, women and men, must do better.’
this. this. a thousand times this!this essay has never been more relevant, important or necessary. it is a wonderful introduction to feminism and its growing purpose in todays society. however, it is just an introduction, as the brief length only allows for adichie to concisely outline what feminism is and why it is important. but the topic itself is one that could fill tomes. and i have never read a statement that so efficiently and passionately describes the struggle for gender equality.this book is a call to action, one that every human should be willing to answer. ↠ 4.5 stars!121!— Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun.We Should All Be Feminists is a personal, eloquently-argued essay – adapted from the much-viewed Tedx talk of the same name – by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.Which I have, not so coincidentally, watched numerous times— so much so that I have come to learn and preform the speech alongside her.The modified book version of the talk was a very quick and important read that, like the talk, will stay with me for a long time (especially all the beautifully poignant quotes):“He told me that people were saying my novel was feminist, and his advice to me – he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke – was that I should never call myself a feminist, since feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands.So I decided to call myself a Happy Feminist.”“We have evolved. But our ideas of gender have not evolved very much.”“We spend too much time teaching girls to worry about what boys think of them. But the reverse is not the case. We don’t teach boys to care about being likeable. We spend too much time telling girls that they cannot be angry or aggressive or tough, which is bad enough, but then we turn around and either praise or excuse men for the same reasons.”“It is easy to say, ‘But women can just say no to all this.’ But the reality is more difficult, more complex. We are all social beings. We internalize ideas from our socialization.”“The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn’t have the weight of gender expectations.”“I know a woman who has the same degree and same job as her husband. When they get back from work, she does most of the housework, which is true for many marriages, but what struck me was that whenever he changed the baby’s nappy, she said thank you to him. What if she saw it as something normal and natural, that he should help care for his child?”“Some people ask, ‘Why the word feminist? Why not just say you are a believer in human rights, or something like that?’ Because that would be dishonest. Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in general – but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular problem of gender. It would be a way of pretending that it was not women who have, for centuries, been excluded. It would be a way of denying that the problem of gender targets women. That the problem was not about being human, but specifically about being a female human.”Also, I found this slam poem* to be really fitting with the subject.(* I featured it in My Top Ten Slam Poems.)Overall, I was truly impressed with We Should All Be Feminists and hope to read more from the author.*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

People make culture. ”Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun, a book that highly recommend. This essay is based on a TED talk with the same title and it encourages us not to be negatively influenced by the bad reputation the word “feminism“ has built and that we need to educate our children to understand the importance of gender equality. I liked some of the arguments brought forward but I did not have the feeling she said something new or groundbreaking. I suspect that her TED talk was more powerful and I feel that the impact of her words is heightened in speech. I am a feminist. I’ve been a feminist since I was a child and one of the things that made me angry (and still does) is gender expectancy. Since we are little girls we learn that we need to be delicate, girlish, to play with dolls, to like pink (try to find girl toys that are not pink) etc. Girls who have other preferences are called boyish, rebels. I was a girly child but I hated it when my mum other people told me that a girl should/should not do this and that. The same happens when we grow older. We are expected to cook, do house chores, not to eat too much or do anything that will make us a less worthy match. We need to please men, find a husband and procreate. That is meant to be the ultimate goal in the life of a woman, even in a modern society. As Adichie also says, it is not the same thing with men, they are not expected to learn how to please a woman.„We teach females that in relationships, compromise is what a woman is more likely to do. ”I know things are improving but there still is a long way to go. I saw some articles the other day about Amal Clooney’s speech at UN where she requested for ISIS to be held responsible for the crimes they committed. Can you guess what the titles of the story were? Amal shows her baby bump at the ONU speech!! Seriously, that was the most important thing to tell about her presence there? Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful that she has a little human growing inside her but I do not think it was the case to talk about that in those circumstances. That reminds me of a different problem that I face at work sometimes. During business trips I meet mainly with men and I sometimes worry what should I wear. Should I wear a dress, as I usually like to, or should I wear pants in order to be taken more seriously? Adichie touched this subject as well in her essay, discussing one lecture where she decided to dress uncomfortably and out of character in order to be respected.""The sad truth of the matter is that when it comes to appearance, we start off with men as the standard, as the norm. Many of us think that the less feminine a woman appears, the more likely she is to be taken seriously. A man going to a business meeting doesn’t wonder about being taken seriously based on what he is wearing—but a woman does.""I think people still consider that in order to be successful person (man or woman) one needs to be tough, manly and it angers me. Not everybody is like this and it should not be an aspiration. Each of us, men or women, have our wonderful qualities, we need to cherish them and be ourselves. The pressure that you can only achieve success by being ""manly"" also affects men who need to live to the expectations. I liked that Adichie also discusses the expectations society has for men and that they can also be harmful. ""Gender matters everywhere in the world. And I would like today to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world. A fairer world. A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: We must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.""!121!A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me if I was worried that men would be intimidated by me. I was not worried at all - it had not even occurred to me to be worried, because a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in.this is the second book i have read from my quarterly literary fiction box from pagehabit:this is very much like Between the World and Me in the sense that they are both short works addressing huge issues (race, gender) and approaching them more or less anecdotally, which is a really refreshing approach. i liked this one more than i liked coates' book, which i never even reviewed because i am the worst. (nor have i yet reviewed many of my teeny tiny nonfiction reads from the past year: Consider the Oyster, The Face: Cartography of the Void, The Clothing of Books) but i'm reviewing this one! even though i don't have much in the way of response/content. i love the way adichie writes - this book is conversational and relaxed, there's good flow between her examples and arguments, and her suggestions about how to adjust the way we think about gender and to address inequality are small and manageable, but it's precisely those small, everyday situations where examples set by individuals have an impact on the way the world works, the way we treat other people, the influence on the following generation. 'be the change you wish to see in the world' and all. or, in my own philosophy, 'try not to be an asshole today.' small acts, but big goals:What is the point of culture? Culture functions ultimately to ensure the preservation and continuity of a people…Culture does not make people. People make culture. If it is true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we can and must make it our culture.a lot of adichie's examples are specific to nigeria - i've never heard of a woman being asked to produce her key in a hotel lobby to ensure she was not a prostitute, and waitstaff in america tend to be, if anything, more attentive to women than to men, but many of her observations do have parallels/relevance to gender issues in my land. in any event, she's a hell of a writer and you should probably read this and see what you can do about making the world a little less obnoxious. 'cuz we could use that right about now.come to my blog!!121!Reading this brilliant and important work reminded me of many other books that could positively change society, such ashttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... and many others that should be especially given to young boys and men to form a good alternative to the consumerism mainstream trash we celebrate as culture and part of Western identity today. It´s often the case that 52 pages of condensed intelligence have more solutions, ideas, and concrete plans to fight grievances than unrealistic, over the top, counterproductive, conservative, camouflaged racist, homophobic, misogynic, etc., so called government plans and concepts, all pathetic displays of the many different stages of outdated societal, democratic, government, and economic models, depending on the country, but omnipresent in close to all of them.  How authors like her show the bigotry and madness of our system is amazing, talking about topics Western media likes to ignore, helping to understand the link between stupid neoliberal, neocolonial, neoconservative politics and economics dominating Western democracies, leading to all problems in the Southern hemisphere and directly helping any kind of stone age dictatorship theocracy to stay established as long as possible. Because the companies controlling any aspect of the US and EU get better deals with them than with emancipated, stable democracies that aren´t so easy to exploit.  The problem is not just the direct violence, conditions close to slavery, and oppression women have to deal with in many countries promoting such policies, it´s the poverty and global lack of distributive justice that makes the difference between the best places to live, the Northern European countries following the Nordic model with ecosocial Keynesian models and failing states. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_... Because white, rich men (sorry for being so stereotypical and discriminating this poor group) want to get richer, just some emancipated women, a tiny fraction of the world's population (when looking at child abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse, etc. in so called enlightened democracies and the states incompetence to help the victims, punish the perpetrators, or change the oldfashioned education systems to something not producing offenders and rapist, that can be sure to get no real punishment when grown up and active) can live a peaceful life in one country while the other states are closer to medieval times than to the 21st century or, in some cases, if the state is rich but an authoritarian theocracy, a bizarre mixture of modern technology and tribe culture. I find it highly irritating that many don´t seem to understand that the conditions described in the astonishing novel and series The handmaid's tale and similar Sci-Fi and horror dystopian uchronia works is reality for the majority of the female world population. That the nightmare is just ending for those privileged to just having to push the button to stop watching or to stop reading and never have to face being dominated deluded humans.  It´s not just the God Pan and humans closeness and relationship to nature that were killed with institutionalized stupidity thousands of years ago, it was the destruction of a sustainable and fair matriarchy necessary to facilitate the patriarchic reign of terror that let to all the political and economic madnesses called human history, not to talk of total destruction of nature. One of the quickest ways might be to go the way of activism, alternative political parties, online activism,… in the Western countries to get a fundamental change to a progressive post scarcity political model started to force the dictatorships to change their societal model.  It´s not impossible, clever minds already made all the concepts, they are still just unwanted by the elite, because one of the nastiest elements of the Nordic model is a fair tax system and transparent government making large scale corruption and lobbyism tricky to impossible. Absolutely unthinkable, as these are the only things that could shock those people, not worldwide suffering, just losing cash.Of course, there are still enough problems in the emancipated countries, as progress takes its time to accelerate, and there are many grievances and problems to solve, but all of this is nothing compared to the real suffering and it´s a privilege to be allowed talking about feminism without the fear of stoning, acid attacks, or lynch mobs.Something that often seems to be forgotten in tradition of First world problems is that it aren´t unsolvable errors intrinsic to the system and insolvable without a radical change, but corrections mainly to solve by breeding the next generation of emancipated men, as the old and young sexists, machos, and chauvinists won´t change, no matter what country. That´s what they sadly have in common with all other extremist mindsets with very improbable chances of recovering, as the once infected and indoctrinated mind tends to see the madness as a crucial part of its identity and the personality constructed out of rotten components.

Where I grew up, women did the housework, took care of children, made sure dinner was served, and cleaned up afterwards. Women worked, but only if it did not interfere with the ""career"" of their husbands, and they worked for lower salaries, and were reminded of that fact - often. If the ""Career"" required moving, women resigned from their jobs, packed up and left with the family. Women listened to the stories of men, and deferred to their ""knowledge"", they accepted the myth that men knew about finances while they were just ""spending"" money (quite necessarily, as their husbands couldn't be bothered with the lower chores of grocery shopping and supplying children with clothes, shoes and school materials). Women were likeable, nice-looking, and kind - in public. Under no circumstances did women have political opinions that didn't match their husbands' or challenge their ""intellectual superiority"" openly. They did not challenge the husbands' right to sit and chat over a bottle of wine while they cleaned the kitchen and put the children to bed. They raised their sons to become bosses and their daughters to have a decent education and a day job that could be managed while running a household. Duktig flicka! I don't know how to translate the Swedish phrase, meaning something to the effect that a girl has to be good, hardworking, modest, restrained, likeable, quiet ... anything but a trouble maker or independent intellectual thinker.Where I grew up, in liberal Northern Europe, in the 1980s and 1990s, it was common to think that ""feminist"" is a swearword, something that indicates an angry, ugly, old hag who ""didn't get a husband"", a person who had by definition ""failed"" and vented her frustration at her own failure by making life uncomfortable for ""successful"" people - all out of jealousy. If you read interviews with some of the older members of the Swedish Academy, you will see the kind of male entitlement I refer to. Breaking down the longstanding wall of privilege is painful to them, so they scream. Not Witch Hunt, but: ""Feminist!""Where I grew up, it was common for men to be frustrated when they didn't get to talk nonstop. Each ""interruption"" by a woman would be silently ""tolerated"" or challenged.Where I live now, in the same country, but in a completely different social environment, we try to do what Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie brilliantly suggests: we try to raise our children to be equals. We try to change the language we use when addressing boys and girls, we try to disrupt the tradition of expecting different things from female and male staff, we try to see human beings with individual needs and interests rather than ""hard men"" and ""kind women"".But there is a trend again in the world, and the author of this short essay points it out in the clearest possible way: feminism has again become a negative, something that is thrown in as an insult whenever someone wants to silence a woman who breaks the hidden rule of behaviour, which tells her that her anger is ""aggressive"", while her male counterpart is ""assertive and strong"".We must talk about gender again! And we can't let it be watered down to general ""human rights"" or ""humanism"", for there is a gender problem which can only be solved if we acknowledge the fact that it exists. The author uses the example of a black man who tells her not to talk about ""feminism"", but rather about ""humanism"", as poor and underprivileged men suffer as well, and so on and so on. The list of ""Whataboutisms"" is long. That is true, but it doesn't address the problem. My broken leg is not mended by pointing out that my neighbour has a bump on his forehead. The black man had no difficulties talking about his disadvantage as a coloured man, and didn't see that by his own reasoning regarding feminism, the question of racism must by analogy also be watered down to a general fight for ""human rights"". It is not that easy though - there are problems that relate directly to the notion of white supremacy, and they have to be addressed specifically. And there are problems around gender that have to be honestly treated for what they are.So I agree with the author that we should all be feminists. We should be the kind of feminist we choose ourselves, and I am quite close to her individual definition of herself as a Happy Feminist Who Doesn't Hate Men And Who Likes To Wear Nice Clothes For Herself. Feminism is about setting the record straight. And to do that, educators and parents need to be aware of the messages we send to the next generation. The adjectives we use DO matter. This essay is a brilliant discussion starter on the topic!Read it!Postscript:And in case anyone doubts we still have a lopsided society, check out today's article in the Guardian regarding ""women having to quit their jobs to fill the gaps in care taking"". I think it is about time that we sign up Johnson, Farage, Trump, Putin and all those other ""strong"" men to do some care taking. After all, it requires some muscle, and men are physically stronger than women, I have been told?https://www.theguardian.com/society/2...Postscript 2:I am thinking of creating a ""misogyny of the day"" file. Each day, all over the world, we read reports like the following one from Japan, reporting that a school faked test results for decades to make sure more men than women become doctors. The women who would have passed would come in handy in the post Brexit care taking crisis - working for free? But then of course, they would be unwelcome foreigners in UK. Difficult to be racist and misogynist and in need of care.https://www.theguardian.com/world/201...!121!'Culture does not make people. People make culture. If it is true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we can and must make it our culture.I read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's We Should All Be Feminists in a single, uninterrupted sitting over two beers at my favourite bar. This is important for two reasons. First, it shows how quickly one is able to read this book, and read it you should. This should be, assuredly, essential reading. At it's worst it is simply a primer and general basis for examining feminism but even those who have spent a great deal of time studying and living it will find great value in her words. She is powerfully succinct and delivers her message in potent anecdotes easily swallowed in a coating of gorgeous prose than leaves one yearning for more (after finishing this I spent a few months reading everything she had written). Yes, this is just a printed version of her readily and freely accessible TED talk yet it elaborates on a few points and being able to connect with the printed word and drink in her message this way is an extraordinary experience. Secondly, and more importantly, the fact that I was able to read this uninterrupted in a bar is an interestingly gendered privilege that those who disagree that gender plays to extremely biases and unequal treatment should pay attention to. And it is exactly that, a privilege, and because I was able to enjoy my solitude while reading in a crowded bar I need to speak up. Imagine, for a moment, had I been female and alone. Without a doubt, a male figure would have inquired what I was reading and probably would have probed me to talk about it. Or, let's face it, more likely would have not given a damn about what I was reading but used it as a spring board to talk about what he reads and why it makes him so cool. Probably would have tried to get me to drink a bit more. Probably would have ignored that I was sitting there alone trying to read a book and been completely oblivious that his presence was a total, undesired interruption. Knowing myself, I would have been polite and chatted while glancing back at my book each moment the conversation lagged hoping to continue reading. I've seen this happen countless times. A girl alone and enjoying a drink is never left alone. Men swarm like flies. She probably just got off work or is waiting for something. She is assuredly not there for you. She is there for her. Let her be. There is a very good chance I would never have made it more than a dozen pages through this book trying to read it alone and drinking in a bar had I been female. And this is very problematic.What is it with males who cat-call? Why does it seem that this sort of behavior happens most often when someone is engrossed in their own life, ie. looking at their phone, listening to music or reading a book (also, why is it that so many people see reading a book--and this goes for all genders--as an open invitation to keep talking? I read in my car on lunch breaks for this very reason). It seems to be some creepy ego trip--how dare she have a life that I have no part of they must think. Whats worst are those who see a ring and proceed anyway like some gross primal alpha male domination instinct. It's repulsive and juvenile. The girl you see on the subway or in the bar or at a park or wherever you may be isn't there for you. She isn't wearing a dress to impress you, she just likes that dress. Her make-up wasn't put on that morning to please you. She smiles at you when you say something because that is what polite people do, not an invitation to the bedroom. Please stop this behavior.'People make culture' Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says, 'If we do something over and over, it becomes normal. If we see the same thing over and over, it becomes normal.' This sort of animalistic male domineering has gone on for so long that it has become a norm. People talk about creepers in clubs and bars as if it is just an annoyance that comes with the territory instead of a problem that should be addressed, which is very sad to me. Yes, this is not something I have to deal with so I am most definitely speaking out of place and likely offensive to some because of this and I am sorry, but I just am tired to seeing misogynists get away with being creepy assholes because it is just 'something that happens'. This male behavior seeps into all of society and sexualizes everything. Recently I encountered a man with a t-shirt listing 'Rules for Dating My Daughter'. If you are a man and own a t-shirt that discusses your own daughter's sexuality, that isn't cute it is repulsive. Why are you sexualizing your own daughter? Why must we impose sexuality onto anything? 'The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are.' This sort of sexualization in society takes hold in so many ways. Clothing is assessed for how others will respond to it sexually, our speech, our actions, the way we move when passing a stranger on a street, hell even the books we read the shows we watch the hobbies we have all get looked at by society in a way that people assess in a sexualized manner. Girls that like sports or video games are 'hot', girls that read Jane Austen are 'nerds', knitting isn't sexy, etc, et al, and all of it is bullshit. Let people be people and treat them like people. It makes me sad hearing from female friends how many strangers on social media start a conversation with 'hey sexy' or something to that effect. A woman is not her looks, please at least acknowledge she has a brain and a personality first. Do these lines actually work? 
We teach girls shame. “Close your legs. Cover yourself.” We make them feel as though being born female they’re already guilty of something. And so, girls grow up to be women who cannot say they have desire. They grow up to be women who silence themselves. They grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think. And they grow up — and this is the worst thing we do to girls — they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form.
It is sad to think these are the lessons learned from common interaction with society. 'This is how to start: We must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.' What is most important from Adichie's words though is that Feminism isn't just something for 'angry women', but something for everyone. 'My own definition is a feminist is a man or a woman who says, yes, there’s a problem with gender as it is today and we must fix it, we must do better. All of us, women and men, must do better.' This is something we all must take to heart. It isn't just about empowering females, but also about teaching males about their own behavior. Male fragility is a real thing and forcing men to submit to gender normative restraints is just as damning as imposing it on females. 'But by far the worst thing we do to males—by making them feel they have to be hard—is that we leave them with very fragile egos. The harder a man feels compelled to be, the weaker his ego is.' Boys tease other boy who cry or might like something that is seen as 'girly'. They force an obdurate normality that becomes like a cancer and the side-effects harm everyone. Much misogyny can be boiled down to a male feeling they must assert a dominance or because they feel threatened. We must teach boys that a self reliant woman isn't a threat but something to be cherished just as much as we should teach girls that being independent and strong isn't something to shrink away from.
And then we do a much greater disservice to girls, because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of males. We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls: You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful but not too successful, otherwise you will threaten the man. If you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man, pretend that you are not, especially in public, otherwise you will emasculate him
I find that the concept of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl to be one of the most damning motifs we find in entertainment art forms. This whole idea that a man can tame some wild girl and save her from herself is disturbing. Why can't we have the Well Adjusted and Well Read Dream Girl? The Independent and Business Minded Dream Girl? Another motif in entertainment is that white (male) knight that is the only thing that can save the girl (look at 13 Reasons Why, which is hugely problematic on countless other levels as well, but perpetuated the idea that all of society fails this girl and only the white male love interest can save her but just happens to be too late. Bleh.). We need to teach our children to be strong, to be kind, to be themselves and to see that gender norms are damaging to both themselves and others.'Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. I am angry. We should all be angry. Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change. But I am also hopeful, because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to remake themselves for the better.'Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a fantastic speaker and writer that can deliver a heady and multi-faceted topic in such easily accessible ways without sacrificing the weight and magnitude of the ideas. This is a book everyone should read and give thought to. This is a problem that affects us all regardless of our gender and the issues of it should always be first and foremost in our minds and actions if we ever hope to see a change in the world. Treat others like people, with love and not lust, with hope and not hindrance. Let the girl at the bar reading by herself read her book and give her the agency to talk to you if she chooses to, and if she doesn't, don't take it as a slight against yourself. We are all trying to get through this life, lets do it together. I'd like to publicly declare misogyny as my arch-enemy, please join me in the fight to exterminate it. Let education and empathy be our weapons, and always lead by good example.5/5'Some people ask: “Why the word feminist? Why not just say you are a believer in human rights, or something like that?” Because that would be dishonest. Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in general—but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular problem of gender. It would be a way of pretending that it was not women who have, for centuries, been excluded. It would be a way of denying that the problem of gender targets women.'!121!Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has a presence about her that is stunning!!!!She is eloquent- lovely - warm - and real! It's natural to immediately love this woman the first time you see her, and listen to her speak. That said....she is magnificent in her TED TALK -- from which this small pocket size book was then put together. When I read this book - I didn't have nearly the same feeling about it as when I listened to Chimamanda speak. In fact - I actually debated a few things ( my own voice took off with a mind of its own).... For example: She asks, ""why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage, yet we don't teach boys to do the same""? When I listen to her speak in her Ted talk about this, it felt right ---she was speaking from her experience coming from Africa.When I read this book - taken at face value- here in America - ( in the Bay Area 2017), I asked myself... did I do this? The answer is no! Neither of my daughters are married - nor do either have children. They are 31 and 35 years of age. My friends have transformed years ago too!!!Also.... my husband was raised by a single mother - he was not taught specific male stereotype gender roles. He was not raised with a dis -service. I guess what I'm saying -- is I'm happy to see a few of the issues that were challenged in here -- have transformed. It might be nice to acknowledge the growth. What makes this book special is CHIMAMANDA!!!!! That's it!!! She's GREAT!!!! Of the two - I'd pass on this pocket book - and instead listen to her speak this book on her TED TALK......a FEW TIMES!!! And mostly.... the overall message is a given! Thumbs Up! Amen!!! Many thanks.... this book was a 'gift' sent to me in a lovely box - with a few books - toys and Tea cup .... ( very kind... very cute - quality books), from The Quarterly Literary Box. 'Surprise Book Treats'.... what will the book world think of next? Very cute and creative - as I said! Thank you for this lovely gift. Love the 'Jane Eyre' black tea! :)!121!This reiterated many of my own beliefs but in such a concise and well developed argument. I'd highly recommend this to anyone curious about feminism and gender studies because it's the perfect intro.!121!Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.We Should All Be Feminists tackles the issue of feminism in the twenty-first century, rallies readers to envision a better, more equal world, and then encourages readers to take action to make that vision a reality. The misunderstanding and negative stigma associated with the word feminist is eloquently explained in just a few short pages. The clear-headed, concise approach taken by the author to make the word and the cause more accessible to all is effective. But it shows how that word feminist is so heavy with baggage, negative baggage: you hate men, you hate bras, you hate African culture, you think women should always be in charge, you don't wear make-up, you don't shave, you're always angry, you don't have a sense of humor, you don't use deodorant. Rather than be afraid of the word feminist, readers are encouraged to understand and embrace it. Much care is given to examining the varied ways in which boys and girls are raised, highlighting the disparate priorities emphasized in their upbringing based solely on their gender. We spend too much time teaching girls to worry about what boys think of them. But the reverse is not the case. We raise our girls to see each other as competition - not for jobs or accomplishments, which in my opinion can be a good thing, but for the attention of men. We do a great disservice to the boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of our boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. [. . .] But by far the worse thing we do to males - by making them feel they have to be hard - is that we leave them with very fragile egos. Citing the norms society has come to accept, and the sexual politics that continue to cause imbalance between genders, the author urges readers to transform their way of thinking and lay the foundation for more equality in future by examining and reforming the way boys and girls are raised. Gender matters everywhere in the world. And I would like today to ask that we should begin to dream about a plan for a different world. A fairer world. A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how we must start: we must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently. Personal stories are interwoven throughout, giving a more intimate feel to this essay, which was adapted from a TEDx talk given by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in 2013. We Should All Be Feminists is a small book overflowing with big messages. -My deepest gratitude to Quarterly.co for providing a free Literary Box with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Quarterly.co's Literary Box comes with bookish goodies, a feature book, and two additional books selected by the author of the feature novel. 

What makes the Literary Box special are the notes written by the author of the feature book. These notes give readers unique insights into the book that only the author would know.!121!Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a leading voice in African literature today. She has written three novels and one short story collection that have all won multiple awards. Two years ago she was asked by organizers of the TEDx talk to deliver a lecture on her views on feminism in the 21st century. We Should All Be Feminists is the published essay of her talk, and is a resource that is beneficial to all who read it. After reading Americanah, I was curious to read one of Adichie's novels that takes place fully in Africa in order to find out more about its culture. In this slim volume, Adichie expresses her views about women's place in Nigerian society. In her Igbo culture, for example, women can not make family decisions, which to her is baffling because she is the only one in her family who is interested in genealogy. In the metropolis of Lagos, women can not go to bars alone, they are viewed a certain way if they go into hotels, and single woman actually wear wedding bands to business meetings. The division of the sexes is clear, and even today women are considered a failure if they do not get married. Adichie stresses that human nature has not advanced in over one thousand years. Then people were valued for their physical strength so of course men were considered superior beings. Today people are valued for their wisdom and intellect and women comprise 52% of the population, yet men are still ahead. This, she stresses, is because in many cultures, men are considered the breadwinners and woman the domestic workers even if the woman has a higher level of education and a job paying more money than her male counterpart. Adichie believes that in order for women to make strides in Nigerian or any society that people have to view women from a similiar lens as men, or the divisions in society will remain rigid. Sharing an episode from her schooling, Adichie reminded me of an instance in my own school experience even though we grew up in different countries. In middle school her teacher told their class that the student with the highest test grade would become class monitor. She got the highest grade but a boy became class monitor. Meanwhile in my upbringing I always did better than the boys in my class in our teacher's weekly sports poll. The boys questioned why I won. Unlike Adichie, I got to keep my prize but at a cost of being teased for being better than the boys. In a society that stresses wisdom over brawniness, these two instances would be outliers rather than the norm. As we move further into the 21st century, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie urges everyone to be a feminist in a positive viewpoint. Feminism does not have to mean that a person hates men, isn't happy, or does not show her girly side. Rather feminist should mean that a person strives for women to have equal access to gains in all facets of society that men have enjoyed for centuries. Only 52 short pages in length, We Should All Be Feminists can be read in under half an hour. It is a wonderful manifesto for the 21st century, and is highly recommended. 4 shining stars, downgraded simply for its short length.!121!""La cultura non fa le persone. Sono le persone che fanno la cultura. Se è vero che la piena umanità delle donne non fa parte della nostra cultura, allora possiamo e dobbiamo far sì che lo diventi""!121!""Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.""  This is a small but insightful book. It's quite natural to feel overwhelmed by the concept of feminism and everything it entails. Reading is one of the finest ways for a patient novice on the route to knowing feminism, given how the Internet is a volcano of information (both legitimate and inauthentic). The book can be utilised to learn about feminism as a beginning point. The aspects discussed in the book are:1.  The stereotypical idea of feminism.2.  The word feminist3.  The process of normalisation4.  Invisibilization5.  Pay gap6.  Raising girls and boys differently7. Culture and genderIt's a fantastic little read that I wish everyone was required to read. Grab your copy here or here.!121!⭐The only book on FEMINISM we all need to read once...and every other day👍This book does not preach.This is one of the best reads which tell everything you need to understand about feminism with the most amazing examples from the author's personal experiences👍This book is so aptly short and tells you exactly what feminism means. There's nothing to go beyond this book for me to understand about feminism.It's just as accurate as it gets. Just read this book. It's enough.!121!The fact that feminism is often considered as a negative concept is rather new to me, simply because I've internalized my anger/my annoyance for years and started to point what shocked me to people only recently. Why is that? Did my family raise me in the belief that we women shouldn't speak up? Hardly. Not once did my parents implied that I shouldn't be ambitious because I was a woman. Every day of my teenage years my mother repeated to me that I should never do something - including sex - that I didn't want to do to fulfill other's expectations and for that, I'm grateful. I am a thirty years old woman who's successful in her work, has been in a fulfilling and loving relationship for 6 years and we don't intend to have children just quite yet. My family is okay with that and never implied that I should start a family because that's what people do.So, why? What can explain that until a few years ago I used to not stand up when faced to situations where my being was judged by gendered standards? I could say that I don't know, but it wouldn't be true : I genuinely think we are the products of our society and that I had internalized so many biased statements about what I can do as a woman and what I can't that I didn't even notice them anymore. This is why I find this kind of books important.Short and highly readable but powerful and yes, needed. Because I'll always remember the first time I expressed out loud my anger and bewilderment about a sexist situation : people (including women) told me exactly what the author has been told : ""ugh but you're a feminist"". And yes, feminist was quite the insult here. So I started reading books. Researching. Noticing more and more generally admitted stereotypes in my everyday life. Now, when I hear someone saying things like (last week in an official meeting), ""children can stay here if their mum is busy or their father is at work"", I frown and speak up. I'm annoying, but the fact is, I don't fucking care if I am.
""Anger, the tone said, is particularly not good for a woman. If you are a woman, you are not supposed to express anger, because it is threatening.""
I'll add : because if you're angry people say that you're ""making a scene"", and god forbid you answer when you're insulted! Earlier last week my little sister was publicly insulted in broad daylight because she was wearing a dress. She called me, baffled to see that nobody reacted and that people told her to calm down because ""it was how things were"" when she answered angrily in a situation where she had every right to be mad. Don't tell me it's not true that we women are supposed to be kind and pleasant : it stays, in 2015, how most people think, and you're quickly called a - sexually frustrated - bitch when you dare to say that no, thank you, I don't want to be insulted for no reasons. 
""We teach females that in relationships, compromise is what a woman is more likely to do.We raise girls to see each other as competitors - not for jobs or accomplishments, which in my opinion can be a good thing, but for the attention of men.""
As a teacher, I can't agree more with the author's statement about how we raise children. If I'm sure that many of you are progressive in that subject, it remains that wrong ideas about what are - and more often than not in people's heads, must be - masculinity and feminity are spread every day and I see it in my pupils' behavior on a daily basis. These stupid expectations hurt both men and women.
""What if, in raising children, we focus on ability instead of gender? What if we focus on interest instead of gender?""
That's why I urge you to read this short essay and I'm going to shove this book in my friends' throat gently and nicely advice my friends to read it. If it can make people more interested in these issues, it would already be a positive step. For more of my reviews, please visit:!121!I agree with every single thing in this book! I loved this discussion about feminism from a Nigerian woman's perspective, because Western feminism differs completely from what those women experience every day. I can't wait to read Chimamanda's full-length novels! I have yet to get my hands on one!!121!I read this two years and gave it three stars. Today, I'm bumping it down to one. Why? I had issues with the blatant transmisia, queer erasure, and heteronormative language when I first read it that I shouldn't have ignored. I thought it was a decent enough introduction to feminism, but I no longer agree. I mean, what is the point in learning feminism if it isn't intersectional feminism?  Blog • Trigger Warning Database • StoryGraph!121!This book...is amazing.To all anti-feminists or non-feminists: I challenge you to pick this up and find a reason not to love feminism.To all feminists: Read this. We all need some cheering up right now, I'd imagine, and this will give you a little bit of hope.To all men: This involves you, too. Society disservices you with gender expectations as well as women. You are not oppressed, but you are hurt. We would all benefit from a change in our cultural recognition of what gender is.This book stands out from other books about feminism in so many ways: In its brevity; in the power and beauty of its prose; in its discussion of African sexism alongside its existence in the West; in the relatability as well as in the differences.It's a gorgeous little book. I know I will return to it.Bottom line: Read it, read it, read it. No excuses. It's short, it's important, it's lovely.","['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Essays', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Womens', 'Africa']"
I'm Glad My Mom Died (ebook),Jennette McCurdy,4.47,914628,2022,"A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.In I’m Glad My Mom Died , Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly , she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That's not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here's a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you're just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette's mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don't blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author's mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people's experiences aren't like that, and we don't get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that's because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don't try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother's hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It's also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn't care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn't. It's really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women's emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I've noticed lately where I'll pick up a memoir that's supposed to be funny and instead it's just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that. Do read this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus's Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars!121!I’ve known for so long that my relationship with acting is a complicated one. Not dissimilar to my relationship with food and my body.Both of them feel like constant pulling, yearning, begging, fighting. I’m trying desperately to get their approval, their affection, and I never quite seem to. I’m never quite good enough.
I cannot give this less than five stars, but it was horrible to read.This memoir wasn't initially on my radar because I wouldn't know McCurdy if she showed up at my front door. However, in the hours since I've finished this, I've felt compelled to familiarise myself with clips on Youtube. It gives me a chill to think that this bright talented young girl was concealing so much pain.The title is arresting, as it's supposed to be, but it's far more than just clickbait. McCurdy as an adult wrestles with her perception of her childhood and the pedestal she put her mother on. The mother who aggressively pushed her into acting, despite her protestations, then encouraged her anorexia and lied to doctors about it.It is hard, harder perhaps than I can even imagine, to revisit your past and understand that a person you have loved, admired and tried so long to impress has been a toxic presence in your life. 
People seem to assign thin with “good,” heavy with “bad,” and too thin also with “bad.” There’s such a small window of “good.”
As well as this, it's a portrait of the ugly side of child acting. Reading this, I found myself feeling that surely no child can give informed consent to becoming an actor. They are pushed and pulled between adults who fixate on their appearance, who criticise them, build them up and reject them. No wonder former child actors have such a high rate of substance abuse and mental illness.McCurdy's experiences at home and within the industry left her with an unhealthy relationship with food, her body and being a woman, a relationship that she is finally beginning to reckon with after both her mother's death and her own decision to quit acting. Though I did not know her before starting this memoir, this book invited me deep inside her experiences. I now feel an overwhelming desperation for McCurdy to overcome the trauma of her past and find peace.!121!I'm Glad Her Mom Died Too""Why do we romanticize the dead...?Indeed. Why do we?Before this book came out, my knowledge of Jennette McCurdy only extended to random gifs featuring her iCarly character, Sam Puckett. I didn't actually know who she was and what they were from, I just knew they were funny and fit my ""book review"" purposes. Here's an example:When this book dropped, however, I was drawn to the title, the gloriously vintage macabre book cover, and the fact that it was getting rave reviews. I was excited to read this and loved the cover so much that I purchased the hardcover drop instead of waiting for my library hold. I initially started this in early September, but for personal reasons I won't get into, I had to set it down for a bit. I have almost no triggers and can read pretty much anything without being all that affected, but - again - for personal reasons I won't get into, I found the details of Jennette's mother's behavior, narcissism, and emotional manipulation to be extremely triggering. And don't even get me started on the eating disorder triggers. I was also amidst a fairly stressful period in my work life, so I decided to wait until that was over before picking this back up. Fast forward a little over a month and my library audiobook hold was by then available, so I decided to jump back in with that format. Let me just say that I can't recommend the audiobook version of this highly enough. It is obviously read by Jennette McCurdy herself and I think she does a great job of it. I think the dichotomies of Jennette's life and story are very interesting and well explained. She is able to get across very nuanced and contradictory sentiments without sounding like a complete whiner. And that's a really hard thing to accomplish in practice. For example, she is able to outline how, despite understanding how privileged and ""lucky"" she was to be famous and on TV, she loathed acting, a lot of the fans, and the experiences that came with it all. ^See how assholey that's sounds just me saying it? Well, she nails it in the book, I promise you. I also felt very connected to Jennette and had a lot of empathy for her. I grew up in LA County and am VERY familiar with almost every location she references in the LA/Orange County area. I literally drive by the Westminster Mall (which she references being that she grew up in Garden Grove, and which is basically a nonexistent ghost mall now) every day on the freeway on my way to work. Also, I know I said I didn't want to get too woo-woo personal, but I will just say this: I deeply connected to Jennette in terms of understanding the longstanding effects (as a child who doesn't know any better) of being made to feel like you are responsible for the state of mind and emotions of another person - an ADULT person. For years. It steals your childhood, stunts you emotionally, and really takes a long time to work through. Some people should just NOT have children, folks. It's just that simple. I mean, what they say really is true: a lot of people spend their adulthood just trying to get over their childhoods. And that's even true for ""GOOD"" parents. But I digress. I liked how self-aware Jennette is. Or, at least, how self-aware she appeared to be in this book. That said, I also feel like this memoir came a little soon in terms of Jennette's recovery. She's very, very new to being on ""the other side"" of things. Although perhaps this book is a part of that, and so I can't fault her for that. And who am I to judge or criticize. Overall, this book was a great account of a very unique human experience. I will definitely check out any future books or content Jennette puts out in the future. And I'm rooting for her, her recovery, and her happiness.!121!praying that Jennette makes more from this book than Nickelodeon could’ve ever offered with their hush moneyA truly incredible and hard-hitting memoir. Whether you watched Jennette’s shows growing up (like me) or you don’t know her at all, I think this book is a must read. I don’t want to go into too many details, so I’ll just share some of my thoughts:• The writing is easy to read but still poignant. I think Jennette did a great job recounting the events of her life. I especially appreciate how she recounted her childhood; she really nailed writing from the perspective of a naïve child who doesn’t realize how awful her mother is.• I love how truthful Jennette was about her own fuck-ups. She admitted she was very aware of how bitter and rude she had become, and how ungrateful she seemed (obviously, I think she was justified). • I particularly loved the section about Jennette’s time on “Sam & Cat”. It showed how much her addiction, mental illnesses and eating disorders affected her work; how much Nickelodeon mistreated her, especially when compared to Ariana Grande; and how resentful she had grown over the years.• The exploitation of children in the entertainment industry is something that really needs to be discussed. Seeing a child star expose the abuse she suffered in the industry is truly heartbreaking, but extremely important, especially in this day and age, where even more parents are pressuring their children and forcing them to put themselves out there for fame. I wonder if in 10 years we’ll see similar testimonies from kids of family channels who grew up making money for their parents in an even more disgusting way: by having they entire lives documented and posted online for all to see. • Jennette’s friendship with Miranda was so wholesome <3• A bit of a critique: I feel like certain events were skipped and only mentioned later in the timeline (for example: we never see her audition for iCarly, or how filming the 1st episode was, suddenly it was already 3 years into the filming of the show, out of nowhere we find out that she’d been to multiple events and red carpets, she randomly mentions she knows she has OCD and EDs – I guess she learned and came to terms with it off-page…). Obviously, this is a memoir, so the author knows better than me what was important to document, but still, some of these things seemed kind of crucial in my opinion (especially her learning about her disorders).• The main reasons I’m giving it 4 stars is because memoirs are not really my thing, so I ended up not enjoying this as much as the other books I give 5 stars to; and because, as I mentioned, I think some things could’ve been a bit better. But, again, I still loved this book and highly recommend it to everyone!(review written on 24/08/2022)---this title is BRUTAL 💀 i'm so happy for her 😌 can't wait to read it!!(06/04/2022)!121!this is a very candid account on the abuse jennette mccurdy suffered at the hands of her narcissistic mother, and how that merged with her experience as a child actress. i don’t think you need to be familiar with her show, or even know/care about her as a person to glean lots from this book, and i think it's an important text that could even be considered historical, due to her nature as a public figure and the way her story is likely representative of a much larger population of child actors.for those hoping to get a “tea sesh” about the abuse rampant at nickelodeon, you won’t be getting that here, despite it being what the major media outlets are currently fixating on. jennette doesn’t shy away from talking about her experience with sam & cat (she hated it) and her experience with dan schnieder (terrible person, obviously, whom she never refers to by name), and even dedicates a short chapter to ariana grande, but this novel isn’t centered around that in the slightest, and to come into this book only for that would be a disservice to jennette's story.reading about the abuse jennette experienced firsthand is completely heartbreaking. she writes about having an eating disorder, given to her by her mother, and feeling beholden to her mother at all times. from calling her ten times a day to insisting on showering her even as a teenager, this book is full of triggering content, and i would urge those who have experiences abuse to proceed with caution. i think especially with gen z, we haven’t had a ton of actors from disney and nickelodeon speak out specifically about their experiences on set (the $300,000 offer from Nickelodeon jennette turned down may explain that) and how child acting impacted their lives, and it’s a very necessary perspective to hear as the consumers of that media. hearing some of the things jennette said about her stardom were jarring, in that as children we don’t really know what’s going on behind the scenes and mindlessly consume without regard to the actors lives. i also thought it was super interesting to get the perspective of a very self aware child star that didn’t become super successful on screen after their breakout role, and the narrative she builds around /why/ that was.this book was super impactful, and i have no doubt will reach a large audience. mccurdy's writing style is succinct yet impactful, well organized, balanced with seriousness and humor, told in a very blunt tone. i would definitely recommend listening to the book via audiobook which is narrated by her because it adds a whole new layer of tone. this was a tough reading experience, but i really loved the book and would highly recommend to everyone.Thank you to libro.fm/simon & schuster for the free arc!!121!Shall we light it up? A bridge. It’s time.When I was in middle school, my mother told me that my glasses were ugly, that the children would call me Four-Eyes. Interesting Fact: No one has ever called me this but my mother. She taught me a cabbage soup diet and how to put on trash bags and go running to lose weight. At the end of a long day, my mom swung by a fast-food restaurant. She demanded that I go up and see what the operating hours were. Being super introverted, I hesitated. She started screaming, letting off a stream of obscenities.While I was in college in my early 20’s, I stopped by my mother’s apartment for a visit. She walked right by me in the parking lot. She said that I was so fat that I looked pregnant, and she didn’t recognize me.When I was making $6.70 per hour, working part-time at Sears, my mother asked that I purchase a $200 set of pajamas for her. When I explained that I didn’t even have $200 to my name, was she sympathetic? No way. She laid into a guilt trip. Did I love her? Didn’t she do so much for me? What has that to do with I’m Glad My Mom Died? I know firsthand what it is like to live with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder, and Jennette’s mom has the classic symptoms. This book really resonated with me.I’m Glad My Mom Died is an important work. It lets other people know that they aren’t alone, especially if their parents aren’t top 10% parents. Some parents are bottom 10% parents. It has been a long time since I have felt seen. The last book that I felt really conveyed the complexity of a dysfunctional parent-child relationship is The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls. Did I spend years trying to win my mother’s love? Yes. But do I want to be the person that she would love? No. Because I value honesty and intellect. Because I don’t define my self-worth by beauty or popularity.  Having a mother with borderline personality disorder has a profound impact on a child’s development. Here is one study by the National Library of Medicine: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268672/ It’s time we end the silence.Connect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta!121!Immediate 5 star. Especially as a childhood iCarly fan, wow what these kids had to go through. Even though she doesn’t like hugs, I want to give Jennette a hug after finishing this one. You NEED to listen to it on audio!!!!!121!As someone who’s never watched Nickelodeon or anything with this author, I was still highly engrossed in Jennette's story. You can tell she’s more passionate about writing than acting because her writing is of a higher caliber than other celebrity memoirs that were likely ghost-written. She describes events chronologically in such a detailed and engaging way, picking specific memories to demonstrate the dysfunction of her childhood. I appreciated her honesty, dry humor, and even her bitterness and negativity. Her train of thought is very similar to my own mentality (irritability, cynicism, being extremely critical of ourselves, etc) and having that mirrored back from another deeply wounded person was eye-opening. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one who processes life this way... Can we do group therapy together, Jennette?!While I appreciate the level of detail in recalling these events (no easy feat for those dealing with trauma), I would’ve loved to see more reflections of the themes across the book, like her present-day thoughts on her family, Hollywood, child stardom, body image, etc. As well as her learnings from therapy that she’s incorporating moving forward, just to give the rest of us more hope! Regardless, I look forward to seeing her future work and wish her nothing but happiness.!121!Jennette McCurdy is extremely talented in her writing and i hope she writes more in the future (whatever genre idc, i’ll read anything) because this book alone was a literary masterpiece.it’s very fast pace. i appreciated how Jennette didn’t go into a ton of detail regarding certain subjects. it was just “yup this is was it is, this is how it is, and this is what i’m doing about it” it was very raw and real in my opinion. no flowery language one thing i’ve seen a lot of people say about this book is “wow she’s so funny, her humor is great, ect.” which i don’t entirely understand since everything Jennette went through and described in this book was devastating. from the multiple forms of abuse, eating disorders, and having to grow up too fast….um where is the humor in that?! i did listen to the audiobook with this (which jennette also narrated) and there’s points in which you hear her actually crying.nonetheless, i’m glad to see Jennette thriving in her writing career which she always wanted. i wish her nothing but the best for her.!121!I feel weird giving someone's personal experience a rating so I'm leaving this un-rated, but please know that this was really something incredible. I absolutely recommend checking this one out if you're at all familiar with Jennette, but please do tread with caution if you're sensitive to discussions of eating disorders as this revolves pretty heavily around her struggles with disordered eating and bulimia. CW: child abuse, narcissistic parents, disordered eating, fatphobia, terminal illness (breast cancer), hoarding, use of r-slur, depictions of ocd, depictions of bulimia/purging, gaslighting, emotional manipulation!121!Jennette McCurdy writes a hard-hitting and propulsive memoir. I knew I’d be reading this the moment I came across the ballsy title/cover a few months ago, and am happy to report it did not disappoint. Well worth it if you grew up watching her on TV, or if you want to have a long think about the exploitation of child actors in Hollywood.!121!I’m glad her mom died too.!121!really really hard to read but really insightful and well written. audiobook was particularly great.!121!more child celebrities should write books methinks!121!for the record, i'm glad her mom died too!121!the hype is right.this is what everyone says it is: an excellent debut, a memoir that doesn't pull punches, honest, clear-eyed, and well-written.am i glad i read it? no. this is a grueling read that i picked up based on just how often i heard it spoken of, a level of public discussion i have to assume had to do with the guilty thrill of finding out horrible secrets about people whose faces we see every day. but that's what celebrity memoir is all about. secrets sell and it certainly isn't the author's fault that that's started rubbing me the wrong way.bottom line: an excellent example of a genre i'm going to try to steer clear of.!121!i am going to read the shit out of this book!121!Whoever said this was: impressively funny???? Was tripping on the cleanest weed out there.  I think this is an important book. I love that she was brave enough to write about her life as a child actress, to write about her narcissistic and abusive mother. This auto biography is intense, well written and unbelievably raw.  But it still is a book about a girl who was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her own mother. Please, keep that in mind before you pick this up.  The title might be silly, but there isn’t a single drop of humor here. This is the most depressing thing I’ve ever read.  Again, I am glad it exists. I am so proud of this girl for being brave enough to put all of this out in the world. I am sure this will help other people who have been through the same.  I just don’t think this was properly advertised. This is one of the most intense, gut wrenching and uncomfortable stories you’ll ever read. So make sure you’re ok mentally before you go through it.!121!I really appreciated Jeannette’s writing style in this book. She’s very cut and dry and to the point. No flowery language or metaphors. That writing style made it feel really raw, transparent, and honest. And it very much feels like Jeannette’s voice. I would also really recommend the audiobook. It was so incredible to hear her story in her voice. The book starts out in Jeannette’s childhood and then progresses to her acting days and then to her adult life post acting. It was a devastating yet eye opening journey to see her come to terms with how much her childhood hugely negatively impacted her life and ruined so many healthy habits she should’ve had in her adult life. And to see how the abusive from her mom was a huge huge part of that. Would highly recommend as long as you check the trigger warnings first!!121!THIS DESERVES EVERY OUNCE OF HYPE IT'S BEEN BLESSED WITH!Warning to look up trigger warnings before proceeding. There is a LOT of triggering content in this book. It doesn't shy away from facing problems head on and with an unflinching tone.I adored this book. It is so rare for me to be impacted this deeply.When I tell you I stayed up until 5 am to finish this book because I simply couldn't sleep without knowing Jennette would be okay.I grew up on iCarly. I love Sam. I watched this show with no inkling of an idea of what Jennette was going through. The fact that there are people out there that did know *cough* Dan *cough*, is sickening to me. This isn't JUST a look at how horrifying Hollywood is, especially child stars, but it's also a harrowing depiction of how manipulative love can be. The way a parent's all consuming love for their child can be weaponized and watered to grow into something this vile and life altering is absolute insanity.I truly wish the absolute best for Jennette McCurdy. I know she'll never see this. But my heart goes out to her and everything she has been forced to face. I hope she is awarded every ounce of happiness that a life can possibly offer. She deserves a life of no red lights, no lines, no pauses before 'I love you's. She impacted me so much with her honesty and I can't thank her enough for writing not only a horrifying story but also a damn good book.!121!I was not a huge fan of Nickelodeon, and I watched their shows only once in a while during my childhood. Drake & Josh and iCarly were the two shows I watched. I particularly remember the part where Sam (Jennette McCurdy) talks about reading in iCarly, which became a famous meme. 

 Her acting in iCarly was spot on and funny. Jennette did a brilliant job while acting, which is why people like me who rarely watched the show still remember her.Whenever we hear the name Jennette McCurdy a bubbly, loud, energetic young lady comes to our mind, as her friend Miranda Cosgrove mentions in this book. This book tells us that there were a lot of hardships and sorrow hidden behind those energetic and brilliant performances. 
Seven key ideas from this book 

1) If child labor is unethical, aren't child actors too unethical? 
During December every year, when it is nearer to Christmas, there is something that everyone all over the world (especially in America) will do. It is to rewatch the Home Alone movie. The family dynamics of the McCallister family, ingenious script by John Huges, brilliant direction by Chris Colombus, fantastic music by John Williams, and extraordinary production design and sets will make us relive our childhood. Home Alone is pure nostalgia for many people. Apart from everything mentioned above, the biggest factor that brings us back to rewatch Home Alone is the amazing acting by Macaulay Culkin. I was shocked when I heard that he had to sacrifice his entire childhood to entertain us. He was abused both physically and mentally by his jealous father. The law caught him with marijuana possession. He was arrested for speeding and many other illegal activities. The abuse has affected his mental health, which pushed him into addiction.

Parents using their children as money-making machines by making them actors and making them overwork for different movies when they should be going to school has been a severe issue in the life of many child actors. If we closely observe the career graph of child actors, we can see that only very few become great actors when they grow up. In Jennette's story also, we can see that she was not at all interested in acting. But her mother forced her to act even from the age of six. Nobody even cared to ask her what Jennette liked to do. She tells in this book that she hated acting, which is why she quit acting after her mother died. If child labor is unethical, then child actors are also unethical. Then the million-dollar question of who will do the children's role in the movies will arise. If child actors were not there, how would they have made movies like Harry Potter, where most of the main actors are children? “I HATE ACTING CLASS. Even though it's a chunk of time away from Home, I don't look forward to this class the same way I look forward to church because I find acting even more uncomfortable than being stuck at Home.""  
2) How did the ""Creator"" make Jennette's life miserable? 
This is another big problem child actors face, the predators on the shooting sets. The author mentions a ""creator"" who behaved harshly toward her. This same creator also allegedly misbehaved with some other crew members in a sexually inappropriate way. We have heard about many child stars who were sexually harassed on the shooting sets. Some even make them work overtime, destroying the younger kids' enthusiasm and courage.  I think the only way to prevent child actors from being exploited by parents and crew members is by appointing an internal committee in every shooting set that even has access to mental health care professionals if needed. This committee should ensure that a certain percentage of children's earnings should be solely used for children's personal needs like education. This will prevent the children from being monetarily misused by their parents. It is challenging to implement this as different countries have different rules and procedures. A very few countries have tried to implement a similar method. But they were all disasters due to their lack of planning and coordination. If Hollywood and people in the USA start implementing it perfectly, all the countries may slowly follow it. A similar rule should be implemented for the children on social media (especially a few family channels on youtube.), even though it will be a little bit more complicated to implement in those cases.“Cut!” The Creator yells off camera, his mouth full of something.""“But our wardrobe designer said that The Creator explicitly asked for bikinis, and so she had to at least have me try on one or two of them so he had the option. ”  
3) How are children's life affected by their narcissistic parents? 
Falling into a narcissistic romantic relationship is a harrowing experience. Being the daughter of a narcissistic mother is a much more painful experience. This book shows how her mother totally controlled her daughter's life. The author tells us how proper medical help and therapy after such a long physical and mental abuse helped her recover from such abysmal despair. ""My mother emotionally, physically and mentally abused me in ways that will forever impact me.""""I realize that she's happy and I'm not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.""  
4) Do we need to romanticize the dead? 
This is a tough question to answer. Some say objectivity is born after a person dies. It is true that death changes the light in which we see people. But up to what extent? Can mourning alternate realities? These are a few among the many questions I have asked myself after reading one book some time ago on this topic. The author brings this topic back into the limelight.Some people say it is better to speak about the positive sides of the dead person during the time of grief, but not focus on their negative facets as everybody also has a negative side to their personalities along with the positives. But what will we do if the person only has a negative side and the positive side is almost nil? I think it is better to remain silent than to focus on the negatives during mourning. These are the questions that we should contemplate a lot before answering. The answers to the above questions vary depending on the individual's personality and character.  “Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can't we be honest about them? Especially moms, they're the most romanticized of anyone. ”  
5) Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa 
Both anorexia and bulimia are eating disorders. In anorexia, people restrict their food intake to lose weight. In bulimia, people will eat an excessive amount of food in a short period of time and then purge them using various methods to prevent weight gain. Both these disorders will cause severe health problems. For example in bulimia due to repeated trauma to the esophagus due to vomiting gastric acidic contents, the person can develop esophageal adenocarcinoma. So, this is a serious medical problem that healthcare professionals should treat. ""Jennette, what you're describing is... really unhealthy. Your mother essentially condoned your anorexia, encouraged it. She... taught it to you. That's abuse.""  
6) Friendship. 
Building a good friendship takes a lot of time, effort, and sacrifice. We can see the author talking about friendships in this book. I remember reading about different types of friendship in a book.Friendships can be classified into three. -1) Friendship of pleasure - Friendship ends when the enjoyment and fun end.- 2) Friendship of convenience - Friendship ends when the convenience factor end.- 3) True friendship - Friendship based on mutual respect.The author mentions that she dislikes friendship of convenience. ""I don't like knowing people in the context of things. ""Oh, that's the person I work out with. That's the person I'm in a book club with. That's the person I did that show with."" Because once the context ends, so does the friendship.""  
7) What is the problem with comparing our life with that of successful people? 
In this age of social media, every one of us has a tendency to know more about the life of successful people from their social media profiles and compare our life with theirs. The biggest problem is that people only post the positive side of their lives on social media. So checking others' Instagram profiles and comparing our life to others can push us into anxiety and depression. In Jennette's case, she had Ariana Grande as the co-star in one of the shows, and she developed a habit of comparing her life with Ariane's. This is a habit we should never develop, and the author tells us all the troubles she had to face due to this behavior. ""The third is that Ariana is at the stage in her career where she's popping up on every 30 Under 30 list that exists. And I'm at the stage in my career where my team is excited that I'm the new face of Rebecca Bonbon, a tween clothing line featuring a cat with her tongue sticking out. Sold exclusively at Walmart. And I frequently make the mistake of comparing my career to Ariana's. I can't help it. I'm constantly in the same environment as her, and she doesn't exactly try to hide her successes.""   
My favourite three lines from this book 
 ""Suddenly, I feel just like that little eleven-year-old girl who was confused and scared and uncertain. That eleven-year-old girl who was doubtful that I knew the whole truth of my situation, who was unsure that my mother was the hero she pretended to be, but who shoved that doubt down.""   ""I don't like when grown-ups make faces or sounds that I don't understand. It's frustrating. It makes me feel like I'm missing something.”    ""And the kids who are annoying, don't take direction, ask questions—those are the kids who won't get sent out on auditions. The kids who will get auditions are the ones who shut up and do as they're told.""   
What could have been better?
The title of this book is a brutal one. I think Jennette should have given it a much more positive title. This current title will indeed pull the attention of many new readers to this book. But it also has its demerits. Whenever the author hears or sees the name of this book in the future, the first emotion that will come to her mind might be anger and sadness just because of this title. I can never tell that the author should have forgiven her mother as she had to suffer a lot due to her. But still, I think the title is brutal, and it should have been a different optimistic one.
Rating 
 5/5 This celebrity memoir might be a difficult book, but you should never miss the opportunity to read it.You can also follow me on  Instagram  |  YouTube First Channel  |  YouTube Second Channel  |  Twitter  |  Snapchat  |  facebook  |  TikTok!121!Shit, I'm glad her Mom died too.!121!**Winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoirs!**Chances are, if you have a TikTok or Instagram you know what this book is. I mean, I'm Glad My Mom Died was on back order already the morning it was published and was a sought after title all August and is a book you just cannot avoid if you have an internet connection or local bookstore. Nor should you. Jennette McCurdy, the former iCarly actress, speaks so openly and candidly about a lifelong cycle of abuse and dependency with her mother (who passed in, as the title likely led you to assume), chronicling trauma and serious mental health struggles such as eating disorders that all were brought upon her through the need to serve her mother’s wishes. It’s one I’ve had right in everyone’s faces at the bookstore since we finally got copies, as the title is sure to solicit reactions and I privately enjoy seeing them, but also it is an important look at abuse and recovery. I had to finally read it. I mean we all deserve a Hot Girl Summer but can I truly say I had one if I didn’t read any Colleen Hoover, Beach Read or at least this, the most popular book of the end of summer? No. And I’m glad I did pick this up to read at work because this deserves all the hype and more, and I hope this is another success on McCurdy's road to improved mental health. While she loved her mother, their relationship was often abusive and left a lot to detangle in adulthood. Deeply personal and moving, this is a look into McCurdy's life as well as a necessary warning about the ways young girls are objectified, commodified and exploited, even by those closest to them.‘I realize that she’s happy and I’m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.’That line says it all, honestly. This is an upsetting account of McCurdy's life, and one where all the warning signs were out in the open and ignored. Especially by Nickelodeon who don’t exactly come across well here. We’ve heard horror stories about the treatment of child actors for as long as there have been child actors, though this isn’t simply another case file of grievances but a really heartfelt self-examination and testimony. McCurdy comes across as very open and honest, and it really paints a positive look at her as a person who has gone through so much. There are times when she discusses the anger she felt, which feels justified and as Soraya Chemaly talks about in the book Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, sometimes anger is the appropriate response in order to not be silenced or ignored. It can be an important tool, or an armor as McCurdy describes: ‘I became an angry person with no tolerance for anyone. I'm aware of this shift and yet have no desire to change it. If anything, I want it. It's armor. It's easier to be angry than to feel to pain underneath it.’She also expresses feelings of regret for having lashed out in these times, looking at how abuse shouldn’t just beget another cycle of abuse, and these discussions seem to come from a place of maturity and healing. It is likely very encouraging and empowering for victims of abuse to read much of this book, though heads up, it does get into some very triggering situations and topics.‘Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be.’McCurdy shows how so much of her life was lived to be what her mother wanted, and much of this became painful. She was raised in a Mormon household and was homeschooled by her mother, a mom who wanted to always present a perfect image and often lashed out hurtfully. In short, McCurdy is open about her mom having narcissistic tendencies, and while she is still caring for her mother (she does make it clear she very much loved her mother), the scars are quickly apparent. From years of life like this, McCurdy felt she lacked an authentic self, and this carried over into struggles with body image from seeing one’s own self as an object that serves others instead of something personally only yours. This is a major theme in the essays in My Body by Emily Ratajkowski for those looking for further reading on the subject. When fearing her breasts would grow during puberty, the mother encouraged extreme calorie reduction and dangerous dieting practices. While discussions of the mother bookend this memoir, the bulk of the middle portion is about eating disorders. Most tragic is the moment in the hospital with her siblings saying goodbye to her mother when she says the one thing she thinks could actually make her mother proud of her: ‘I'm in the ICU with my dying mother, and the thing that I'm sure will get her to wake up, is the fact that in the days since mom has been hospitalized, my fear and sadness have morphed into the perfect anorexia motivation cocktail, and finally I have achieved mom's current goal weight for me: 89 pounds.’There is a lot to be said about the ways this reflects a general attitude around young women and girls, especially in the entertainment industry and how it robs them of their own agency. ‘I was conditioned to believe any boundary I wanted was a betrayal of her, so I stayed silent,’ she writes, and in this we see how these systems perpetuate themselves: silence. Young women and girls are broken down to believe they are in service to another (we could get into a long discussion on how this is the social framing inflicted by the intersections of misogyny and capitalism) and silence is induced by making them first feel they wouldn’t be believed or listened to but also that they deserve it, it’s for their own good or that they don’t even have the agency to speak out. It is truly tragic how often victims of abuse are silenced when they do speak out, which is another tool in oppression.So this book is a lot, but it is also very good and seems very healing. I was under the impression based on how it was presented and marketed that this was more of a comedic memoir, so heads up if that was what you assumed as well, but the weight and power of her words as she discusses a lifetime of abuse is definitely worth reading for. It does read very plainly, almost like a “class assignment” type of tone recounting events, though they are certainly difficult memories to have to revisit. I hope McCurdy is doing well, and it is very honorable of her to use her experience to reach out and help others in this way. There could have been more depth to some of it, but this is less a look at the causes and social critiques and more at the personal effects she endured. There are great reminders too about how to move forward and not get bogged down in being perfect, such as when she writes that ‘slips are totally normal. When you have a slip, it’s just that. A slip. It doesn’t define you. It doesn’t make you a failure. The most important thing is that you don’t let that slip become a slide‘. I won’t get too much more into it, as you should probably read the book and this is McCurdy's story to tell, but I am very glad I read this.'My mom didn't get better. But I will.'!121!I’m happy Jennette was able to tell her story and show how terrible it is to have such an abusive mom and what the entertainment industry can do to a child.My rating does not reflect how true and important the telling of her story is.The writing of the story however, was very painful to get through. It could have been edited better with how repetitive it is. It also has no self reflecting within the story, not that she isn’t a victim cuz she is. How she viewed other women and other women friendships also bothered me. I can see how coming from such a competitive career like acting could HAVE caused that but, I would HAVE loved to see some self-reflecting on that part as well.!121!as victoria justice would say: ‘i think we’re ALL glad her mom died’.!121!very powerful and also very funny. this is by far one of the best memoirs I've read!121!you know what jennette? i’m also glad your mom died!!!!!121!Memoirs should be one’s reflection about one’s past, otherwise is just a journaling exercise. This whole book felt juvenile, repetitive and under-edited. The dialogues were weird and unbelievable because they totally lacked context (and before someone misinterprets my words, I am not saying that I don’t believe Jennette words, but that simply writing down her abusive mother’s worst moments is cathartic, yes, but it’s not in any way compelling to read, because there is no built-up, no tension, just straight up abuse). The inexplicable decision of using a present tense killed every chance of expressing self-awareness, self-reflection and healing, and the book felt like a journaling therapy exercise. It didn’t help the fact that writing the memoir focusing on traumas and single events, each one of them taking up one short chapter, made the “narration” very disjointed.The blurb is also very unfaithful to the actual content of the book: this memoir was described as “heartbreaking” and “hilarious”, and I have my doubts about the latter. I smiled twice, in the space of 92 chapters.As a person who has a strained relationship with her mentally-ill mother, I am proud of Jennette for being able to tell her story, but unfortunately her memoir fell short, for me.!121!Wow. A very revealing and honest memoir. Unsure what parts people found funny. I didn’t laugh once and didn’t see any parts that were structured for humor. Nickelodeon and Disney was a huge part of my childhood and I loved iCarly and loved Sam. Hearing Jennette’s story is another example of how you don’t know what’s happening to someone behind closed doors. As talented as she was in acting, I’m glad she made the decision to walk away. No one should be forced into a career they never wanted - especially a career as draining and consuming emotionally, mentally and physically as acting. Her mother’s abuse was tough to hear. It’s more painful to see how much Jennette wanted to appease her mom all the way until the very end of her life. She consistently put her mom’s needs before her own and her mom would willingly exploit and manipulate her knowing this. The title and cover is alarming and provocative but justified. If you assume Jennette never loved her mother, the story proves the exact opposite. The title is not a reflection of Jennette but the treatment of her mother towards her. Her mother severely betrayed and abused her and Jennette loved her while she was alive despite it. But time and healing allowed her to see the long term damage her mother has done and some damage is irreversible. Her story sheds more light to how we shouldn’t turn a blind eye to all the different forms, relationships and dynamics abuse can happen. If anything, parental abuse should be looked at with the utmost seriousness due to the power dynamic and pressures to love your family despite their faults, even when they hurt you. I could go on, but if any part of her story interests you, I would recommend reading. Major trigger warnings for abuse, eating disorders, bulimia, and anorexia. She is very blunt and candid about her life with eating disorders. Jennette from an early age wanted to write but her mom didn’t support her. I’m glad Jennette is finally able to do what she always wanted.!121!my blog review
TW: Anorexia, abuse (emotional, child), bulimia, cancer, eating disorders, drugs and alcohol abuse, death, grief, mental illness, manipulation, grooming.To me, reading and rating a memoir is something delicate, because that person is opening up about their experiences, their traumas, thoughts and emotions that are very private or painful sometimes.Wow, I have no words. I'm just proud of Jennette and wish for her the best because she deserves a good life, happiness and so much love.Must of us grew up watching Nickelodeon shows like iCarly, Drake & Josh, Big Time Rush, Zoey 101 and many more, laughing at many characters' jokes or actions, not knowing that perhaps some of those actors were having a really bad time.This memoir isn't about Jennette's days in Nickelodeon, yes, she talks about some of her struggles. This memoir is about her early years, before and getting in the entertainment industry, her teen years and early adulthood. It's really painful to read about Jennette's struggles with food. While on iCarly she (her character) was obsessed with food, Jennette was obsessed with it, too, but not in the same way. Her mother impossed onto her this unhealthy routine that developed in anorexia and years later in bulimia.This book is totally worth to read. And I totally loved it. Jennette is a wonderful story-teller, I liked the writing, that is so captivating and beautiful. I'm really proud of her and wish to her nothing but happiness.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Mental Health', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']"
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life (Paperback),Mark Manson,3.89,1100280,2016,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word ""fuck"" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.!121!Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i don't usally go for self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they’re choosing to find important in life and what they’re choosing to find unimportant.These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is.Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.The Feedback Loop from HellThere’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?!121!“Giving too many fucks is bad for you.” The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck ~~  Mark MansonWhere to begin? Well for starters,  Mark Manson is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than  Mark Manson. Why? He doesn't put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He won't tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out. And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you. Oh, let's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the The GODDAMN Beatles. What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with FUCK and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It's not. Manson proudly announces he cuts through the crap! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, and old soul. There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Or how about this gem: ""While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience."" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I can't help but think of Emerson, “Its the not the Destination, It's the journey.” Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this generation-defining self-help guide. Most of Manson's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without  Mark Manson?Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I'll read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just don't give a fuck ...!121!Has anybody been unfortunate enough to be sitting in a pub/restaurant, enjoying the ambience and possibly a meal, and out of nowhere, a rather drunk individual parks himself beside you, grinning profusely, and then just doesn't stop talking about his life, your life and everything HE thinks that you should be doing, but without any solid proof to back himself up? I have, and this book by Mark Manson made me feel like I was back in that pub, but with an even dodgier individual attempting to give me life lessons. Seeing this book for the first time, I'll admit, I was pretty revved up about reading it. I mean, lets be honest, a bright orange cover with ""The subtle art of not giving a f*ck"" boldly plastered on it, you can hardly miss it. The book began with an introduction, which made me feel like this was was going to be a truly life changing read. But, from the words ""Chapter one"" it all took a swift nose dive. Manson began the first few chapters with a lot of ""Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you"" kind of attitude. I can take cursing, but this, this was kind of tiring. It was like listening to a young person that has just discovered the art of cursing. It sucked and it was unnecessary.There were some interesting points, but you need to dig deep to find them. I found that this book contained mostly opinions, with a few hidden facts chucked in for good measure. I cannot understand how Romeo and Juliet could be brought into this book, then a couple of pages later, Buddhism, and then many fucks later, he is telling us that HE is amazing, as he has the audacity to inform his wife when she looks shitty, and, best of all, apparently she loves that. I just don't buy it.For me, this book is just a preachy retelling of things we already know, written by an average male and, I'm still trying to understand what possessed me to spend actual money on this! Absolutely no fucks given.!121!There are a lot of points in the first half of the book that I agree with: prioritizing fewer things and the right things; defining the right values and what you are willing to struggle for; being addicted to outrage and victimhood to avoid responsibility and acknowledging mistakes; etc. However, the tone is VERY heavy on this edgy dudebro persona that gets tiring easily, especially in the beginning where the author drops the F bomb every other sentence in order to seem “real” and contrarian. The book would probably be most appealing to straight white men, since there are some parts of advice that would not resonate well with other groups - for example, he talks about the entitlement of victimhood and how that prevents positive change, which is true to a certain extent if we were to look at specific places like twitter, but should not be boasted as blanket statements coming from a white man who admits to coming from a wealthy family. The second half of the book is the weakest, as it starts to dwindle with advice on love and relationships and some of the author’s hokey philosophy on life and death - these parts were too trite for my tastes and felt like he was trying to halfheartedly wrap up the book in a meaningful way now that we were getting to the end. Ultimately, I am settling on 3 stars because there are still some values that I agree with and will take away from this book (and hope other people will too), but not for some of the others, and certainly not with the author’s writing voice.!121!I'm not actually done yet, but this book is becoming more problematic by the page. In re: false memories and page 128: False memories are absolutely a thing. But when the example you use to illustrate this fact is a 1980's feminist who falsely accused her father of abuse and you follow up with ""in the early 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it"" you are being supremely irresponsible. The casual reader who is not familiar with sexual violence and rape and abuse could easily walk away with the impression that survivors of sexual assault often make up their assault. This is utterly, utterly untrue - we know that rape and incest are some of the most under reported and under prosecuted crimes, and that the possibility of not being believed plays a big role in that.***Finally finished. One star. You don't need to read this book.!121!I started out liking this book, I really did. By the time I was halfway in, his smug attitude about things he frankly knows jack shit about were getting on my nerves. He made some excellent points, all of which have been made countless times by other, more competent writers. Read Sartre, Camus, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and various Buddhist texts instead. Regurgitating Eastern philosophy and existentialism while swearing a lot only gets you so far. I stopped reading and returned this book.!121!It's a very surface level look at Stoicism and western Buddhism aimed at dudebros. It has some good things to say, and it's a decent introduction to some great concepts, but it's pretty cringe and misogynistic.I would suggest Why Buddhism is True and The Practicing Stoic instead as much better books to read that cover the same ground more in depth, without any of the negatives.!121!What a load of self-indulgent, sexist codswallop.!121!Have you ever been in a bar and had a know-it-all tell you everything you need to know about life without any evidence to back up what he's saying? That's what this book felt like.!121!Definitely written by and for straight, white, entitled males. I have no fucks to give for this book or the author.!121!you think you're getting a light, irreverent lifestyle/self-help book, but then it's actually just a few good ideas taken from Buddhism and then mixed in with conservative nonsense about ""snowflakes,"" mixed with some casual misogyny and backdoor bragging. A book only a white straight man with rich parents could write.!121!""This is something called maturity. It's nice; you should try it sometimes.""There weren't any 1 or 2-star rated books on my GR shelves until now. If I find a book is not working out the way I had hoped, I stay away from it, and will not invest any more time. This is the first book to contradict this practice. Based on the hype, I was looking forward to enjoying this book for a very long time. When I finally started, I quickly got the impression that this is not for me. But even with getting do-not-continue warning signs right from the start, I proceeded till the end, hoping something will change my opinion. Well, if I had received any help from this book, that would be with 'not giving a f*ck' about this book, and move on. I even feel like I'm being generous giving 2-stars instead of one, but that's only for the interesting example stories author presented (only the stories, not the author's opinions) and for the obvious difficulties of life that we all already know.""Rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best.""""If you're able to not give a f*ck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""Starting from the first chapter, I had the vague feeling that I had dived into a Gladwell 'self-help' book. The obvious (and simple) truths about life and circumstances are presented in a very amusing manner, sandwiched between what I felt to be inexperienced conjecture of the author. True, there were a few good parts, and I would even categorized them as helpful, but it felt those truths had been taken out of context to suit to the author's own views. Initially, I had the impression, may be the book is moving along the lines of the art of letting go, but that also stopped very quickly. According to the author, there's a line separating what's worth or not giving attention to, and our principles are only valid based on which side of the line we're at. Even the almost annoying number of 'f*cks' diminished after a few chapters, to proceed along what felt like a very long rant.""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a f*ck about what's truly f*ckworthy.""""Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're the same things.""I'm a Buddhist, and would like to consider myself at least somewhat familiar with Buddhism. As the enlightenment is accepted to be related to letting go of the worldly pleasures according to Buddhism, Manson takes this as an example to justify his opinions. Then, he goes and creates a line, which he thinks is from where the letting-go should be applied to. It's not that the content are false, but everything's completely taken out of the original context, and I'm failing to see how any of this is supposed to be 'helpful'. One could certainly empathize with everything stated here, and agree to most of it, but that's pretty much it: I couldn't find the self-help part (if there was any). If the book's intention was to make one immune (or resistant) to the difficulties the society put in one's way (as the name implies), at least for me, it failed spectacularly. After the first few chapters, it often felt like the author contradicting himself with what followed. ""Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature.""""The greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear.""Just like with a Gladwell book, I think one should read this book carefully, especially if the reader is new to self-help/ philosophy genres. If you're already familiar with some good/ logical philosophy books, chances are, you'll take everything in this with a grain of salt, and only extract what's helpful. However, when a non-fiction book gets this much popularity, this could even become the very first self-help book one reads. And that's a dangerous thing, to start along with a system that accepts 'expecting the negative to happen to be a positive thing'. As the experiences/ examples presented are clear, and very easy to relate to, it's easy to get completely lost in a philosophy like this. I still decided to share some (obvious) wisdom quotes, but I hope you won't be tempted to read this one because of them. On the contrary, I'm only reviewing this one to warn any future readers, especially if you're new to self-help or non-fiction books.""People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from their mistakes.""!121!I don't read self-help. I simply don't believe in the self-help genre. If you need a book to help you live your life you have bigger problems than whatever brought you to that book. That may seem harsh but its just my opinion and you are free to ignore it.Since I don't read self-help, you may be asking ""Erin, Why did you read this book? Blame Popsugar. I'm doing the Popsugar 2017 Reading challenge and needed to read a book from a genre I don't usually read. As you can see if you look at my book shelf I pretty much read every genre. So I narrowed it down to 3 genres: Self-help, Christian, or Amish Romance. I picked Self-help. Mark Manson is proof that anyone can get a book deal. I understand that he has a very popular blog and publishing is about money but God this book is bad. I found myself speed reading it just so it would end. Mark Manson is shallow, smug, and completely uninformed about everything that he was trying to talk about. You know what I don't give a fuck about? This book. DON'T READ IT. AVOID AT ALL COST! Popsugar 2017 Reading Challenge: Bestseller from a Genre I Don't Normally Read.!121!Based on the title, I was pretty stoked for this, and the introductory essay explaining the author's Not Giving a F*ck theory made a lot of sense to me and made me really happy. Essentially, he says that the internet and the media demand that we give a f*ck about everything, but we only have so much time on Earth and so many f*cks to give and we have to choose who and what we spend those f*cks on. Makes sense.Unfortunately, the rest of the book turns into the same self-help drivel you see in any other ""how to be happy"" kind of book, only Manson starts to present the information with a tone reminiscent of an Andrew Dice Clay routine. No bueno. I ended up having to bail.!121!In a Way, He Has a Point!أولا لا يمكن أبدا تصنيف هذا الكتاب على أنه تنمية بشريةعلى الأقل لا يندرج تحت النمط التقليدي لهذا النوع من الكتبوهذه هي أول نقطة تحسب لهثانياالكتاب محكم ويقدم أفكاره بوضوحدون مط أو تطويل وهي أفكار ستجد بينها على الأقل فكرة واحدة إن طبقتها قد تتحسن حياتك بصورة ملحوظةثالثاقد لا أتفق مع كل ما جاء بالكتاب ولكن هذا لا يمنعني من احترامهبل وأجده يستحق شهرتهوهو لن يكون مضيعة لوقت قارئههذا ما أنا متأكدة منهرابعاإذا كنت في حالة شفقة على الذات فقد يكون هذا الكتاب بمثابة صفعة قوية على وجهكفاحذرلكنك تحتاجه إن تمتعت بما يكفي من الموضوعية وانفتاح الذهنصدقني .. أنت تحتاجه ولكن كالعلاج النفسيتحتاج للاعتراف بمشكلتك تلك أولا!121!My, my! What a catchy title!I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I picked this up. And now that I'm done? Well, I agree with everything Manson says, but (like other reviewers have mentioned) everything he's written about is common sense stuff. Is that revolutionary?Maybe.What does it say about our society in general that any of what he's saying is...well, remotely necessary to say!?When the basic premise of a bestseller is that you should stop comparing yourself to what you see on television, movies, and social media, and just be content to be the best version of yourself - and scads of people find this to be awe-inspiring? Then perhaps it really did need to be said.The gist of this ""groundbreaking"" book is that there's no way to insulate yourself from bad times, and even if you could, those hardships are what make us better people. One of the biggest problems we seem to have is this nonsensical idea that chasing happiness is a worthwhile goal. I mean, it sounds great on paper, but it's not in any way, shape, or form realistic...or healthy. Life will not give you a happy ending. Period. Endings are always sad. And we need to get over this ridiculous idea that at some point we'll get to sigh a big sigh of relief because our fairytale Happily Ever After has arrived.We can all save ourselves the trouble of trying to find happiness by just realizing that we need to choose to be happy now. Enjoy the small stuff, my friends, because tomorrow might just suck a giant dick. Your life will be good until it isn't. You'll be in love until you aren't. Your job will be fulfilling until you lose it. You'll be alive until you're dead. And nothing you do will change that.Ok, granted, that doesn't sound awesome.But the point is, if you stop trying to live for some future Happiness High, prioritize what means the most to you now, and live with a fearless attitude towards the future? Then you're going to be much more content (and yes, happy) than someone who is constantly trying to measure up to unrealistic goals they've set in order achieve a sense of fulfillment.The end.The book itself is fairly short and Manson's voice isn't terribly annoying.Read it or not. I don't give a fuck.!121!Ego driven rantings Wish I could say I couldn't give a fu#k about spending £10.99 on this serious heap of rubbish, but yes, i do give a fu#k that this ego driven, talentless author swindled me out of money for a heap of rubbish. He is probably having a great old laugh at the fact that his mantra `dont try` has resulted in an awful written book, full of cliches, calling reader `dumbass`, referring to us wanting to feel jennifer aniston`s t#ts , and bigging himself up generally. He probably finds it hilarious that a load of suckers, like me , bought it. The zen in me tells me lesson is learned, don't fall for arresting titles and stop being impressed by introductory chapters referencing Bukowski. Don't make this mistake again!!!Ah, the money probably brings him little happiness. He probably in dire need of therapy or funds to hire ladies resembling Friends characters or writing classes. All is well with the world and I am happy these are much needed things my contribution can go toward.All's ok now. Don't give a fu#k.!121!Whenever a young white dude claims to hold some kind of universal truth, he's usually just talking about himself. And when he's not talking about himself or his sexual exploits, he's mansplaining Eastern philosophy and reminding us that the key to happiness is the acceptance of our own death, which is the only thing I'm thinking about after finishing this book.!121!- بعض الألم في العيون + الأرق دفعاني لسماع هذا الكتاب قبل النوم في الأمس. كان الإختيار بالصدفة. والنتيجة ممتازة، فقد غفوت قبل انتهائه ☺ لكنني عدت واكملته صباحاً.- انا لا اقتنع بكتب التحفيز الشخصي والبحث عن السعادة والإيجابية في الحياة والى ما هنالك من عناوين فضفاضة، لأن الإنسان هو تجربة بحد ذاته، وكل تجربة تختلف عن الأخرى، وما يناسب انسان لا يناسب انسانا آخراً.- فكرة تقبل الفشل فكرة وجودية، لأن شعور الفشل يحطم الناس ويحولهم الى ضعفاء او جبناء في مواجهة الحياة.. - معظم ما جاء في الكتاب سيكتسبه الإنسان بالتجربة الشخصية، وما النجاح الا مجموعة تراكمات لتجارب فاشلة.- العالم غرق في المادية، والكثير من الأولويات هي كماليات بالفعل لكن التطور صيرها اولوية. ووسائل الاعلام فعلت فعلها كذلك. العالم غير متصالح مع نفسه لذلك يغرق في الفشل والكآبة.- القصص كانت جميلة في الكتاب خصوصا قصة بوكوفوفسكي وشعاره (لا تحاول)، اما الإستنتاجات فلم تكن اكتشافات بل نتائج طبيعية. ولعل الجزء الثاني بأكمله اختصره أبي العلاء ببيت شعر واحد:"" تعب كلها الحياة فما اعجب براغب في ازدياد""- زدت اقتناعا ان هذا النوع من الكتب من غير فائدة كبيرة لمن لهم تجربة فاعلة في الحياة. لكنه ممتع الى حد ما.!121!I went into this admittedly with quite some skepticism and entitlement— “what is this going to teach me that I don’t already know?”— but The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is truly one of the most ground-shaping nonfiction books I’ve read so far. It will and can change a perspective, a life. And as such, this is the perfect book to give to your loved ones on holidays, birthdays...It made me rethink all the times I ever gave a fuck over some of the most irrelevant things in hindsight. It made me realize that it’s sometimes necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate why I think so-and-so on a daily basis.I also wrote down a lot of Mark Manson’s writing into my notes because I knew I would need it in the near future. And I would like to thank him for answering quite a lot of fears of mine with such a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was both personally relevant and entertaining.Here are a few pieces that helped me and then some:“The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.”“Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere”YES! This is exactly how I feel when I give too many fucks about things that have little lasting impact on my life.“Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark,” the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. “The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.”A moment passed, and then I wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from. And while we’re at it, who made these margaritas?“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”Disappointment Panda was one of the best additions to this book.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of “no pain, no gain.” This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.See: it’s a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.”This book is slowly but surely shifting my world.“If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.”“Honesty is a good value because it’s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others (even if it’s sometimes unpleasant). Popularity, on the other hand, is a bad value. If that’s your value, and if your metric is being the most popular guy/girl at the dance party, much of what happens will be out of your control: you don’t know who else will be at the event, and you probably won’t know who half those people are. Second, the value/metric isn’t based on reality: you may feel popular or unpopular, when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you. (Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)”That side note is speaking the truth!!!“I’m not saying that this excused what my ex did—not at all. But recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that I perhaps hadn’t been the innocent victim I’d believed myself to be. That I had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did. After all, people who date each other tend to have similar values. And if I dated someone with shitty values for that long, what did that say about me and my values? I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it.”Taking responsibly for your actions, but not blaming yourself was one of the most valuable lessons I got from Mark Manson.“A lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like, “Okay, but how? I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I’m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience—but how do I change?”And to this I say, in my best Yoda impersonation: “Do, or do not; there is no ‘how.’ ”You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.It really is that simple. It’s just not easy.It’s not easy because you’re going to feel like a loser, a fraud, a dumbass at first. You’re going to be nervous. You’re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process. These are all side effects of changing your values, of changing the fucks you’re giving. But they are inevitable.It’s simple but really, really hard.”“Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.”He’s changing my world right now.“We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don’t mean to, that’s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we’re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change.In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities.I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.”I didn't even realize I felt this way until I saw it so clearly on paper.“There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.”This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe.My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.”That thing about the plane is 100% me!! So I get it know: if you think you’re special—decide not to be.“The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away.”“If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you’ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.”

Damn, I wasn’t prepared for The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck to completely change my worldview in such a meaningful way. I will cherish this book for a long time to come.4.5/5 stars*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

This review and more can be found on my blog.!121!Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPsychological snake oil for the pseudo intellectual.Man, reading this book was so frustrating, because I'd heard so many good things. Some people told me that this book was life-changing, game-changing, and then one of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought, ""Cool, bring it on. I'm ready to hand out fuck-wafers like it's time for the Sunday Communion of Nobody-Gives-A-Damn."" After reading this book, I've come to the conclusion that the people who like this book haven't taken any psychology classes or read any philosophy books, because this is like the watered-down, urban legend- and common sense-based rehashing of basic tenets you would learn in Phi or Psych 101. Mark Manson seems to me like a dudebro, tossing around the word ""fuck"" like a preteen who's just discovered swearing. But only for the first couple chapters. Then he forgets himself to his navel-gazing, talking about how we should change our values in life and how emotions only affect us insofar as we let them. Which is true, to an extent, but then he brings up how someone who had lost their son prematurely got mad at him on his blog, and Manson gets so upset about it that he feels the need to whine about his experience here, bragging to us about how he decided not to have the last word. But isn't that what you're doing here? You are giving a fuck, and you are immortalizing that fuck you gave in print, while telling us simultaneously that you did not give it. Hmm, sketchy.He also talks about his trip to Russia and praises the Russians for not sugar-coating and telling it like it is, the takeaway being that he admired them for saying ""That's stupid,"" when someone says something stupid. Then he brags about how he likes to tell his wife when she doesn't look good, and how much she appreciates this gaslighting, and how few men would dare to do this amazing thing that he is doing (telling her she looks like shit, according to him). She gets angry, he says, but ultimately she appreciates his honesty. Yeah, I fucking bet. This was straight out of those gross pick-up artist books that teach generations of young males how to neg women to win sex points. #NotAllMenManson had a couple good points, but they were buried in a lot of garbage. For example, in a chapter about relationships, he opens up with the synopsis of Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary example, but then he also tries to namedrop actual science like Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiments, and then also namedrops the Buddha when talking about suffering and the inevitability of pain and strife. I am a psychology major who worked in a research laboratory as an undergraduate and I like hard science with data and solid case examples. When I see an article that looks fishy, I look up the facts to determine whether or not it is true. I read scholarly articles. I don't fuck with bullshit. I would rather give a fuck than fuck with bullshit, if you get me. This book did not have facts. It had a lot of opinions masquerading with facts, but honestly, if I want someone to preach dime-store philosophy at me, I'll go to a bar in downtown San Francisco and listen to the vodka fume revelations of CFOs.2 fucks given!121!Cum, Doamne, să fie „un ghid revoluționar”, cînd e vorba de fapt de o supă reîncălzită? Ca să fii fericit, crede Manson, se cuvine:- Să-ți pese cu adevărat doar de chestiile importante; le poți număra pe degetele unei singure mîini. Dar cum deosebești chestiile importante de cele neimportante, dai cu banul?- Să nu-ți pese de ce gîndesc alții despre tine, să nu te enervezi la cap :). Nervii, invidia, ura nu duc la fericire. Cred și eu. Oricum, Nietzsche a spus-o mult mai bine, acum o sută și ceva de ani: „Smulge din tine buruiana resentimentului!”.- Să-ți alegi un scop în viață, dar să știi că nu împlinirea scopului, ci drumul pînă la el te face fericit. Dacă ai realizat ceva și te oprești (ca să-ți serbezi succesul), fericirea te părăsește cu grăbire.- Să nu-ți faci probleme pentru evenimentele care se petrec oricum, indiferent că vrei sau nu vrei. Nu poți controla totul. Unele lucruri (cele mai multe) nu sînt în puterea ta, altele (foarte puține) sînt. De pildă, modul de a judeca lucrurile care nu sînt în puterea ta. Sigur, Epictet și Seneca au spus asta cu mult timp în urmă, dar nu strică s-o repeți. Repetitio mater studiorum est...- Să nu-ți dorești o experiență pozitivă (mai mult sex, să spunem), pentru că vei încerca, în realitate, o experiență negativă. Dar dacă accepți o experiență negativă, poți trăi una pozitivă.- Ferește-te de plăceri: sînt nocive! Antihedonismul lui Mark Manson e mai vechi decît Seneca.- Nu fugi de suferințe! Viața înseamnă să-ți asumi suferința. Suferința face parte din viață. Cît trăiești, suferi, dar dacă suferi, asta înseamnă foarte precis că ești încă viu :)Mă opresc aici. Cartea e o sumă înfiorătoare de banalități. Prefer să-i recitesc pe stoici...!121!It's not about not giving a f*ck about anything, it's about giving a f*ck about the things that matter most. In essence, the question is, should I really give a f*ck?  This is sort of an anti-hero self-help book, something you should read (or hear) if you feel the world weighing up a little bit too much. It just unburdens you of some stuff. No real groundbreaking philosophy, just a couple of useful hints and insights on how to take things more lightly, when taking them seriously is hurting you. Chapters 1 and 2 were pure magic. The kind of magic that wouldn't be too bad to hear once or twice a year. If not for the hints, for the laughs. There are also some interesting comments on chapter 8, and some anecdotes here and there. The rest of the book was kind of meh. Funny meh, sure, but typical self-help textbook lines that tires a bit, if not a lot. Couldn't be happier to have chosen audio rather than ebook. Cursing can seem very aggressive when reading it on text, but hearing it through the voice of the narrator it became so much easier, and funnier. Tips: Don't take it too seriously, develop a tolerance to hear the word f*ck once too many often, and just enjoy the ride.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2016] [212p] [Inspirational] [Conditional Recommendable] ----------------------------------------------- No es sobre que nada te importe un c*rajo. Es sobre que te importe un c*rajo sólo las cosas importantes. En esencia, la pregunta es, debería realmente importame un c*rajo?  Este es como el anti-heroe de los libros de autoayuda. Algo que uno debería leer (o escuchar) si empezás a sentír que el mundo te pesa mucho sobre los hombros. Sólo te libera de algunas cosas. No tiene ninguna filosofía innovadora, sólo un par de consejos y observaciones sobre cómo tomar las cosas más ligeramente, cuando tomártelas en serio te hace daño.Los capítulos 1 y 2 fueron pura magia. Ese tipo de magia que no viene mal escucharla una o dos veces al año. Sino por los consejos, por las risas. Tiene también algunos comentarios interesantes en el capítulo 8, y alguna que otra anéctoda aquí y allá. El resto del libro es medio meh, meh gracioso sí, pero típica retórica de autoayuda que cansa un poco, sino mucho.No podría estar más feliz de haberlo escuchado en vez de leerlo. Las puteadas pueden sonar muy agresivas cuando uno las lee en texto, pero escucharlas a través de la voz del narrador hace que sea mucho más ameno, y gracioso.Consejos: No tomarlo muy en serio, desarrollar una tolerancia a escuchar puteadas algo más que seguido, y sólo disfrutar el viaje.-----------------------------------------------
NOTA PERSONAL
: [2016] [212p] [Inspiracional] [Recomendable Condicional] -----------------------------------------------!121!This book has made a significant impact in recent times in the life of readers (both in a positive and negative way). Let us analyze whether it differs from other books published with similar ideas.
The Good 
🔸 This is one of the first books where the author was bold enough to discuss the toxic positivity spread by self-help books and self-help gurus. It will help those trapped in the vicious cycle of toxic positivity.🔸 This is different from the usual self-help books, right from the color of its cover and its title. Due to its presentation and content, this book will stand out and catch a glimpse of the reader in any bookstore.🔸 Some ideas regarding life and future expectations explained by the author will definitely resonate with the readers.
My favorite three lines from this book. 


 “The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. ”


 “This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes.”

 “Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.”

The Bad 
🔹 Using the f word will be ok to most of the readers. But in the initial few chapters, the reader is bombarded with too many f words in a patronizing manner that the reader will start getting bored when he sees the f word.🔹 If you are familiar with Zen Buddhism, you will notice that the author is mentioning many Buddhist ideas as his own in a slightly different manner. 🔹 Some of the chapters in the latter half of this book seem to be loosely written.
The Ugly 
♦️ This will be the toughest part to read for some of the readers. Sexual abuse can never be considered a joke. The way the author looks at sexual abuse will make the reader angry if you are a victim or knows someone who is a victim or have treated someone who is a victim. This is the area that makes the author and this book look ludicrous. ♦️ The use of “charged language” and a harsh approach to the reader might be acceptable to a certain extent. In some areas, the author crosses the boundary and reaches the bullying territory, especially how he looks at victimhood.There are so many positives and negatives to this book. Since this is one of the first books that tried to view self-help from a different angle, it will be a good choice for those who want to get a different reading experience.!121!A lot of necessary to hear hard truths.There is a distinction between what the title implies and what Manson intends. Manson is essentially inviting us to only care about what’s important and let the rest take care of itself.I’ve been accused of indifference or “living in a bubble” for years because I don’t follow politics and rarely watch the news. My mantra is the serenity prayer:God grant me the serenityto accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.My Muslim friends will sometimes say “Inshallah” which literally translates into “if Allah wills it” or “If God wills it”. When I first heard this, I mistakenly thought it was akin to “screw it” or “I don’t care” but I think this is more similar to the serenity prayer and also what Manson is talking about.I learned years ago that I cannot help or fix everything and to even try is unfair to me, the people I most care about and ultimately the people I am trying to help also. Spread yourself too thin, care too much, give a f*** about stuff that is beyond your reach, and you’re setting yourself up for failure.Manson steers clear of religion for the most part (he does reference Buddhism a few times) and most of his self-help is philosophical in nature. He also provides plenty of illuminating anecdotes to illustrate his perspicacious observations. This also made me consider Aaron James’ 2012 book Assholes: A Theory as Manson spends a fair amount of time describing the actions and motivations of those among us who feel entitled.A fun and insightful book.** 2018 - Great book to think back on and its simple truths. I do give a f***, but I can't fix everything and I accept that. Ultimately its about boundaries and priorities.!121!💀 DNF at 29% By the end of chapter 1, I was OD'ing on the word fuck. Unbelievably improbable as it sounds, my best friend Kara Gillian has nothing on this guy here. And that, my Little Barnacles, is saying a whole bloody fucking lot.By the end of chapter 2, I'd had it with Mark Manson's smug, narcissistic, sanctimonious, clichéd-to-death-and-back, infantilizing, everyone-but-me-is-a-fucking complete-dumbass, self-indulgent, shamelessly-repackaged-Eastern-philsophy-for-nitwits rubbish hogwash drivel poppycock balderdash gibberish sorry I ran out of polite synonyms CRAP.By the end of chapter 3, I didn't give a bloody stinking fuck anymore. Yay! Mission accomplished and stuff! P.S. I'm so joyfully, blissfully happy I DNFed the fuck fish out of this one before getting to the sexist bullshit. Hadn't I displayed such amazing powers of prescience and precognition and stuff, the murderous crustaceans would have no doubt been slightly unleashed on a certain person who, come to think of it, probably would not have given half a quarter of a fuck about it, because he is so wonderfully detached like that. Oh, and by the way:You're welcome.!121!My sister asked me to get her this and I’ve read it as well. It is basically the Buddha and Sartre giving advice by saying fuck every other word. Not a terrible thing, in itself, but a bit like seeing a play where all the actors are naked, the swearing loses its impact after about the third fuck, and then you’re just left with the advice.I don’t normally read self-help books – the problem I have with them is the first word, more than the second. We generally all need some sort of help, but that rarely is helped much by any notion of ‘self’. Ultimately, this guy says much the same thing, which rather surprised me, but shouldn’t have – I’ve already mentioned Buddhism, which has a particularly low opinion of selfhood. But we are so obsessed with being individuals in our society that he probably didn’t feel he could just come out and say from the start – well, get over yourself, fuck face.His advice is basically that you only have so many fucks you can give in life – but life tries to structure itself so that we are in a near perpetual state of outrage. And that way heart attacks lie. His advice isn’t to stop caring, that would be impossible, but to try to decide what you are going to care about and, well, do something about that. In some ways this isn’t too different from something I read by Byung-Chul Han recently – that outrage never changed the world, only rage can. So, pick what you are going to be enraged about and skip the outrage.This isn’t a terrible book, in fact, most of the advice is quite reasonable. All the same, I feel most of the problems we face as humans are to do with the fact we are social animals and our lives are becoming increasingly insular – not least due to various forms of technology – and this is making us feel pretty awful about ourselves. We need to find ways to rebuild communities and meaningful human interactions. And we’ve known this for ages – have a quick read of Durkheim’s Suicide and his explanation of why Catholics and Jews have lower rates of suicide than Protestants. Our obsession with being individuals is literally killing us. The fact this guy bases much of his advice on psychology, to me anyway, is part of the problem – I figure it involves him looking intently down the wrong end of the telescope – but all the same, this is a quick and easy read and parts of it are amusing.!121!4 stars!

This book wasn't only about giving no fucks, it was about giving fucks about only the important things. If you're going to read it, I would recommend the audio book. I thought the narration was great and it was highly entertaining and made me laugh out loud more than once!!!121!The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: About This Book!","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Business']"
"Night  (The Night Trilogy, #1)",Elie Wiesel,4.37,1237219,1956,"Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944 to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. Night is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. This new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects important details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel's testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must simply never be allowed to happen again.","The author, who is actually in the above picture, said it best in the forward; “Only those who experienced Auschwitz know what it was.” I think we can all agree with that. But can we, the reader, even understand what happened there? Can modern men and women comprehend that cursed universe? I’m not entirely sure.I first read this in my eighth grade History class. I was 13. It changed my life. Before this book my world was sunshine and rainbows. My biggest concern was whether or not a boy named Jason liked me back. I got mad at my mom when she made me go to bed on time, I complained if I didn’t like what we were having for dinner and I argued about what I was and wasn’t allowed to watch on TV. I thought I knew about WWII. Both of my grandfathers served in it and so my parents wanted to make sure that we understood the sacrifices they made, the things they saw. I watched documentaries about it with my father, the history nerd, listened to the few stories that my grandfathers would tell, but up until that point I had been intentionally sheltered from the horrors of the holocaust. I had only been told in the vaguest terms what had happened, that so many millions of people had been killed, that Hitler and his men had sought to exterminate the Jewish people. My parents wanted to spare me from what exactly that meant until they thought I was mature enough to be able to absorb it. But then I read this. And for the first time in my life I was completely self-aware. I felt like a child, like a complete and utter fool. For what were my “problems” compared to those of this narrator? How “hard” was my life compared to what he endured? What millions of people similarly endured? I now understood my own insignificance in the grand scheme of things and suddenly the reality of the world was a crushing weight. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. It was dark. It was ugly and unforgiveable. I remember getting really angry when I finished this. Mostly I was angry at the world and at humanity as a whole but I unfairly turned some of that on my father. After all, he hadn’t prepared me for what I found in this book. At one point I even demanded that he explain this…thing to me. He couldn’t. Fifteen years later, my second read of this book has impacted me just as much as the first. There’s this question I kept asking myself while reading. That question, was ‘How?’. I’m sure that ‘Why?’ might seem the more obvious choice here but I couldn’t let myself wander down the rabbit warren that is that question. Madness lies at the end of it. So I’m left with ‘How?’. How did this happen? How did so many average human beings contribute to this? How did the SS working in the camps reach the point that they were physically and mentally able to toss live infants into flames? How were the German girls that lived within smelling distance of Auschwitz able to pass love notes to the soldiers that marched their skeletal prisoners past? How did these same starving prisoners manage to run 20 kilometers in the freezing snow? How could the SS officers that shot them if they stopped on the first day of their death march then shout encouragements to them the next? How could the German citizens near the train tracks throw bread into the prisoners’ cattle cars just to watch them murder each other for it? How could human beings do these things to each other? How? HOW? 
HOW???
 Like my father, I have no answers.And that, I believe, is why many modern humans will never really be able to comprehend the things that happen in this book. Absorb it, yes. Bear witness to it, yes. Understand it? Hopefully never. I finished this at lunch today. And now I’m sitting in my cubicle, glancing at my neighbors and wondering if they’re capable of this kind of depravity. Am I? What would I do to survive? Would I beat my own father to death for the bread in his hand? I hope to God that none of us will ever have to find out the answers to these questions. If you read a single book in your life, this should be it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest!121!There is little that freaks me out more than the Holocaust. And I'm not belittling it at all with the phrase 'freaks me out.' Growing up in the 1970s and 80s, I felt sufficiently desensitized enough by television violence to be able to gauge how often I need to shake the jiffy pop and run to the bathroom before the program/violence resumes.Elie Wiesel's Night brings me back to my senses, makes me hate the cold hearted bitch I've learned to be. And not by some overtly dramatic rendition of the horrors of life in a concentration camp but more of the LACK of it. The down to the nitty gritty telling of what happened during the year that he was imprisoned. It wasn't going for the kick to the gut reaction, more of a confused, inconceivable retelling of day to day events, and this---this--- is what really makes me shudder and be at a loss for words. Hell, words? Who am I kidding? Try coherent thought.“I would pause at every sentence, and start over and over again. I would conjure up other verbs, other images, other silent cries. It still was not right. But what exactly was “It”? “It” was something elusive, darkly shrouded for fear of being usurped, profaned. All the dictionary had to offer seemed meager, pale lifeless.”His description of his last encounter with his mother and little sister: “An SS came towards us wielding a club. He commanded: “Men to the left! Women to the right!” Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight simple, short words. Yet that was the moment when I left my mother.”Words. The power they can hold is devastating. Yes, not a new thought, not an original one, yet fucking true nonetheless. Buna. Buchenwald. Mengele. Auschwitz. Words, but ones that incite something within. Creepy crawlies or nausea. Fear. I have met only one Holocaust survivor, that I'm aware of. And 'met' is too strong a word. I was working in a store during college and was collecting payment from a customer who handed me the money and flashed his tattoo. I paled. My eyes darted from the faded black green numbers that served as this man's identity to his face and knew that I was just another gawker. That in that one moment I had created a history for this man. No.. he WAS history. Certainly makes you rethink being pissed off that Sbarro's had left the food court. I think that my kids will most likely never meet a survivor. That books like Night and Anne Frank will have to serve as an education, a reminder that THIS, in fact, DID happen and that it is cruel and moronic and downright irresponsible to believe otherwise. I could say that I did have some sense of relief that at least I wasn't alive during this. That I didn't sit back and have some vague understanding of this going on. But, that's not really the case, right? We have Rwanda and Darfur and god knows what other insane situations happening out there---and we're outraged over the price of an iPhone. “For in the end, it is all about memory, its sources and its magnitude, and, of course, its consequences.”So, Elie Wiesel's account, at 112 pages, serves as a powerful, undeniable, testament. As simply stated as that.Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.Never shall I forget that smoke.Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and tuned my dreams to ashes.Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never. And in the Preface to the New Translation, he says:  “And yet still I wonder: Have I used the right words?' For me, yes. Most definitely, yes.!121!""Our lives no longer belong to us alone; they belong to all those who need us desperately."" - Elie Wiesel!121!This is a true account of Elie Wiesel, a 15-year old Romanian Jew. At the beginning of the book, Wiesel’s religious leader warns him of the danger, but no one listens. The family is confident that everything will be alright. However, the Germans march in without even a fight. Overnight, regulations go into effect including wearing of the yellow star. Eventually, the Jews are forced into a ghetto. Then, they are told to move. Where they were going, no one knew. They were herded into a cattle car, bound for the concentration camps. What will happen to Wiesel and his family?Night is a case where truth is stranger than fiction. It would be hard to imagine a scenario more gruesome. In the book, you can tell that Wiesel has deep regrets about choices that were made along the way. You can feel the weight, the burden on his shoulders, even though he was only an innocent teenage boy in an impossible situation.This book was a sucker punch to the solar plexus. Even in the midst of unspeakable atrocities, there was so much hope. When arriving at Auschwitz, there was a discussion about trying to escape, “Let the world learn about the existence of Auschwitz. Let everybody find out about it while they still have a chance to escape.” The sad thing is that there were people who knew and did little to nothing to help.However, I don’t want to diminish many of the brave people who risked their lives for the greater good. Before the pandemic, I was visiting the Canadian Aviation Museum, and they had a display about Operation Bad Penny/Operation Manna/Operation Chowhound. Operation Bad Penny consisted of a crew of seven men, five from Ontario, Canada, who dropped food into Netherlands to prevent the people from starving. The Germans had not yet agreed to the cease fire for the humanitarian mission so this test flight was to see if they would be shot down. They were not. This began 3,301 food drops. The Dutch people spelled out, “Many Thanks” in tulips. One of the people interrupted the tour. In a small, quavering voice, she said, “That was my grandparents. I’m from The Netherlands.

So much pain and suffering are thrown at you from the pages that one cannot comprehend it all in the right perspective. One can only move forward as the victims in this book did. Step by step, page by page. Initially, numbness is the only way to deal with such anguish. Otherwise one becomes quickly overwhelmed by the images that evoke questions that cannot be answered. And yet, I read this book from the comfort of a warm home and a full stomach. Imagine the impact if it were otherwise. Imagine being forced from your home to live in barracks, living off soup and bread, forced to go outside in the winter without a jacket, and perform manual labor from dawn to dusk with the smell of a crematorium in your backyard.How many of us could endure this for just one day, let alone, for years? What would this do to us physically and more important, what would this do to us mentally? Yet, we witness in this book the miracle of the prisoner's survival. The strength and raw endurance of the human spirit. We must be reminded of this this glorious strength, but also reminded that it was the weakness of the human spirit that inflicted these crimes on others. Humanity has the capability of extreme strength, but also of extreme weakness (which often hides under the guise of self-righteousness and need for power over others). This book is necessary in order to remind us of this. These things must not be forgotten. Read this book even if you think you have read enough of the Holocaust and of pain and suffering. Every book that I have read about the Holocaust offers something new including this one. Read it as a memorial and a tribute. Read it as a reminder of how fortunate we are to have a free society and how we must preserve this freedom at all costs. There are those who would like to take it away. Fascism is alive and well. I started reading Holocaust novels after reading Edelweiss Pirates ‘Operation Einstein'. (Edelweiss Pirates #1) [bookcover:(Edelweiss Pirates #1) ‘Operation Einstein' 

 they are must reads in this genre are of course Number the Stars 

 Number the stars.I enjoyed that authors other works. That novel was 'The Book' that turned me onto YA WW2 novels. They allow us to reflect on our own lives, learn history and become better people in general.!121!This book is a hard, righteous slap in the conscience to everyone of good will in the world and should stand as a stark reminder of both: (1) the almost unimaginable brutality that we, as a species, are capable of; and (2) that when it comes to preventing or stopping similar kinds of atrocities or punishing those that seek to perpetrate such crimes, WE ARE OUR BROTHERS' KEEPERS and must take responsibility for what occurs ""on our watch.""This remarkable story is the powerful and deeply moving account of Ellie Wiesel's personal experiences as a Hungarian Jew who is sent with his entire family to the infamous Nazi concentration camps of Auschwitz and later Buchenwald. The most chilling aspect of the narrative for me was the calm, casual way that so many of the nightmarish events that Elie witnesses were performed. For example, early on in the account, Elie is separated from his Mother and sisters (never to see them again). This life-altering, traumatically painful action is done so quickly and in such an off-handed, bureaucratic manner by the Nazis that trying to grasp the reality of it made me physically sick. That was only the beginning. Elie goes on to chronicle his subsequent attempts not to be separated from his father and the horrors he was forced to witness and endure. Along the road of this terrifying journey, we hear in Elie's own words of the growing disgust of his 13 year old self for both mankind and for God and how he eventually lost completely his own humanity in his resolve to do whatever he had to in order to stay alive. Written in a simple, unsentimental style (which makes the horrors described seem somehow more shocking), this is one of those important life-changing books that I believe everyone should read. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!121!""I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.""These words and this book just tore at my heart. I have seen Night, have heard of Night for many years now. I waited to read it, unsure what I could possibly gain from reading another account of the evil existing among our fellow human beings – I will become enraged and depressed. I can’t change history. I will be forced to examine my own faith and I don’t want to do that. But then I discovered that my son was assigned this book as part of his summer reading for a high school English class. What do I want him to learn from this book, from this dark piece of our not too distant past? Should he pass it by so that he doesn’t have to experience the horrifying details, feel the terrible injustice in this world? No. I do not want him to be a passive bystander. I want him to understand that narrow-mindedness, hatred and bigotry exist despite his fortunate and protected upbringing. Other human beings are right now suffering unimaginable sorrow, are being cruelly maltreated. History does repeat itself, perhaps with varying backgrounds, different groups of individuals. We can’t let this happen. My son needs to read this book. His children need to read this book someday. I need to read this book. I did. I read this book and I cried. I was angry. I was disgusted with humanity. I understood Elie’s words above, why he felt such despair. Everyone should read this book at least once. This is a slim book with a tremendous message. ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.""!121!The first time I read Night by Eli Wiesel I was in an eighth grade religious school class. At that time it had recently become a law in my state to teach the Holocaust as part of the general curriculum, and, as a result, my classmates and I were the torchbearers to tell people to never forget and were inundated with quality Holocaust literature. Yet even though middle school students can comprehend Night, the subject matter at times is still way over their heads. The book itself although a prize winner blended into the religious school class and receded to the back of my memory bank. These years later I have been enjoying a religious lifestyle for my adult life. Upon hearing that Nobel Laureate Eli Wiesel passed away recently I thought now was as good of a time as any to reread his award winning account of surviving the Holocaust. Although only 120 pages in length, Wiesel's memoir of life in the concentration camps is one of the most powerful pieces of literature that most people will ever read. Wiesel discusses his relationship with G-D and talks about his conflicting feelings in regards to taking care of his father while in Buna and Birkenau camps. It was not easy to digest. Wiesel also writes in length about observing Rosh Hashanah while in the concentration camps. Why praise the Almighty for one's deliverance if one's existence is spent as a prisoner living on crusts of bread? It was easy to forget G-D or denounce His existence, even for the most religious Jews. These passages brought me close to tears. On this eve of Rosh Hashanah I can thank the Blessed Creator that I enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. Even though the world is far from perfect, my family lives in a land of freedom and are free to worship as we choose. Eli Wiesel brought Holocaust awareness to many people and earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. His passing is indicative that few survivors are still with us and we should hear their stories while we still can. Night is a painful yet necessary read, and by reading it I can go into the new year thanking G-D for my right to live in relative peace and prosperity.!121!COSA È PIÙ ETERNO DELL’INFERNO? L'uomo è più forte e più grande di dio. L'uomo è più buono e misericordioso di dio.Deluso da Adamo ed Eva, dio li scacciò dal paradiso. Deluso dalla generazione di Noè, s'inventò il diluvio universale. Deluso da Sodoma, fece piovere dal cielo il fuoco e lo zolfo. Per non farsi raggiungere dagli uomini che costruivano la torre che doveva raggiungere il cielo e portarli più vicino a lui, confuse le loro lingue e s'inventò Babele. E invece, gli uomini che hanno riempito i campi di concentramento, traditi e abbandonati da dio, che li ha lasciati torturare, morire di fame, bruciare, gassare, sgozzare tra loro, che fanno? Pregano dio e lodano il suo nome (p. 69).Un dio che si manifesta per mettere alla prova, vediamo se siete in grado di dominare i cattivi istinti e di uccidere il satana che è in voi, castigando spietatamente gli uomini (p. 49-50). Dio che si fa battere da Hitler, l'unico che ha veramente mantenuto le sue promesse, tutte le sue promesse col popolo ebraico (p. 81)!121!Every time I read books like this I’m beyond heartbroken. Just read it. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾!121!Deeply moving, man’s inhumanity to man never fails to shock.!121!This book has garnered so many five-star reviews and deals with such important subject matter that it almost feels like an act of heresy to give it a mere four stars. Yet that is exactly what I'm going to do, for while Night is a chilling account of the Holocaust and the dehumanisation and brutalisation of the human spirit under extreme circumstances, the fact remains that I've read better ones. Better written ones, and more insightful ones, too.Night is Elie Wiesel's somewhat fictionalised account of the year he spent at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. It's a chilling story about his experiences in and between concentration camps, his gradual loss of faith (he was a very observant Jew who obviously wondered where God was while his people were being exterminated), and his feelings of guilt when he realised that his struggle for survival was making him insensitive towards his dying father. It's gruesome, chilling material, and I felt very quiet after having read it. Yet I also felt vaguely unsatisfied with the book. I wanted more detail. I wanted fleshed-out writing rather than a succession of meaningful one-line paragraphs. I wanted less heavy-handed symbolism (the book very much centres on troubled father-and-son relationships, to echo the one central Father-and-Son one) and more actual feeling. I wanted a writer (and a translator) who knew better than to call an SS officer 'an SS'. And most of all, I wanted a less abrupt ending. I wanted to ask Wiesel what happened in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of Buchenwald. I wanted to ask him what happened to his leg, on which he marched for several gruesome days just days after having undergone an operation, and how he picked up the pieces afterwards, and why on earth his two eldest sisters, who died in Auschwitz as well as his mother and younger sister, never warranted more than a single mention. The latter was an example of seriously shoddy writing, I thought.Perhaps my questions were answered in the original version of Night, which never got published. In his introduction to the new English translation of Night, Wiesel mentions that the book as it is today is a severely abridged version of a much longer Yiddish original called And the World Remained Silent. I think I can see why the original wasn't published (quite apart from the fact that the world wasn't ready yet for concentration camp literature, the few quotes provided in the introduction make for heavy reading). The abridged version definitely seems more readable than the full-length one, and does an admirable job getting the facts across. Even so, I think the publishers might have gone a step too far in abridging the book to the extent that they did. No doubt the very brevity of Night is one of the reasons why it's so popular today, but personally, I would have liked to see a middle road between the original (detailed) manuscript and the incredibly spare barebones version sold now. Don't get me wrong, the abridged version is effective, but as far as I'm concerned, it's the Holocaust for people with short attention spans. I prefer Primo Levi and Ella Lingens-Reiner's more complete accounts of life in the camps myself, not to mention several Dutch books which sadly never got translated into other languages. But still. Night is an important book, and one that deserves to be widely read. In fact, one that should be widely read, by people of all ages and nationalities, to prevent nightmare like this ever happening again.!121!Un di Velt Hot Geshvign = Night (The Night Trilogy #1), Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel (Translator), François Mauriac (Foreword)""We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.""Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944 to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. Night is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. Testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must simply never be allowed to happen again.تاریخ خوانش روز هشتم ماه مارس سال2018میلادیعنوان: شب؛ نویسنده: الی ویزل؛ مترجم فریده گوینده؛ تهران، نشر لگا، سال1399؛ در133ص؛ شابک9786008987932؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان رومانیا تبار ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20معنوان: شب؛ نویسنده: الی ویزل؛ مترجم احسان قراخانی؛ تهران، میلکان، سال1400؛ در114ص؛ شابک9786222542948؛ الیزر (الی) ویزل، نویسنده، فعال سیاسی، و برنده ی جایزه صلح «نوبل»، و استاد «یهودی»، و از بازماندگان «هولوکاست» بوده است؛ که از سال1998میلادی تا پایان زندگی‌ خویش، سفیر صلح سازمان ملل، در موضوع حقوق بشر بودند؛ «شب» نامدارترین کتاب «الی ویزل» است؛ نویسنده در این کتاب، یادمانهای سرراست خود، از دوران هولناک اردوگاه‌های «نازی» را، بیان می‌کنند؛ این کتاب را نخستین بار خانم «نینا استوار» به فارسی برگردانده‌ است؛ که به کوشش بنیاد جامعه دانشوران، در «ایالات متحده آمریکا» به چاپ رسیده‌ است؛ نویسنده‌ ی کتاب «شب»، «الی ویزل»، هنگامی که همراه مادر، و خواهر و پدرش، از سوی مأموران «اس.اس» پلیس هیتلری دستگیر، و روانه‌ ی کشتارگاه‌های «یهودیان» شد، پانزده سال بیشتر نداشتند؛ بیشتر آن دیگران در اردوگاه‌های «نازی‌» به قتل رسیدند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 09/02/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 19/12/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!5 stars......I am at a loss for words.......upon finishing this memoir, I am so full of intense emotion yet I feel empty at the same time......This is a DEEPLY moving and powerful book about the author's experience in concentration camps and the atrocities that happened during the Holocaust. Words cannot describe how I truly feel about what I read on these pages. It is impossible for us, as readers, to truly fathom this piece of history, unless we lived it. I hope everyone takes the time to read this 120 page memoir at some point in their lives. The author was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 calling him a ""messenger to mankind"" for his written works. We simply cannot risk forgetting.!121!Terrifying. I have read two books that described a nightmare, painted a picture of hell. The second was Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West by Cormac McCarthy and first is Night. I still think of this book sometimes and shudder and I realize that evil is never too far buried in us. The scene where the line of doomed prisoners splits in two with Mengela conducting, a perverse parody of the last judgment seems ripped from Dante.!121!The godsthe godliness of whomdied long agomade you a joke. Did I write it so as not to go mad or, on the contrary, to go mad in order to understand the nature of madness, the immense, terrifying madness that had erupted in history and in the conscience of mankind?-	Elie Wiesel The above-mentioned lines by Elie Wiesel reminds me of what George Orwell said in his essay Why I Write that one would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. The statements by both authors essentially complements each other since it’s inner demon of one which force one to express oneself; and what greater demon could it be than a madness of humanity, one of the slurs on human existence- we famously call as genocide. Amidst the CoVID-19 pandemic, I’ve been trying to pick up books which show bleakness, absurdity, horror and madness of human existence, in this regard Blindness by Jose Saramago presented itself as one of best options. Though I’m still trying to come to terms with Blindness as I’ve yet to reach the core of it; but, one day, my eyes accidentally fell upon Night which has been basking in the dust of laziness and ignorance for a fairly long time. It came upon me that what better occasion could be than right now to expose myself to the testimony of horrendous acts of humanity; in fact such books do not need any occasions at all, for they are for every occasion, as essential as any other treatises. 
Never shall I forget that smoke.Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live.Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned dreams to ashes.Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.Never. 
The eminent sheath of humanity is slurred with many insinuations right from its birth itself, as we gain more experience by our holy sojourn through the grand fabric of time-space, the more defamed we get; and these arduous incidents should discourage the humanity to repeat those but invariably we traverse the same paths which have been trodden before. Perhaps that’s where come our greatest piece of war literature into existence. Having lived through such experiences, one could not keep silent no matter how difficult, if not impossible, it is to speak because an action is the only remedy to indifference. The witness forces himself to testify. For the youth of today, children who will be born tomorrow, he does not want his past to become their future. Having survived such those brazen and unabashed events, the witness needs to give his survival meaning, though he/ she might have braved through circumstances which do not make sense but his/ her account of that survival may certainly impart sense to humanity for its sake. And who better witness could be than Elie Wiesel, for he did complete justice with the role humanity accorded to him. The idea of dying, of ceasing to be, began to fascinate me. To no longer exist. To no longer feel the excruciating pain of my foot. To longer feel anything, neither fatigue nor cold, nothing. To break rank, to let myself slide to the side of the road…. Night shows you excruciating life wherein people of a particular ethnicity no longer hold right to survive, their very existence becomes null and void; and they are reduced to just numbers, and nothing more. They are smoldered in the hell of nothingness, the cries of their unaccomplished existence fall on the deaf ears of the dominant creatures of nether world, who do not resemble human beings, we know them. They are the brave killing machines of a demented and glacial universe where to be inhuman was human, the primordial soup of such universe demands innocent children, helpless women and weary old men as fuel to traverse on the great thread of time-space. Yet, the ironical and revolting part is that such places are from our planet itself; these stomach-churning and disgusting microcosms of life had lived through our glorious but not so distant past. The memories of those still come back from the deep cervices of time and gnaw at us in the present (perhaps would do same in the future) so that we may be ashamed of our deeds in time bygone, so that the very humiliation may demoralize us to repeat our great acts of past.  We had already lived through a lot that night. We thought that nothing could frighten us anymore. But his harsh words sent shivers through us. The word “chimney” here was not as an abstraction; it floated in the air, mingled with the smoke. It was, perhaps, the only word that had a real meaning in this place. I pinched myself: Was I still alive? Was I awake? How was it possible that men, women, and children were being burned and that the world kept silent? No. All this could not be real. A nightmare perhaps….Soon I would wake up with a start, my heart pounding, and find that I was back in the room of my childhood, with my books…In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. If only I could get rid of this dead weight ... Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever."" In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed. ""Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends"", a Kapo tells him. ""Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.”  In unsentimental detail, “Night” recounts daily life in the camps, the never-ending hunger, the sadistic doctors who pulled gold teeth, the Kapos who beat fellow Jews. On his first day in the camps, Wiesel was separated forever from his mother and sister. At Auschwitz, he watched his father slowly succumb to dysentery before the SS beat him to within an inch of his life. Wiesel writes honestly about his guilty relief at his father’s death. In the camps, the formerly observant boy underwent a profound crisis of faith; “Night” was one of the first books to raise the question: where was God at Auschwitz?I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy. I was nothing but ashes now, but I felt myself to be stronger than this Almighty to whom my life had been bound for so long. In the midst of these men assembled for prayer, I felt like an observer, a stranger. Some of us would say that it is concerned with those who have gone through it, those who belong to that specific ethnicity, but that shows their myopic comprehension of humanity only. When human lives are dangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, (caste, in Indian perspective), religion or political views, that place must- at that moment- become the center of the universe. Since human suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere. We see that not only those men, women and children have been targeted but their culture, their religion and traditions have been systematically obliterated so that the very memory of those men/ women may be erased from the history of human civilization. But their reminiscence upsurge from dark pages of the bygone days to rejuvenate their existence, as nature usually do, thanks to courageous people such as Elie Wiesel. Elie Wiesel has written the book with such objectivity that it appears to be an essay which may be applicable to most of the horrendous acts of humanity- be it racism, casteism, misogyny, apartheid or Holocaust. There is so much to be done, even now. We must remember that when our past asks us what we have done with its future and what we have done to make sure that it needs not ask the very question again in future. Elie Wiesel puts it perfectly- As long as one dissident is in prison, or freedom not be true. As long as one child is hungry, our lie will be filled with anguish and shame. . It’s been a while since I read a book which may leave such profound impact on our consciousness as this little beauty by Elie Wiesel does. The language of the book is quite simple but the author and the translator (author’s wife) managed to conjure up vivid and visceral narrative with economy of words. The cries of children, feebleness of their parents and heart wrenching scenes of the Holocaust makes you feel nauseating and bring out all your commiseration, which makes it perhaps a difficult book to be read. It is equally challenging to review the book, for it is quite strenuous task to classify it on the very first place-whether to call it autobiographical novel, memoir or non-fiction. Nonetheless, the book remains as relevant today as it was then and for everyone, irrespective of the fact that how aware you are about these ‘great’ deeds of mankind. For God's sake, where is God?""And from within me, I heard a voice answer:""Where He is ? This is where- hanging here from this gallows...4.75/5!121!From the first few sentences, to the final closings words, I did not move. Elie Wiesel had my complete attention, and total respect, for the immense courage it must have taken to relive the horrors he went through in writing this book. Harrowing and chilling but told with great compassion, his struggle for survival during the holocaust is almost too unbearable to contemplate. But this has to be read, and everyone should do so, it makes all the mundane things in life seem far more important. After the last page was done, I looked out the window of my apartment, up at the sky, down in the street, the noise of the city, the people walking by. The life, the freedom, the hugs, the kisses. What overriding joy.!121!What can I even say about this book. It was powerful and emotional; it was sad and depressing; it was hopeful and optimistic. The first book in the Night Trilogy. Elie Wiesels memoir of his own experiences at various concentration camps. A true story out of one of the worst times in modern history. Seeing the brutality and general disregard for human life that the nazis had, and seeing it through the eyes of 15 year old Eliezer was truly heartbreaking. You can't critique a book like this. It's purely emotional. You'll cry, you'll be angry, you'll cry, you'll be disgusted, and in the end, you'll cry, again. F%#k the Nazis. The best revenge was survival. I hope the next two books in the series are just as good.!121!I teach this book yearly, but my students seemed distant from the true reality of the story. When I use the Holocaust Museum's interactive of Lola Rein's dress, it hits them. Real people, real history. The immediacy of the tragedy that was Wiesel's then comes to life in a way that a junior or senior can grasp. I also tell the story of my friend, Ida, and her ""no grandparents"". That is the hardest part for me as it is so personal. She was the daughter of survivors - she had no grandparents and I gave her mine. The sharing of my friend with my beloved grandmother and grandfather was one of the true blessings of my life and our lives were enriched through the immense addition to our family. I was also blessed by her adding us to her home and her celebrations. My faith was enlarged. This is a powerful book - a simple one to read, but a difficult one to comprehend. Engagingly written and honest to the core - even the difficult, prickly human parts that would embarrass anyone to reveal -- this is the heart of humanity's difficult path - how do we grow if we can't love one another for the similarities and the differences. I wish I could say there was no more genocide, but that would be a dreamer's lie. Bless this with a read and light a candle in our darkness. Also, go and view the dress at the Holocaust Museum website - you will leave changed.!121!To bear witness to a crime so pervasive is to see the abyss...it stares back at you, through your soul, making you question if there is a bottom to the depth of the depravity of mankind. To be able to find light again is amazing - truly one of the most important books on loss and gain we all must weigh and balance - highest recommendation.!121!Όπως αναφέρεται στο επίμετρο αυτού του συγκλονιστικού βιβλίου όταν πρωτοεκδόθηκε το 1956 στην Αργεντινή (στη μητρική γλώσσα του συγγραφέα) είχε τίτλο:«Και ο κόσμος σιωπούσε.....»Θεωρώ πως δεν θα μπορούσε να υπάρξει πιο αντιπροσωπευτικός τίτλος για την ιστορία του βιβλίου αλλά και για την παγκόσμια ανθρώπινη ιστορία. «Η νύχτα» του Ελί Βιζέλ είναι ένα αφηγηματικό ντοκουμέντο για το Ολοκαύτωμα.

Ο ακατανόητος ναζισμός έχει πρωταρχικό σκοπό των αφανισμό των Εβραίων απο πρόσωπου γης. Η ιστορία του βιβλίου αναφέρεται στους Εβραίους της Ουγγαρίας - τελευταία μεγάλη κοινότητα της Ευρώπης- και τον εκτοπισμό της στο Άουσβιτς. Οι ναζί σπαταλούν χρόνο και δυνάμεις για να λυτρώσουν τον κόσμο απο το Κακό. Ένας λυτρωτικός αντισημιτισμός τη στιγμή που ο πόλεμος έχει ουσιαστικά κριθεί εις βάρος τους.

Πρέπει να υπαγορευτεί απο πανάρχαιους θεικούς κανόνες το Καλό;Και στην τελική το Κακό μας συστήνει και μας παραπέμπει στο Καλό, αφού αν δεν κάνουμε αυτό ή εκείνο, απειλούμαστε με αιώνια κόλαση. Το γενικό νόημα του κόσμου με βάση την πνευματική και υλική πρόοδο παραμένει αιώνες αναλλοίωτο. Εν κατακλείδι, οποιαδήποτε απόπειρα αντίδρασης ή επαγρύπνησης πνεύματος και προσωπικότητας ενάντια στις δυνάμεις που πάντα εξουσίαζαν τον κόσμο εκμηδενίζεται και καταστρέφεται. Λαοί ολόκληροι αποδεκατίστηκαν, οι θρησκείες εκκαθάρισαν τον κόσμο. Λαμπρά μυαλά και μεγαλοφυΐες βασανίστηκαν, κάηκαν, κρεμάστηκαν, γδάρθηκαν στο όνομα των αντιδράσεων που μπορούν να λυτρώσουν. Οπότε Νύχτα....Νύχτα...Νύχτα...Βαθύ βελούδινο σκοτάδι. Υπήρχε, υπάρχει και θα υπάρχει. Κι ο κόσμος σιωπούσε....και θα σιωπά. Καλή ανάγνωση. Πολλούς ασπασμούς.!121!Infinitely sad. A book everyone should read.RIP Elie Wiesel.Auschwitz was liberated 75 years ago, during my father's lifetime. It really could happen again, any place, any time. Humanity has it in them, it just needs the right conditions to grow..!121!“Those who kept silent yesterday will remain silent tomorrow.”My first reading of Elie Wiesel's Night occurred during this year's Holocaust Memorial Day.Night is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.Words cannot begin to comprehend the plight of suffering and cruelty revealed in this book that had me on the verge of breaking into sobs page after page, so I'll let the writing speak for itself by sharing moments and passages that cannot be forgotten in time:This here is exactly why I refuse to participate with anything regarding Germany; the world is complicit in its indifference.  “...my hatred remains our only link today.”It pained me beyond words to see my people fall under the “this surely won’t happen to me” spell.And the effect spreads like a snowball, gathering more and more edicts as the days go by.Nothing gets my blood boiling quite like seeing the numerous acts of silence committed by these citizens. People love to victim-blame the Jews by asking the distasteful question of why they didn't stand up to the oppressor... But a more pressing notion, for me, is why those German citizens, watching idly by in the face of atrocity, didn't stand up to their fellow Nazis… ￼￼I was appalled from start to finish with the above. Not only do they watch idly by from a short distance away, but to then FLIRT with them…You think you've reached the peak of cruelty, but then you read on:Experiencing numbness in order to remain sane at the sight of tragedy.This French girl's wisdom has stayed in mind, in particular, because the next paragraph describes an out-of-this-world experience wherein Elie Wiesel stumbles upon her eons later:But the most painful of all remains to be the relationship portrayed between father and son that keeps both alive in the face of inhumanity.Many more sorrowful revelations are shared within the pages of this must-read. Elie Wiesel's raw written voice commemorates all that must never be forgotten.My arms gathered with goosebumps at that because the date I was reading this book was April 11th.I'll end this review by sharing my favorite Elie Wiesel quote:“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.”

This review and more can be found on my blog.!121!UpdateIntrigued by the success and popularity of this book, as opposed to more factual holocaust memoirs, I did a little research on the history of the book, and I came across an interesting article on Wikipedia. According to the information contained in this article, Wiesel moved to Paris after the war and in 1954 completed an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish about his experiences, published in Argentina in 1956 as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign (""And the World Remained Silent"")It is unclear who edited the text for publication. Wiesel wrote in All Rivers Run to the Sea (1995) that he handed Turkov, a publisher of Yiddish texts, his only copy and that it was never returned, but also that he (Wiesel) ""cut down the original manuscript from 862 pages to the 245 of the published Yiddish edition.""Wiesel translated Un di Velt Hot Geshvign into French and sent it to François Mauriac. Even with Mauriac's help they had difficulty finding a publisher; Wiesel said they found it too morbid. The text was edited down to 178 pages and published as La Nuit, with a preface by François Mauriac. Wiesel's New York agent, encountered the same difficulty finding a publisher in the United States. In 1960, Hill & Wang in New York published an even smaller 116-page English translation as Night. It took three years to sell the first print run of 3,000 copies. By 1997 Night was selling 300,000 copies a year in the United States. By 2011 it had sold six million copies in that country, and was available in 30 languages. Sales increased in January 2006 when it was chosen for Oprah’s Book Club. Republished with a new translation by Marion Wiesel, Wiesel's wife, and a new preface by Wiesel, it sat at no. 1 in The New York Times bestseller list for paperback non-fiction for 18 months from 13 February 2006, until the newspaper decided to remove it. Literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that Night's impact stems from its minimalist construction. The 1956 Yiddish version, at 865 pages, was a long and angry historical work. In preparation for the French edition, Wiesel's editors pruned without mercy. Franklin argues that the power of the narrative was achieved at the cost of literal truth, and that to insist that the work is purely factual is to ignore its literary sophistication. Holocaust scholar Lawrence Langer argues similarly that Wiesel evokes, rather than describes: ""Wiesel's account is ballasted with the freight of fiction: scenic organization, characterization through dialogue, periodic climaxes, elimination of superfluous or repetitive episodes, and especially an ability to arouse the empathy of his readers, which is an elusive ideal of the writer bound by fidelity to fact.""In a comparative analysis of the Yiddish and French texts, Naomi Seidman, professor of Jewish culture, concludes that there are two survivors in Wiesel's writing, a Yiddish and French. In re-writing rather than simply translating Un di Velt Hot Geshvign, Wiesel replaced an angry survivor who regards ""testimony as a refutation of what the Nazis did to the Jews,"" with one ""haunted by death, whose primary complaint is directed against God ..."". Night transformed the Holocaust into a religious event.Seidman argues that the Yiddish version was for Jewish readers, who wanted to hear about revenge, but the anger was removed for the largely Christian readership of the French translation. In the Yiddish edition, for example, when Buchenwald was liberated: ""Early the next day Jewish boys ran off to Weimar to steal clothing and potatoes. And to rape German shiksas [un tsu fargvaldikn daytshe shikses]."" In the 1958 French and 1960 English editions: ""On the following morning, some of the young men went to Weimar to get some potatoes and clothes—and to sleep with girls [coucher avec des filles]. But of revenge, not a sign.""Here’s a similar article in the NYTimes: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/bo...Original review'Night' was a good read, but I expected a lot more. The reason I gave 'Night' only 3 stars, is because compared to the other holocaust memoirs I've read so far, I thought this was the weakest. I gave 5 to 'If this is a man' (Survival in Auschwitz) by Primo Levi and to 'Five Chimneys' by Olga Lengyel, These memoirs were far superior to Mr. Wiesel's. To 'Fatelessness' by Imre Kertész, I gave 4 stars. Those memoirs gave more detailed, day-to-day descriptions of how it was to live in the camps. Don't get me wrong, it's not voyeurism I'm searching for in those memoirs. But sitting on my sofa, or in the sun, and never experienced a war or genocide except on television or in the newspaper, I simply can't imagine what life was like in the concentration camps. And I simply want to know the truth. I think Mr. Wiesel's testimony fails to give the reader a full understanding of that experience. While reading Primo Levi, I nearly lived with him in the camp, felt his cold, his starvation, his exhaustion, the diseases, the mud, the pests...I did not experience this when I was reading 'Night'. But I have to admit that the last part of the book touched me very deeply. That was the part about the death marches, and about Elie's poor father. I also wondered why he didn't write anything about the rest of his family? What happened to them?Mr. Wiesel was only 15 at the time, but already very devout. His experience caused a strong struggle with his faith, and he writes about that battle with God quite often. Of course, that religious conflict doesn't resonate with everyone. Worse, I couldn't believe this when I read it :""Yom Kippur. The day of Atonement. Should we fast? The question was hotly debated. To fast could mean a more certain, more rapid death. In this place, we were always fasting. It was Yom Kippur year-round. But there were those who said we should fast, precisely because it was dangerous to do so. We needed to show God that even here, locked in hell, we were capable of singing His praises.""!121!Night is Elie Wiesel's memoir about his experiences during the Holocaust. It is shocking and sad, but worth reading because of the power of Wiesel's witnessing one of humanity's darkest chapters and his confession on how it changed him.In the new introduction to the ebook version I read, Wiesel talked about the difficulty he had putting words to his experience. ""Convinced that this period in history would be judged one day, I knew that I must bear witness. I also knew that, while I had many things to say, I did not have the words to say them."" pg. 7, introductionThe original version of Night was written in Yiddish. I wish I knew enough Yiddish to read it. There's something powerful about reading books in their original form.Wiesel closes his introduction with his reasons for writing this book: ""For the survivor who chooses to testify, it is clear: his duty is to bear witness for the dead and for the living. He has no right to deprive future generations of a past that belongs to our collective memory. To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time."" pg 12, introduction.Even though a member of his community warned Wiesel's village about the horrors that awaited them, they didn't believe him. After they were placed in a ghetto, the Jewish population of Sighet thought that the worst was behind them. ""Most people thought that we would remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Afterward everything would be as before. The ghetto was ruled by neither German nor Jew; it was ruled by delusion."" pg 26, ebook.If I had been in their place, I don't think that I would have acted any differently. How could one possibly imagine the horrors that they were going to face?Wiesel is starved, overworked and beaten in the concentration camps. He loses more than his family and faith: ""One day when I was able to get up, I decided to look at myself in the mirror on the opposite wall. I had not seen myself since the ghetto. From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me."" pgs 110-111 ebook.Another Holocaust survivor's memoir that I highly recommend is Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. Never forget.!121!I remember that I first became aware of this story when it was put on the Oprah book club list years ago..I’ve always meant to read it since then.We read all these novels based on the Holocaust and they are really tough to read, but these first hand personal experiences are so brutal and unimaginable.Ellie was only 15 when he and his family where taken away to the camps. I really can’t say more then others have said in their reviews, but.. just read it.. or listen, this audio was good!Excerpt from NightNever shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.—Elie Wiesel, from Night!121!''The night had passed completely. The morning star shone in the sky. I too had become a different person. The student of Talmud, the child I was, had been consumed by the flames. All that was left was a shape that resembled me. My soul had been invaded—and devoured—by a black flame.''Beautiful and devastating work. I applaud Elie Wiesel for having the courage to describe traumatic experiences in such an intimate and honest way, not shying away from the dark part of human nature that can come through in such inhumane circumstances. Description of the relationship with his father during the imprisonment has great psychological depth, and it felt like this was something deeply personal, that person would be able to say only to a confidant. The level of consciousness of Elie's processes in psyche and spirit at such a young age amazes me. He describes the anger, the loss of faith, the despair and estrangement painfully accurately. ''I no longer pleaded for anything. I was no longer able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy. I was nothing but ashes now, but I felt myself to be stronger than this Almighty to whom my life had been bound for so long. In the midst of these men assembled for prayer, I felt like an observer, a stranger.''It reminded me of the first part of Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, which is a great compliment to Wiesel, concerning the fact Frankl was a grown man, a doctor and a psychiatrist during the time of imprisonment. In comparison to Frankl's work, the writing has less emotional warmth and is more direct, which I think reflects greatly the mechanisms of defense through dissociation, often seen in trauma, especially at a young age.  ''The absent no longer entered our thoughts. One spoke of them—who knows what happened to them?—but their fate was not on our minds. We were incapable of thinking. Our senses were numbed, everything was fading into a fog. We no longer clung to anything. The instincts of self-preservation, of self-defense, of pride, had all deserted us. In one terrifying moment of lucidity, I thought of us as damned souls wandering through the void, souls condemned to wander through space until the end of time, seeking redemption, seeking oblivion, without any hope of finding either.''I've read that there is great work also from Primo Levi about the experience of concentration camps that I want to read in the future. I don't know why, but I find writing about the experiences of concentration camps hypnotic, when I start reading about it I can't stop, no matter the level of emotional distress it produces in me. It is both deeply tragic and encouraging - seeing people going through hell on earth and still prevailing, still maintaining and even growing spiritual and psychological strength. I still remember the deep impact Man's search for meaning had on me, truly life-changing. Night maybe does not have such evident silver lining as Man’s search for meaning, but I found it equally cathartic. Both Wiesel and Frankl are immense gifts for humanity, and it breaks my heart when to think about how many voices perished because of the horrors of the Holocaust. Their experience isn't just personal, they made it universal, transpersonal, and transcendental in their writing with healing potential, showing the path of light exists even in the darkest ages.!121!Night is perhaps one of the most remarkable, harrowing and haunting accounts of the events in the Nazi Germany concentration camps Auschwitz and Buchenwald. I read this powerful work only a few days before news of the author's, Elie Wiesel's, death were announced, and both shocked me. The first, because unless you have experienced it for yourself, you will never be able to realize the full extent of what happened in the Second World War with all its different facets and emotions, and the latter, because with Elie Wiesel, a remarkable man has left this planet who fought for memorizing the Holocaust, who fought against violence, suppression and racism.Perhaps you will not find the most eloquent, the most artful language in this work of literature, but that's nothing you should expect to find in a book dealing with something as frightening, as horrifying, as real as the Holocaust. In his nonfictional book, Elie Wiesel writes about his own survival in the concentration camps, about reflections of the father-son relationship with his father, about humanity and inhumanity. It's a book everyone should read, because ultimately, the Second World War is something everyone should remember. Forgetting would be the worst way to deal with it.A lot of people, more people than would be good, claim that it has all been ""so long ago"", is so completely irrelevant nowadays, just belongs to this boring stuff people are tortured with in school because it belongs to this dry nonsense called ""history"". I usually don't tell people they're wrong ... usually. Because in this case, they can't be more wrong. The Holocaust needs to be remembered, because if humans forget the mistakes they did, they will tend to repeat them. And I think everyone can agree that the Holocaust should never, never be repeated.This is a book which is incredibly difficult to review, just like it is difficult to read - not for its language or its style; I read it in one sitting in the course of three or four hours - but rather for the horrifying events Elie Wiesel talks about. I can only recommend to read this book to everyone, independent from how much you already know about the topic.And on a final note: Rest in Peace, Elie Wiesel.!121!I read this book once beforebut read it again yesterday---with the new preface by his wife Marion Wiesel. I did not plan on reading the whole thing--I just wanted to read the new Preface---but then while sitting around (with sick people in the house)--I just dived into the horror again.....(with expanded thoughts than in years pass).!121!there are simply no words which i could write that would do this book the justice it deserves. i am speechless.

Into the Wild (Kindle Edition),Jon Krakauer,4.01,1084505,1996,"Krakauer’s page-turning bestseller explores a famed missing person mystery while unraveling the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons.""Terrifying... Eloquent... A heart-rending drama of human yearning."" —New York TimesIn April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. How Christopher Johnson McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the drives and desires that propelled McCandless. When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, Into the Wild is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page.","My grandfather--not an Alaskan but an experienced outdoorsman--would have tied this kid to a tree and let the bears play tetherball with him.A small part of me appreciates the effort Krakauer put into researching this book. A much bigger part of me is completely disgusted both with McCandless himself and with Krakauer's mindless adoration of him. Krakauer pulls out all the stops to make McCandless look like a phenomenon, and seems to agree with McCandless that the world should have handed itself to him on a silver salver because he was just so darned special. We're told he was brilliant, independent, funny, kind, musical, athletic, visionary, talented. Can you see the halo? Unfortunately, the impression that comes across is of a snotty adolescent who has never seriously thought of anyone but himself and is used to getting by on charm and flippancy rather than making good use of his considerable gifts (and I do not doubt that he was gifted). The conflicting aspects of his personality don't sound quirky; they sound devious and self-serving.Krakauer tries half-heartedly to disguise his fascination but his admissions that McCandless was a clueless young hothead sound insincere; he has to say it to sound credible to his readers, who are less smitten. Krakauer makes an apt comparison between himself as an idealistic and foolhardy young man, and McCandless, and then dismisses himself because ""he didn't have [McCandless':] intellect"". This sounds utterly bogus after all we have been told about McCandless' foolish mistakes, and the obvious fact that Krakauer is not stupid. Two chapters that could have provided some insight into his hero are wasted because Krakauer sounds like a religious fanatic, with McCandless as his unknowable God and Krakauer as the I'm-not-worthy follower.McCandless' (and Everett Ruess') overconfidence speaks to a fascination with nature but not a respect for it. Courage is not the same as not knowing when we ought to have a healthy degree of fear. Instead, McCandless arrogantly drives his car into the habitat of an endangered species of poppy. He butchers a moose, wasting the life of a beautiful and well-adapted animal because he could not be bothered to learn ahead of time how to preserve it.This was not a tragedy; this was inevitable. I don't believe he was schizophrenic or suicidal. Bipolar or ADD, maybe. His own friends readily admitted that he had a lot of enthusiasm but little common sense and didn't know much outside of academia. There are so many glaring outdoorsmanship errors made in the first two chapter that even I was cringing.I write this with full admission that I am not much of an outdoorsperson. However, I don't believe for a minute that he lasted longer than most of us would have, or that ""at least he tried it"", as so many of his fans insist. I wouldn't try it, not because I'm scared, but because I can tell from here that ten pounds of rice and no preparation is a recipe for failure. I don't need to try it, and if I did, I'd want to live to get something out of it. Lots of other people have gone into the wilderness and come out just fine because they knew the magnitude of their own insignificance and planned ahead.I'm not jealous of his alleged brilliance, either. I was accepted to Emory. And the University of Chicago. And a couple of other amply respected schools. Lots of people are. Big deal.1) His bourgeois status made his adventure possible in the first place. He had money to pay his college tuition; the rest of us graduated and went to work to pay off our loans. He also had the gall to complain about his parents' offers to help him out, which smacks of a kid given so much that he doesn't know how fortunate he is.Furthermore, living with nothing by choice is very different from living with nothing because you have no alternative. Though I'm sure he would have denied it, McCandless had the option of going back to his affluent life if he had wanted to, or if he had had to in an emergency. Maybe it would have knocked his self-image for a loop, but he would have been sheltered, fed, and nursed back to health. A lot of people live in poverty without that safety net. 2) Now is not the time to be squeamish about killing animals. Hint: There are no vegetarian Aleut. This guy was a history and anthropology major. I learned in anthro that you can eat plants and lean protein until you burst and still starve to death if you aren't getting enough calories. It's very difficult to feed yourself if you're alone and don't have a lot of practice at it.3) If he got this idea from Thoreau and London, he wasn't reading very carefully. McCandless should have read less Thoreau and more Donner Party. London's Alaskan experience was during the Klondike Gold Rush when he had plenty of help from others. Thoreau lived in a cabin on the edge of town, a mile and a half from the family home. He was not in the wilderness. Furthermore, Thoreau's civil disobedience was a protest against the Mexican War and slavery, not a petty defiance of matters of public safety such as mandatory car insurance. McCandless was a rebel without a cause.4) Book-smart can't save you now. Success-only learning does not work. Krakauer goes into raptures about McCandless' education and intelligence to demonstrate the supposed tragedy of his loss. Nice brain gymnastics, but apples to oranges when what you need is practical knowledge.This guy was idolized by some my college classmates, most of whom were sheltered, relatively wealthy urbanites. They had the same vague and pathetic need for ""real"" experiences and arrogant expectation of success that comes from never having failed at anything in their lives.5) For most of his trip, McCandless was neither independent or self-reliant. He got lost in Mexico; it would have been more self-reliant to get a map and take charge of his own navigation. He didn't eat for days until somebody felt sorry for him and fed him. Once he was in a situation where there was nobody to step in for him, he died (in this respect, I disagree with Krakauer that McCandless was any different from Carl McCunn). Even at that point, he left a note on the door of the bus begging for rescue.The best (and most independent) outdoorsmen spend years learning. Just because you were a superstar student and athlete doesn't mean you get to skip all the hard work. I've no doubt that McCandless was smart, but he was mind-bogglingly ignorant and inexperienced.6) Why are these self-discovery escapades always so self-centered? How about joining the Peace Corps? Teaching in inner-city schools? Working in healthcare in a remote South Asian village? If you're so disgusted with society, why don't you do something to improve it rather than keeping all the enlightenment for yourself?7) Nature is not your babysitter. Nature doesn't care if you live or die. It's survival of the fittest, and humans, compared to most animals, are slow, weak, poorly-armed, poorly-insulated, have no stamina; have poor senses of smell, eyesight, and hearing; and are ill-adapted to go without clean water and food for any length of time. We are clearly meant to live in groups and use tools. This guy didn't even bring an ax.8) He was already controlled and tainted by society or else he would not have worked so hard to avoid it. His anti-society and anti-materialism were as controlling of him as is the materialism of those who think they can ""find themselves"" by buying the right clothes or drug habit or SUV.9) Unprepared people who set out on ill-planned ""adventures"" and need to be rescued are jackasses. A lot of other people–-better-prepared, better-trained, and more sensible people such as park service, volunteers, and EMT's–-end up spending a lot of time and money, and risking their own necks, to save them. McCandless spared everyone that trouble, but I'm sure there's a whole line of wannabes lined up to try it. I hope they have to pay back every penny spent on their rescues.And Truth? The bad news is that Truth is relative. It doesn't exist in a vacuum. What a waste.!121!This book is a wonderful cautionary tale. I will probably read it again with my daughter when she is old enough to discuss it. Unfortunately, I'm afraid the reason most people will read the book and see the new upcoming movie, is for a different reason. Chris McCandless (in the book, and from what I understand in the movie), is a hero and courageous for flying in the face of everything he grew up with to find a better way. A young man unhappy with the materialism, hunger, and waste in the world; angry with his father for not being a perfect father to him; intellectually superior, a fantastic athlete in top condition... and yet a young man who died because of his own decisions and his own actions. He cut off ties to his family, hitchhiked and worked his way to Alaska, headed ""into the wild"" in April 1992, and was found dead in August 1992 most probably from starvation. How wonderful to ""fight against the odds"" and ""ask real questions"". Unfortunately, Chris didn't really fight against any odds, he took the easy way out by cutting off real relationships. Chris may have asked real questions, but he denied real people the opportunity to answer them in any way, because he had already decided what was ""the right way"". This is not heroic. It is immaturity. It is tragic and sad, yes, but not heroic or courageous.After reading the book, I think Chris died because he was foolish. Intellectually bright, yes. Athletically gifted, yes. But he had no wisdom. Wisdom has been defined as ""skill in living"", and wisdom is not always bestowed on the young and the healthy and the intellectually smart. The opposite of wisdom is foolishness. His anger and questioning drove him not to wisdom, but to self-reliance and an overweening arrogance in his own ability to ""get through it"". Well, we see the result of those decisions and those attitudes.... to quote Darwin, Chris is an example of how ""survival of the fittest"" applies. Chris was not ""fit"", therefore he did not ""survive"". But why wasn't he fit? He was smart and young and gifted in many ways, but he chose to abandon relationships and abandon those who loved him and create himself anew with no relationships and no ties. He walked away from people who loved him, made friends with people who came to love him, and walked away from all of that to find his answers ""in the wild"" on his own. The way away from love and relationship leads not to life, but indeed to death. And death is what Chris got.The book quotes Chris' mother as saying, ""I haven't prayed since we lost him."" (pg. 202) An older man who befriended Chris, Ronald Franz, also says, ""When Alex left for Alaska, I prayed. I asked God to keep his finger on the shoulder of that one; I told him that boy was special. But he let Alex die. So on December 26, when I learned what had happened, I renounced the Lord. I withdrew my church membership and became an atheist. I decided I couldn't believe in a God who would let something that terrible happen to a boy like Alex."" (pg. 60) But God didn't do anything to Chris, except let him do as he wanted? If Chris sought real answers to his hard questions, God is there, and God can help, but you have to know you need help and submit to someone wiser than you. Chris McCandless never submitted willingly to anyone, and he certainly never admitted anyone else had teaching or wisdom for him. He was smarter than everyone else, better able to see the truth than anyone else. So the heritage Chris McCandless left is one that drives his mother to stop praying, and converts an old man to atheism. Is this the heritage anyone would want?So read this book, but read it with questions in mind. Why are we lauding a young man as a hero who was actually a foolish man? What kind of society are we in where real courage and real heroism are somehow playing 2nd fiddle to selfishness and arrogance? When are you so intellectually intelligent that you become stupid? Is there any time when foolish decisions could be called ""courageous""? In a search for truth and what really matters in life, is it acceptable to think nothing of hurting those people who are most vulnerable to you? When you die, will the way you lived your life cause others to abandon their faith or grow in their faith? Is it ever courageous to be selfish and think only of yourself? Is it harder to walk away from a relationship, or to stay in a relationship and work on making it better? Would you ever teach anyone else that the way to have real relationships is to limit yourself only to those people who cannot ever hurt you?Real courage, real heroism comes when you love others and you serve others. Real courage has nothing selfish in it. Fathers and husbands who remain with their families and provide for them, even though they would rather have a mid-life crisis and leave it all, they are courageous and heroic. They remain, they work, they don't father or husband perfectly, but they remain in difficult relationships. It courageous to stay in the hard parts of life, and try. Mothers and wives who sacrifice and serve again and again and again without books being written about them, without thanks, but who continue to love and give of themselves to others. That is courageous. It is hard to stay in messy relationships. It is easy to leave. It is courageous to stay and do hard things. It is easy to leave and do what you want.So, let's read this book, but read it as a cautionary tale. This is what happens when you seemingly 'have it all', but have not love. When you die, will people be driven to become atheists? Will people stop praying when you are dead? Or will you live a life of wisdom and love? Will you leave behind you a heritage of godly love and service? Will people pray more because of the example you left them? Will they be more loving, better mothers or fathers or sisters or brothers? Or will they become angry and arrogant and foolishness? Yes, this is a good book to read. But let's read it for the right reasons and with the right questions.[NOTE: In the book, and in the movie, the author proposes that Chris ate some poison berries which caused his death. But tests have been made around the area, and plants that would have been available to Chris were tested, and no toxic berries or plants have been found. The truth is probably that he starved. Too few calories coming in, high expenditure of calories for hunting and keeping warm resulted eventually in such a calorie deficit that he died.] Some good articles I found on Chris McCandless include:http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/ap...http://nmge.gmu.edu/textandcommunity/...Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: “I am exposed continually to what I will call the ‘McCandless Phenomenon.’ People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent […:] When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn’t even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he [had:] had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament […:] Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.”[18:] Some may argue that this is what he wanted all along, given his troubled past****************An update as of Sept 2013 as to how McCandless died. See http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs... which documents the poison contained in wild potato seeds. Consuming these seeds introduces a neurotoxin into the body which results in lathyrism. This condition causes gradual paralysis which ultimately made McCandless very weak, unable to stand or walk, and thus unable to forage or hunt for food.!121!""I now walk into the wild.""- Christopher McCandless (1968-1992)I live a life, I suspect, that is much like yours. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, go to bed. At the end of this weekly desert, there might be a drink or ten to celebrate the victory over another five days of soul-crushing drudgery.I am a desk jockey. A paper pusher. I mean that literally; I sit in my office, and when people peer inside, they will see me moving a sheet of paper from one side to the other. It looks, to the untrained eye, like valuable labor. When I get the chance, though, I head to the mountains, to the wild. I love the away-ness of these trips. At the risk of sounding absurdly curmudgeonly, I like getting away from the crush of humanity (and I'm sure the crush of humanity appreciates my temporary absence). There was at time when my friends and I would head out west every summer. We picked a destination (isolated, challenging), packed the car, and plunged into the wilderness. We undertook silly risks, because we were younger and we laughed at consequences, or at the possibility that there were consequences. Once, a little later on, we gathered around a campfire, four of us, and swore - like characters from a young adult novel - that we'd always do this: that we'd always head out to the mountains together. Then we got older. My friends married, they started having kids, and the mountains became a memory, a slideshow of pictures that showed up on the screen savers of our computers. Friends with whom I'd jumped off cliffs, slid down glaciers, and climbed rocks matured overnight into sober professionals, husbands, and fathers. It was remarkable how age engendered caution, and squelched the desire for adventure. That was my mindset when I picked up Into the Wild. Jon Krakauer's classic is, to put it mildly, a polarizing book. Based on the people I've surveyed, I've found that you either love it or you hate it, and whether you love it or hate it will be determined by what you think about Christopher McCandless, the young man at the center of Into the Wild. You will be taken in by Chris's literate, philosophical, iconoclastic, boundary-pushing vagabondism. Or you will be sickened by his selfishness, his self-pity, and the way he left a shattered family in his wake. Either way, you will have a vivid response.Upon graduating from Emory University, and instead of going on to law school (which was my choice), McCandless gave away $25,000 to charity and began his life as a tramp (or hobo, as they sometimes like to be called). I was in sixth grade when McCandless walked into the Alaskan wilderness and never returned. He was 24. The power of Into the Wild is directly attributable to Krakauer's empathy for his subject. Krakauer is a solid adventure writer, but he's not a prose stylist. Rather, he uses his own life experiences to connect with Chris on a very intimate, personal level. He does not attempt any faux objectivity that is often the hallmark of ""serious"" serious journalism. Instead, Krakauer admits, straight up, that he saw his younger self in Chris, with the exception that Krakauer survived his youth, while Chris did not. For instance, there is an autobiographical section in Into the Wild where Krakauer tells his story about climbing the Devil's Thumb. This could easily have been a self-serving digression, but Krakauer uses that experience, and the vividness of his memory, to explore the the compulsions that drove Chris McCandless to follow his unique path to his destiny. I think Chris, in his own way, was a towering figure; he was the person I would like to be, if I had more guts and less excuses. He was a smart kid, a college grad, who came from money. His parents were messed up, but really, whose parents aren't? After college, instead of going to law school (don't go to law school, by the way), he gave away $25,000, burned his credit cards, and set out to see the west. Whatever else you call him, you can't call him a poser. Like everyone, he had his share of dreams and demons, and he set out to follow his dreams and fight his demons. There's something to be said for what he put his parent through. Still, the world forces us to be our own person. He went forward the best way he knew how, defining himself along the way. The tragedy, of course, is that the lessons he learned - about the value of friends and family - he learned too late. I don't really need to defend Chris. Krakauer does that. He is unabashedly in his corner, defending his choices, his skills, his desire to go alone to the far places, like John Muir before him. Chris McCandless was himself, fully and completely, which is saying a lot, in this day and age. Or any day and age. He was part adventurer, part philosopher, and part monk (the monk part fascinates Krakauer, who spends a lot of time wondering whether Chris died a virgin). I suppose a brief note on the movie, directed by Sean Penn, is in order. While I found it poetic and inspiring, the movie focuses too much on Chris's effect on the various people he meets on his journeys. In a way, Chris becomes some kind of wandering apostle, healing and helping those he meets along his path, before he dies a martyr's death in Alaska, a vision from a Don Maclean song (""the world was never meant for one as beautiful as you...""). The book, on the other hand, keeps Chris firmly grounded as a human being. Krakauer admires Chris, to be sure, but he does not neglect the warts. (However, Krakauer sharply dismisses those armchair psychiatrists who want to diagnose Chris with a mental disorder. I'm glad he does. I think it's saying soemething about the conformity of our society that anyone who bucks the trend (he gave up law school!?) is called mad). In the end, Chris was one of those rare people who wanted to know the world intimately, and in the process of discovering those secrets, was killed by that same world. Maybe there was something quixotic or foolish in his quest; maybe he should have taken a job, taken a wife, found a safe desk behind which to grow old. Or maybe there is something foolish in us, to believe that we can outlive the world with our caution.!121!okay. lets address the elephant on goodreads, which is the common theme of essentially bashing chris mccandless in reviews. i have seen so many ranting about how irresponsible and selfish and arrogant and unprepared he was. and i mean, theyre not wrong, but that honestly has nothing to do with the book? what i love most about this is how objective krakauer is. he neither praises nor critiques mccandless, but presents the facts regarding an unfortunate event in a very interesting and fascinating way. which leads me to believe that many people did not understand the nature of this book.yes, mccandless thought so highly of himself that he literally went out into the alaskan wilderness, equipped with only a plant guide, and felt confident that he could survive. yes, he ignored the number one rule of boys scouts - to be prepared. yes, he only thought about how his actions affected himself. but man, the manner in which krakauer tells chris' story is so gripping that i couldnt help but get invested in everything that happened. this book reads like a true crime story, but where the only crime committed was a serious lack of judgement by a very misguided individual. so it seems massively unfair to penalise the book itself because of disagreeing with what a young man did. but hey, to each their own. ↠ 4 stars!121!Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this book. The genesis of the book was an in-depth magazine article, and I suspect that the article was superb. But I just don't think there's enough here to warrant an entire book. As evidence, I point to several lengthy chapters that have nothing to do with the underlying story--they discuss other people who have gone ""into the wild"" and, surprisingly, Krakauer includes a whole chapter about himself.My other problem is that I found myself unable to identify or empathize with the central character here. I think that Chris McCandless was not much more than a privileged, entitled, selfish, and undeniably intelligent person who threw everything away and nearly destroyed his family for reasons that weren't any clearer by the end of the book than they were at the beginning. I worried far more about his parents and his sister, who he called his ""best friend,"" than I did about him.I ended up ""finishing"" the book by skimming the last 1/3, or maybe even the last 1/2. I almost gave this only 1 star but decided to go with 2 because I want to give Krakauer the benefit of the doubt--it's a well-written book, I just don't think it needed to be written at all.!121!In 1992, roughly around the same time Chris McCandless was living out his final days in the Alaskan wilderness, I would have been enjoying the summer holidays before embarking on my final year at school, contemplating the big wide world and what I was going to do with the rest of my life. It wasn't until watching Sean Penn's film in 2008 I would learn of Chris's story, a story that moved me, immensely.I always presumed Jon Krakauer's book would be some huge epic, but was surprised on finding out it's a little over 200 pages. I simply had to read it, just don't know why it took me so long. It's going to be difficult to review this without making my own thoughts on Chris known first. Although it isn't as straightforward as this, taking everything into consideration, if there is to be a camp criticism and a camp McCandless, then I firmly sit with McCandless. He was an awe-inspiring bright young man, who simply broke free from the establishment to follow his own path, a path, going by both book and film that was simply stunning. I know there are people that criticized his adventure as reckless, stupid, dangerous and well unequipped for the treacherous landscape of wild Alaska, and were even angry with him, that he deserved what was coming to him, disrespecting nature. Let's not forget something, he probably died a slow agonizing death that you wouldn't wish on anybody, why the anger from people who didn't even know him? it was nobody else's business what Chris chose to undertake. As the old saying goes, it's a free country. And he was just that, free.I do feel for his family of course, I can't begin to imagine the pain and anguish they would have had to injure, and the fact he didn't try to contact his sister Karine, who he was dearly close to, was strange. I just hope his family came to eventually realize that the two years Chris spent on the road he would have been immensely happy. That's got to count for something. Had he gone on to work, no doubt well paid work, you get the impression he just wouldn't want to be there. Had Chris been some wacko or mentally incapacitated person I would have taken far more pity over his story, but he wasn't, he was highly intelligent and knew exactly what he was doing. That's why, although he came to a sad end, I am still on the whole, happy for the guy.The strongest parts of the book for me are actually not the last months in Alaska (which had to be recreated based on Chris’ diary and the evidence found at the site of his death), but the memories of people whom Chris had met on his travels, with whom he had caught rides, worked and stayed, struck up friendships. I was especially moved by the generosity of strangers and by Chris’s run in with 81 year old Ron Franz, whom he managed to convince to give up the monotonous life and take up adventure. These two years of traveling had no boundaries, no obligations, no limitations, no expectations. Just exploring the land, exploring life, and himself. Jon Krakauer also included memories from his own youth, trying to draw comparisons with Chris, along with some other historical journey's similar to what McCandless embarked on. Chris was a keen reader, and used literature as a way to inspire him on the road, there were quotes from the likes of Leo Tolstoy, Jack London, Henry David Thoreau and Wallace Stegner that he noted down in his diary, these play an important role for any outsider trying to understand just who Chris was.The book works wonders on different levels, it deals with non fiction in a dramatic storytelling way, like an adventure novel, but also stays as close as possible to the facts and truths recovered from Chris's diary. I didn't think his epic story could be condensed down to 200 pages, but it works, only concentrating on the things that truly matter. I was moved to the core. Not many books have had the opportunity to do this to me.One shouldn’t judge a life by its end or its duration, but by its content. Chris may have died young, but his life certainly was a fulfilling one.!121!The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure.
Christopher Johnson McCandless began roaming in 1991 after graduating college. He gave away his savings ($25,000) to charity, got rid of all his material possessions, burned his remaining money and just left. 
Don't settle down and sit in one place. Move around, be nomadic, make each day a new horizon.
He didn't tell anyone where he was going, what he was doing - just up and left, leaving a stunned sister and confused family behind.Like his favorite heroes, he set off for an adventure. Eventually he left behind his car in the Mojave Desert and lived under an assumed name, Alexander Supertramp.
It's not always necessary to be strong, but to feel strong.
He kept his journals with him, he worked when hungry and slowly, but surely, made his way to the Alaskan wilderness.Along the way he met many a wonderful person - of which he touched their lives and even months later, they remembered and knew of him.
“Happiness [is] only real when shared”
But, what's shocking most of all is how he was found.Alone. Emaciated. Dead. His story has captured the hearts and minds of millions, he is gone but he will be remembered.
When you forgive, you love. And when you love, God’s light shines upon you. 
Whew.There's a lot to unpack here. I have never read this book, I have never seen the movie but I know his story.I remember my mom telling me parts when I was a child, my teachers filling me in during history lessons and even friends talk about this unforgettable book.So, when it became available at the library, I had to check it out. And wow. I really didn't know what to expect (and this certainly wasn't what I thought I was going to read) and yet, it was perfect.This was told through a third party - someone who read about McCandless's story back when it was a minor blurb in a newspaper and was curious where it began. So, the author picked up the thread and followed it - eventually reconstructing the year before McCandless's death and the reason behind him leaving everything behind. This book was so well-written. It completely encapsulated this young man's life and death. This is one of those books that once you finish it, you are spoiled for everything else for a long, long time.
Sometimes he tried too hard to make sense of the world, to figure out why people were bad to each other so often.
YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!Chris McCandless didn't want to prove anything to anyone; he just wanted to be free and live as he saw fit. So far, from the image of the bohemian and thoughtless teenager, Jon Krakauer portrays him to us as an intelligent and obstinate young man with remarkable capacities to unite around him. He leaves those who have met him during his travels this feeling of great sociability, which contrasts significantly with the need for solitude that he regularly showed, a little the desire to owe nothing to anyone and find the solutions to his problems.When he leaves his family at a young age after high school, he goes from odd jobs to odd jobs, squats where the wind carries him, and fate brings him down. He must have had a lucky star because his meetings always seem benevolent, and this is perhaps one of the elements that will encourage him to push his adventures even further. His thirst for self-sufficiency will guide him to Alaska in a desert, where he will spend several months with the fatal outcome we know.The author breaks stereotypes and does a real investigation work by understanding this young man's personality, who wishes to break with modern life. Far from judgment and bias, he analyzes the situation by comparing it to other life paths similar to Chris McCandless. It also seems that his death is still a little enigmatic because many news sites on the subject are always looking for genuine reasons.That's a genuine interest in this book, which brings us back tirelessly to the harsh reality of life outside civilization.!121!I love Jon Krakauer. I didn't find one single thing about the Alex McCandless even remotely interesting. He came across as a spoiled brat with no concept of reality - basically because of his priveleged upbringing. But somehow, he blamed his parents for that void of myopic self absorption. I live in Alaska and I've lived in Idaho and Colorado and Oregon . . . basically AROUND people who love the great outdoors. I am more comfortable in a heated coffee shop READING about the great outdoors. Still, I know that heading into any forest - particularly one at that latitude and altitude in pursuit of adventure with (a) no food, (b) no gear, (c) no plan and (d) no backup plan is nothing short of delusional or maybe just stupid.I absolutely adore Jon Krakauer's attempts to explain Alex's possible motives and angst. I get that Krakauer identifies with some of what gnawed at Alex . . . that discontent . . . that feeling that life can't possibly be this pointless . . . etc. I wonder about those things with fairly consistent frequency. I suppose I have my own means of stamping those feelings out (alternating burst of extreme carbohydrate consumption and running or spinning; work and volunteerism). Still, the fact that Alex died of exposure in an abandoned bus in Denali National Park is less poignant than poetic - justice, that is. Darwinism, if you want to be cruel. (Cringe) That sounded really awful, didn't it? But Krakauer carefully paints a picture of a young man completely disillusioned with the life that his parents provided for him, the future they groomed him for. A life easier, better than theirs. He points to his parents' mistakes and flaws as lightening rods for Alex's rejection of them and his pursuit of deeper understanding. What a luxury. One that we all pursue at some point in our lives and if we have any sense, grow out of. I was constantly irritated with Alex for hitching, homelessness, biting every hand that tried to feed him. His lonely, desperate death not at all surprising and not terribly sad, either . . . except for what it put his family through. I had no interest in seeing the movie. I saw trailer images of a young man looking off into the wildnerness with depth and intensity and that is NOT the Alex McCandless I got to know in the book. If Sean Penn managed to paint a more enlightened image of Alex, then he deviated from the book quite a bit.!121!Into the Wild, Jon KrakauerInto the Wild is a 1996 non-fiction book written by Jon Krakauer. The book was adapted to film in 2007, directed by Sean Penn with Emile Hirsch starring as McCandless (Christopher Johnson McCandless 1968 - 1992, a young, and wise man left his family and friends and headed off into the wilderness). Into the Wild addresses the issues of how to be accepted into society, and how finding oneself sometimes conflicts with being an active member in society. Most critics agree that Chris McCandless left to find some sort of enlightenment. He also tries to find his way in the wild with minimal material possessions, because ""it made the journey more enjoyable."" His extreme risk-taking was the hubris which eventually led to his downfall. Chris McCandless was influenced by transcendentalism and the need to ""revolutionize your life and move into an entirely new realm of experience.""تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و پنجم ماه نوامبر سال2012میلادیعنوان: به سوی سرزمین سفید؛ نویسنده: جان کراکائور؛ مترجم: یحیی خویی؛ تهران، قطره، سال1391، در320 ص؛ شابک9786001195877؛ موضوع: سرگذشتنامه کریستوفر جانسون مکندلیس - ماجراجویان - ایالات متحده - رهنوردان آلاسکا - از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20مبسوی طبیعت وحشی (به سوی سرزمین سفید)، کتابی ناداستان، و بنوشته ای از «جان کراکائر (کراکائور)» است، که نخستین بار در سال1996میلادی، منتشر شده‌ است؛ این کتاب، بر اساس نگاره ی9000کلمه‌ ای نویسنده، درباره ی زندگی «کریستوفر مک‌ کندلس»، و با عنوان «مرگ یک بی‌گناه»، که در شماره ی ماه ژانویه ی مجله ی «آوتساید»، چاپ شده بود، به نگارش درآمده است؛ در سال2007میلادی نیز، اقتباسی سینمایی از آن، به کارگردانی «شان پن»، و با بازی «امیل هرش»، با عنوان «بسوی طبیعت وحشی» ساخته شدتاریخبهنگام رسانی 10/03/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 04/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!We are all heroes to ourselves. McCandless was, Krakauer is. This doesn't vary. All that varies is how we define heroism and how much, or how little, we are prepared to do to for that stance.In order to get people, usually young men, to sacrifice their lives we tell them of those that went before and tell them they were heroes who died for their countries, died for their principles, died even for their dreams. Impractical dreams that are the province of the young. And those who would be heroes never concern themselves with the practical, that is far too mundane, it is for others to take care of those details. McCandless' dream of heroism was to survive entirely alone and entirely off the land at the ends of the earth. It didn't include the practicality of learning about the wild foods he might forage in that area, or how he might survive in extreme weather conditions, or even exactly where his place of solitude was situated so that when he sought succour at the end, he didn't even know how close it really was. The final photograph he took of himself is of a wasted face, gaunt but beautiful with the shining eyes of one who has lived his dream and is satisfied. Then he died.!121!This book got me riveted in the tragic story of Chris McCandless, a young man who left his family and friends, abandoned most of his material possessions, went to the Alaska wilderness and perished there. The author does a great job of portraying McCandless complex personality through meticulous research based on interviews, letters and journal entries. The writing is so engaging that although it is already clear from the beginning how McCandless' story would end, I was hooked till the last page. Krakauer only digresses when discussing his own high-risk undertaking and those of ill-fated adventurers similar to McCandless — these parts offer comparison to McCandless' character but I found myself getting impatient and wanting them to end quickly, to return to the main story itself which is much more compelling.Readers have been divided with regard to this story. Some admire McCandless' daring and idealism; some others say he was stupid, reckless and arrogant enough to have gone to Alaska without sufficient preparation. I think he was a human being with faults and merits, but I have to admit I felt something stirring in me when I read this passage, taken from a letter he wrote to a friend:""...make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation... The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure.""The passage resonates with me because my life has been filled with stagnation and inactivity. I am the queen of conventionalism. I don't consider myself unhappy, but I'm always afraid of moving outside the comfort zone, of expanding further than my own comfortable little shell. I often don't exert myself to my best capabilities because halfhearted efforts seemed good enough. When I read about McCandless, I noticed that one of his admirable traits is if he wanted something he went out and did it. He was not afraid of challenges, the greater they are the better. Jason Mraz says ""live high, live mighty, live righteously"". I think that was what McCandless did: he lived up to his ideals. One the other hand, the greatest tragedy of McCandless' life, in my opinion, was his conflicting feelings toward human intimacy and relationship. He clashed with his parents and others who didn't share his beliefs to the point that he spurned humanity and sought nature and the wilderness instead. But even during his solitary journeys he met a lot of people and connected with them, touching their lives as well as his own. His final odyssey in Alaska had probably made him realize, more than ever, the raw need for companionship, but he didn't survive that trip — causing endless grief to his family. So in the end, if there is something I can take from McCandless story, it is this message: Be bold. Get out there. Do something. But don't forget those who love you.!121!This book seems to divide people. One group seems to think McCandless was a visionary; a free-thinking, wild spirit who lived his dream and died an unfortunate, tragic death. The other group thinks he was a stupid kid; an ill-prepared daydreamer who brought his demise upon himself due to his own idiocy.I think it's entirely possible he was both. In my experience, the two states are not mutually exclusive. The one thing that's clearly true is that his death was avoidable and tragic. Whichever camp you fall into, this is an upsetting tale.What also upsets me is that, due to the media picking up on this case, with various newspaper and magazine articles being written about it, a movie being made and (the surefire win for anyone looking to be a teenage martyr) a soundtrack album being recorded by hipster messiah Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, McCandless is being promoted as an inspirational figure for impressionable young people.I can only hope that they will take this sad tale onboard as a cautionary tale, rather than one to emulate.!121!Not marking my spoilers as I believe most people know the basic story. If you don't, proceed with caution!I liked this book okay - it is probably my least favorite Krakauer book, but I think that was because my feelings about it were tainted by the main character. McCandless was soooooo frustrating. He went about the free spirit/return to the wild thing all wrong. He refused help and destroyed his resources with the belief that that was what was required to survive on your own. No! Be prepared! Learn basic skills! Accept free help! All of those things would have still allowed him to be a vagabond and he might still be alive today.Also frustrating is the fact that I hear some people idolizing McCandless. They want to be like him, they think he approached getting away from it all in a wise fashion, they martyr him (maybe not realizing that it was his own ineptitude that caused his death??).Please read this as a cautionary tale, not as a guidebook for escaping life and responsibilities. If you do, I am sorry to say, you may meet the same fate.!121!84th book of 2020.S.O.S. I NEED YOUR HELP. I AM INJURED, NEAR DEATH, AND TOO WEAK TO HIKE OUT OF HERE. I AM ALL ALONE, THIS IS NO JOKE. IN THE NAME OF GOD, PLEASE REMAIN TO SAVE ME. I AM OUT COLLECTING BERRIES CLOSE BY AND SHALL RETURN THIS EVENING. THANK YOU, CHRIS MCCANDLESS. AUGUST? I’m unsure how to start this review; for the first time in a while, I’m finding it difficult to access my thoughts on this. I’ve got so much to say, but even after waiting a whole day, my thoughts are all scrambled in the wind. I’ll start with this. At 2am the other night I tapped the touch-lamp on my bedside table and opened my copy of Into the Wild – in pencil, I scrawled, “Literature Failed the Heroes in this Book.” It is pictured below. I then turned out my light, rolled over, and went to sleep. I was born in 1997 – five years after Chris McCandless died. The note I used to start the review was found on the bus his body was in. He weighed about four stone. Jon Krakauer wrote an article about the 24 year old boy who died in Alaska, but his obsession held him longer, long enough to write this beautiful, horrible book. I am glad that he did. This book transcends being about McCandless.One does not look have to look far to find people laughing at McCandless, calling him an idiot, or worst of all – “He deserved to die.” Ironically, comments like these, which have been wrenching my heart, came out my own brother’s mouth. Though my brother is one to speak rashly, and flippantly about things, he said to me over the dinner table, after I explained the book rather briefly, that it sounded like McCandless was an “idiot”. We are very unalike. My brother sees the world in black and white. He believes something or he doesn’t, there are no grey areas in his life. It was at the dinner table this happened, and when I opened my mouth, clearly some sort of fury or defiance in my eyes, my mother gave me the don’t eyes, the drop-it eyes. Chances are my brother said it only to get a rise out of me, though I think he partly believed what he was saying. McCandless, as far as he was aware, as far as many people are aware, went into Alaska with almost no equipment, no food, and little idea on what he was going to do. He survived 114 days.Literature is DangerousI’ve been unpacking my little late-night scrawl. I awoke in the morning thinking, “Why the hell did I write that? What does that even mean?” I put it down to trying to be clever, 2am delusions. But, I’ve thought about it, and I now stand by my past, tired self. I do not mean that literature is to blame for McCandless’ death, or any of the other people in the book that Krakauer tells us about. What I mean to say, I think, is that they were failed by literature. Literature is dangerous. Book burnings show how intimidating books can be. Rushdie’s six-million pound bounty for writing The Satanic Verses is a modern day testament to the power of books, and the consequences of writing. It’s interesting to think that just about anyone, the most malleable of teenagers, can read books by mad philosophers, to take fiction literally. McCandless loved Jack London, Tolstoy, Thoreau. Krakauer takes us on a jaunt in his own life, when, a year younger than McCandless was in Alaska, he nearly lost his life climbing the Devils Thumb. He admitted to be on a high from reading too much Nietzsche and Kerouac – as if these were factors of his journey. They were. They were for McCandless too. Each chapter of this book starts with a quote, many of which are highlighted quotes from the paperbacks found with McCandless’ body, and many of them mirror the existence the young man was striving for. So, in way, literature inspired McCandless, Krakauer too, into searching for more meaning in life, for something bigger than themselves. To quote Kerouac, “Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.” If that doesn’t make your heart swell with possibility, with ideas of escape, or living in fresh air and leaving behind this mundane 21st century life, then I don’t know what will. And if doesn’t, maybe that’s proof that terrifyingly, if I were less safe and secure in my home, if I lived in America, I could have been a McCandless, or a Krakauer, depending how lucky I was.I’ve read a lot of Kerouac. I’m getting interested in spirituality, Buddhism, the soul, the nature world. Things that seem to steer me towards the life that the men in this book began striving for. Krakauer is impartial, though you can sense some to some degree a biased opinion, he is mostly removed from the book, leaving it entirely up to the reader to decide for themselves. He includes some of the comments he had, the negative, attacking ones. There are also arguments on my side of the fence: It is hardly unusual for a young man to be drawn to a pursuit considered reckless by his elders; engaging in risky behaviour is a rite of passage in our culture no less than in most others. Danger has always held a certain allure. That, in large part, is why so many teenagers drive too fast and drink too much and take too many drugs, why it has always been so easy for nations to recruit young men to go to war: It can be argued that youthful derring-do is in fact evolutionary adaptive, a behaviour merely encoded in our genes. McCandless knew the risks, and Krakauer allows that he was arrogant too, he was unprepared, yes. His failings do not, cannot, outlive what McCandless was trying to do. A 24 year old man does not die to be remembered for his failings. At least, his words will be remembered.It is the experiences, the memories, the great triumphant joy of living to the fullest extent in which real meaning is found. God it’s great to be alive! Thank you. Thank you.Heroes in this BookThis book moved me so much is because of the parallels I have found, possibly projected, in McCandless. I am currently 23, just a year younger than he was. I have a love of literature, some say “obsessive” love, for literature. I am into the outdoors, I have been to many countries, I was in the scouts for most of my childhood, I adore camping and walking… I love the things that McCandless loves. And above all, I can imagine, as I have suggested, if I was less invested in my life here, I can picture myself doing something similar. Maybe not Alaska, and maybe not without supplies, or a map, but certainly walking out with grand (maybe naïve) ideas of transcendence found in the wilderness. Krakauer makes an important distinction: McCandless didn’t want to die, that much is clear from the S.O.S note. In the end, he must have known he was dying, which does pain me a little to admit that he was in that bus, dying, and he knew it. I won’t reveal all the heart-breaking notebook entries, but there are some which show that despite his situation, McCandless was happy. He had escaped civilisation; he was living a truer life than his hero, Jack London, even more than Tolstoy. They were hypocrites where McCandless wasn’t. He lived the life he wanted to live, he lived the life he chose to live. I couldn’t count the amount of people I know that I believe live lives of unfulfilled yearning. It is the most common thing in today’s society – with social media we constantly see lives that we think would be better, lives that we imagine for ourselves. Oh, to be more attractive. Oh, to be more famous. Oh, to be richer. We strive for lives that we can’t achieve, or else lives that we can’t be bothered to try and achieve. McCandless died with complete fulfilment in the life he wanted. He carved through the bullshit of life and reached the epicentre of his yearnings. His yearning was the death of him. But I dare say that he died having fulfilled himself, more than most of the people I know in my own life. Possibly, more than I will ever be able to fulfil my own life. That is why I call the people in this book “Heroes.” The photo in this review is one of McCandless' final acts - one hand holding his final note toward the camera lens, the other raised in a brave, beatific farewell. Krakauer goes on to say this, of the photograph: But if he pitied himself in those last difficult hours- because he was so young, because he was alone, because his body had betrayed him and his will had let him down- it's not apparent from the photograph. He is smiling in the picture, and there is no mistaking the look in his eyes: Chris McCandless was at peace, serene as a monk gone to God. Or as McCandless once wrote of himself in the third person, But his spirit is soaring.!121!প্রকৃতির খুব কাছাকাছি থাকলে কেমন ফিল হতো তা বই পড়েই পেয়ে গেছি।বই পড়ার পর মুভিটিও দেখে ফেলেছি চমৎকার একটি মুভি আপনারা যারা দেখেননি দেখে ফেলতে পারেন।বই পড়লে বেশি ফিল পাবেন তবে মুভিটাও অনেক ভালো করেছে।!121!I don't know why everyone went so wild over this book or this kid - is there one without the other? It seems like people only cared because it was a Jon Krakauer book that translated well to Hollywood. The guy in the book didn't even have enough material about himself to make a whole book and every other chapter is about some other person who did a similar ""disappearance into nature."" Dying because you don't know how to take care of yourself in the wild is no reason for society to glorify your life.!121!On the outside looking in, this seems like another case of arrogant human vs unassuming nature. Nature usually wins that fight. It did here and in a most tragic way. And yet, in Into the Wild Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of muddying up the waters, so that they flow with the natural fluidity of life itself. Was this kid so very unprepared? Was this a foolhardy and unnecessary death easily avoided with a few, slight precautions? Life is seldom black and white, cut and dry. Krakauer reminds us of that, while telling a riveting story.!121!What a dumbass.!121!The article written by J. Krakauer was totally enlarged to make this, an obsessive journalistic account of an obsession. I am sure that the core of it is included in this 200 pg book somewhere (the anecdote: young incompetent kid dies out in the wilderness); it should be short and sweet, however it is exhaustively stretched out (obviously to capitalize on the popular story) to include stories of the own writer himself as a kid (conceited!) plus brief accounts by people who met the young mentally ill man. Also, there's a long (but interesting) section which includes tales of other intrepid nonconformist isolationists. Why couldn't this kid just learn his lesson on moderation? Had this dude been into heroin instead, the results would have been strikingly similar (minus, of course, the book).!121!Into the Wild was an interesting read, but I have been having trouble in putting a rating on it. I had heard vague aspects about Christopher McCandless in the past, and until now, I'd never actually read anything about his life, and his tragic end.This book was extremely well written. It is thorough in regards to investigating as to why and how McCandless died, and even the events leading up to his death. I enjoyed the author's writing style, and if I'm honest, I was totally pulled in to this story.We meet a handful of witnesses who knew McCandless on a personal level, and they make a valued contribution to his story. I really enjoyed this read, but I disagree that McCandless is indeed being hailed a hero for the time he spent in the wild. Yes, it is definitely horrendous the way in which he died, but, in my personal opinion, he came across as a selfish and conceited character, who held no care for the people that loved him, therefore, breaking his families hearts. His death could have been entirely avoided had he not been so hubristic and pompous. Also, I think that creating a film out of this was completely the wrong thing to do. What kind of message are we sending out to kids that are easily influenced? This story should be used as a stark warning, not a celebration. I'm glad I read this, and I liked Krakauer's style, despite not agreeing with the way this story was publicised.!121!Another well-written book by Jon Krakauer, this was a fascinating, and often sad, glimpse into the spiral down of an idealistic young man, Christopher McCandless. Even when his decision-making didn't make sense, the reader still somehow identifies with the internal struggle this young man was going through, and his journey becomes theirs to take with him. It seems terrible to say I enjoyed this book, but I really did. If nothing else, it allowed me to identify with someone else's struggles, while seeing from a safe distance the fallacy in their thinking.★★★★ ½!121!🏔️🌲 A young man hikes into the Alaskan wilderness to see if he can survive and live off the land. But his story soon becomes a tragedy. (Nonfiction.) It’s gut wrenching really.[The author also wrote a book about an infamous climbing disaster that occurred on Everest entitled Into Thin Air.]!121!3ish stars.The movie adaptation is one of my all-time faves. Of course, while this book is an unnecessarily expanded version of what was originally an article written by Krakauer, the movie turns it into an epic, dramatized, stranger-than-fiction, based-on-a -true-story biopic of Christopher McCandless. McCandless in the book is still an enigmatic, magnetic, fascinating man, but would I have felt the same if I hadn't already loved Emile Hirsch's portrayal of him? Would I have been affected as much by the touching, powerful relationships he shared with Jan Burres, and Ron Franz if I hadn't been picturing the incredible cinematic performances of Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook in my mind? McCandless's story is awe-inspiring regardless, but Krakauer stretches it far past the breaking point by including narratives of other, similarly ill-fated explorers (including his own experiences), among other frivolous details that I honestly could have done without. One of the uncommon instances where the movie surpasses the book, but I'm not disappointed I read it. Makes me want to get out and go hiking or backpacking; my wife and I have a goal to visit each of the 59 U.S. National Parks (we've been to 10/59 so far, a long way to go). Or if nothing else, to watch the movie again. :)Posted in Mr. Philip's Library!121!Krakauer makes the basic facts of Christopher McCandless's trek into the Alaskan wilderness and his death nearly 4 months later clear from the outset. Even though I'd heard a lot about this case, that's just the beginning of the story. His motivations, especially since graduating college a year earlier, are what make this story interesting. As some of McCandless's ideas about living a new kind of life off the map come into focus, Krakauer continues to highlight the harsh realities McCandless chose to face. While what McCandless was trying to do might be appealing to some, Krakauer reminds readers that McCandless was ill-prepared for the dangers. Ultimately, of course, the new life he had fashioned was cut short by tragedy. 3.75 stars!121!I think a lot of the people who have formed negative opinions of this story are really missing the point. Most people rage on and on about what a terribly selfish, careless idiot Chris McCandless was, to which I say, duh. John Krakauer points out many, many times that Chris was ""heedless"" and ""overconfident."" I never once felt that Krakauer idolized him or tried to make him into a hero. He was fascinated by McCandless, sure, and he certainly seems to have seen a lot of himself in the young man, but by no means does he gush about what a fantastic person or brave adventurer McCandless was.Chris McCandless is fascinating to me because, despite how frustratingly foolhardy and arrogant he may come across (who's to say really - none of us ever knew him), I am astounded by the number of people who fell head over heels for him in such a short period of time. Grown men and women! It seems impossible that his flaws outweighed his character. The people he met over the course of his travels genuinely seemed to love him, but Chris was just one of those strange individuals who don't really want to be loved.I do hope his parents and sister were able to find peace with McCandless's death. It's very hard to keep giving away your love to someone who simply doesn't want it.!121!""Not all those who wander are lost"" seems to be the focus of this non-fiction biography by Krakauer about a young man named Chris McCandless who went into the Alaskan wilderness, but never came out again. Krakauer examines McCandless' history, friendships, and probable motivations while also comparing his case to other young men who died or disappeared in the wilderness. He also gets very personal and recounts a solo mountain climbing adventure of his own that nearly went south, but didn't- crediting his survival to luck rather than skill. Into the Wild paints McCandless as a man with a brilliant mind and the soul of an artist, who didn't fit in to the modern world's or his family's view of how he was supposed to be.""In April 1992, a young man from a well-to-do East Coast family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Four months later his decomposed body was found by a party of moose hunters."" pg 10, ebook. For much of the book, Krakauer tries to figure out what ultimately ended McCandless's life. In the edition I read, he had a new afterword that he penned in April 2015, talking about his definitive theory for why McCandless died. If you haven't read the book since it was published, I really recommend picking up a new edition if only to read that.Krakauer includes actual journal entries from McCandless's wanderings, which I thought gave us a pretty clear window into the man's mind: ""It is the experiences, the memories, the great triumphant joy of living to the fullest extent in which real meaning is found. God it's great to be alive! Thank you. Thank you."" pg 37, ebook. We saw a man who cared about life, about the way he was living, and about the way he interacted with others.It is curious to me that his relationship with his parents wasn't better, but I'll let Krakauer tell you all about it: ""McCandless's personality was puzzling in its complexity. He was intensely private but could be convivial and gregarious in the extreme. And despite his overdeveloped social conscience, he was no tight-lipped, perpetually grim do-gooder who frowned on fun. To the contrary, he enjoyed tipping a glass now and then and was an incorrigible ham."" pg 95As interesting as McCandless's story is, my favorite part of this book was Krakauer's experience solo climbing the Devil's Thumb in Alaska. ""By and by your attention becomes so intensely focused that you no longer notice the raw knuckles, the cramping thighs, the strain of maintaining nonstop concentration. A trancelike state settles over your efforts; the climb becomes a clear-eyed dream. Hours slide by like minutes. The accumulated clutter of day-to-day existence- the lapses of conscience, the unpaid bills, the bungled opportunities, the dust under the couch, the inescapable prison of your genes- all of it is temporarily forgotten, crowded from your thoughts by an overpowering clarity of purpose and by the seriousness of the task at hand."" pg 115, ebook. That passage made me wonder- what sorts of things do I like to do in my life as much as Krakauer loves climbing? It seems to me, that the state of flow he's describing there, would be a place that I would like to dwell in as much as possible.Recommended for folks who like to read about people with unconventional life styles or if you're looking for a book about the human spirit. Into the Wild is a book about why people wander, what they may find, and, sadly, the loved ones they leave behind. Some further reading: Naked and Marooned: One Man. One Island., Man's Search for Meaning, or A Death on Diamond Mountain: A True Story of Obsession, Madness, and the Path to Enlightenment.!121!I first read Into the Wild ten years ago when it first came out after finding out that parts of it are set in Carthage, Miner County, South Dakota pop. 187, a town where my mother has family and where her cousin was once mayor. My great-grandmother is buried in Howard, the Miner county seat. So that was the book and movie’s initial appeal. I mean this town is the true “blink-and-you-miss-it” town. That is, if one would ever even happen to drive through it as it isn’t on a main road. So I wondered, how young Chris McCandless, the subject of the book and movie ended up in Carthage in the first place.Then I read that Sean Penn was finally making a movie adapted from the book and filming in Carthage. I thought it would be really interesting to see Carthage on the big screen. The first day it was showing in our little theater here in town I Shanghaied my husband (who really isn’t a movie goer, in fact if you ask him, on a scale of 1-10, that he’d suggest going to a movie as a form of entertainment he’d probably tell you –2) into going with me for the matinee. Now John had seen the Oprah show where Sean Penn and Emile Hirsch (who portrays young McCandless in the film) were guests along with author Jon Krakauer and didn’t think too much of McCandless so he was even less excited than usual about seeing this film. If he had known ahead of time that it was 140 minutes long he’d probably had left the theater after his first carton of Milk Duds. But the trooper he is, he persevered for my sake.The movie adequately told the story of young Christopher McCandless who after graduating from Emory University, took off on a two year road trip, calling himself Alexander Supertramp. Very early on his car was destroyed and he abandoned it, burned what little money he had left and took off on foot. Some one say he was idealist others an adventurer, but others just reckless. Everyone seems to have his or her own opinion. What is clear is that he was found two year later dead in an abandoned bus just north of Denali National Park in Alaska. However his adventures along the way and the people he met tell a very interesting story. And the just how he died is still fodder for speculation although Krakauer does give his theory. Hirsch as McCandless is wonderful – his portrayal deserves an Oscar nomination as does that of Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, the elderly recluse who befriends him. Told mostly in flashbacks, the movie suffers from uneven editing. I was also disappointed in the cinematography—the Alaskan scenes could have been brilliant but they were just average. That said, the South Dakota prairie was breathtaking. And it was fun to see Carthage. I think the entire town was filmed.After watching the movie, I was compelled to read the book again. At only 207 pages it’s a fairly quick read. It was even more meaningful after watching the movie. I read many passages out loud to my husband and told him I thought he might change his opinion of McCandless. He is now reading the book. I don’t have the absolutely negative opinion of young Chris as many people have. He was a bit reckless, that’s for sure. But no more than many young men. As Krakauer mentions late in the book, it’s that attribute of daring that contributes to many young men signing up for the military—particularly in times of war. Yes, he did some things wrong. But don’t we all. The only reason that we’re reading about him was that he made some little mistakes that ended up killing him. He was actually a smart kid and I found a lot in him to be admired. It was sad he had to die. Any loss of life is sad. And that is what bothers me the most. That a parent lost a child, that a sister lost a brother, that a world lost a promising young man. There are lessons to be learned here, of course, but was the price too great?!121!In this short book by a pre-eminent outdoors writer, one experiences an American tragedy – the saga of a smart, idealistic, and profoundly misguided young man. Christopher McCandless, a talented young university graduate from an affluent suburban family, turned his back on “traditional” ideas of American success, cut ties with his family, gave away all his money, and went West, seeking a transcendent experience in the isolation of the Alaskan wilderness – but instead found an early death from starvation. In his 1996 book Into the Wild, writer and outdoorsman Jon Krakauer tells the story of this young man, Christopher McCandless, in a compelling and dramatic manner.From the time of his childhood, Krakauer harboured a passion for mountain-climbing, and his books have often combined an appreciation for the beauty and glory of the outdoors with a cautionary quality – a plea to the reader to understand that the wilderness can be as dangerous and unforgiving as it is beautiful. These themes apply to Into Thin Air, Krakauer’s 1997 account of surviving a disastrous 1996 attempt to climb Mount Everest, as well as they apply to Into the Wild.Into the Wild developed from an article about McCandless that Krakauer wrote for Outside magazine in 1993; the article generated more letters-to-the-editor responses than any other article in the history of the magazine. The dramatic, almost archetypal quality of the story of Chris McCandless’s life and death makes it understandable that reader interest in the story would be so intense.The early chapters of Into the Wild chronicle Chris McCandless’s upbringing in a well-to-do household in the tony D.C.-area suburb of Annandale, Virginia. His relationship with his parents was always somewhat fraught, but they seem to have thought that he might be finding his life path when he attended Emory University in Atlanta and graduated with excellent grades. After his graduation from Emory, however, Chris McCandless abandoned his law-school plans, gave away all his money, and headed west, leaving his parents no forwarding address: he simply disappeared from their lives. He must have felt, Krakauer suggests, that “At long last he was unencumbered, emancipated from the stifling world of his parents and peers, a world of abstraction and security and material excess, a world in which he felt grievously cut off from the raw throb of existence” (p. 22).He even gave himself a new name – “Alexander Supertramp.” While Krakauer does not speculate on the meaning of the name, the first name “Alexander” seems clearly enough an indicator of an ambition to conquer new worlds. At first, I thought the last name “Supertramp” might mean that Chris McCandless was a fellow fan of the British progressive-rock band of Breakfast in America fame; but in fact, the name was probably inspired by the book Autobiography of a Super-Tramp (1908) by W.H. Davies, a Welsh writer who had spent years living the rootless life of a “tramp” in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States of America. Perhaps Chris McCandless hoped that he, like Davies, could be an outstanding success in the transient lifestyle – a “super-tramp.” Unfortunately, his hopes would go unrealized. Krakauer seeks to understand Chris’s iconoclastic and adventurous spirit, even while critiquing the impractical aspects of Chris’s quest for meaning and fulfillment – the manner in which Chris’s idealism was, all too often, unencumbered by any degree of realism or critical thinking. Toward that end, Krakauer quotes extensively from the journal in which Chris described his wild adventures.At one point, Chris McCandless befriended an older gentleman, Ronald A. Franz (not his real name), who lived alone near the Salton Sea in inland California, and the story of their friendship reveals much about Krakauer’s feelings regarding Chris and his quest. Ronald Franz befriended Chris, gave him shelter, taught him leatherworking, and even eventually offered to adopt Chris as a grandson; but Chris refused to stay and insisted on pushing on with his plans of going north to Alaska.Of this time from Chris’s odyssey, Krakauer writes that “When McCandless came into [Franz’s] world, the boy undermined the old man’s meticulously constructed defenses. Franz relished being with McCandless, but their burgeoning friendship also reminded him how lonely he’d been. The boy unmasked the gaping void in Franz’s life even as he helped fill it. When McCandless departed as suddenly as he’d arrived, Franz found himself deeply and unexpectedly hurt” (p. 55).Here, one of the major themes of Into the Wild begins to emerge – the idea that Chris McCandless’s quest, for all that it might appeal to many people’s visions of shaking off civilization’s restraints and seeking something more real, also has a profoundly selfish quality to it. That impression is reinforced by the breezy, preachy quality of McCandless’s later letters to the broken-hearted old man:So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun….You are wrong if you think joy emanates only or principally from human relationships. God has placed it all around us. It is in everything and anything we might experience. We just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living. (pp. 56-57)Chris McCandless made another friend, a farmer and businessman named Wayne Westerberg, in Carthage, South Dakota, and worked for a time at Westerberg’s grain elevator. But Chris, though he was asked to stay, insisted on leaving for his Alaskan adventure, later writing to Westerberg that “If this adventure proves fatal and you don’t ever hear from me again, I want you to know you’re a great man. I now walk into the wild” (p. 68). It is from this letter, of course, that Krakauer takes the title for his book.Background information on Chris McCandless’s parents, sister, and family life reinforces an impression that the reader is already likely to have gathered – that “It is impossible to know what murky convergence of chromosomal matter, parent-child dynamics, and alignment of the cosmos was responsible, but Christopher Johnson McCandless came into the world with unusual gifts and a will not easily deflected from its trajectory” (p. 106).Krakauer says that, with his own history of adolescent conflicts with his father, and of being drawn to potentially risky outdoor activities, he finds that he can identify, in a number of ways, with Chris McCandless’s restless and inquiring spirit. He recalls, with regard to an ill-planned and near-disastrous mountain-climbing adventure that he endured on the Stikine Ice Cap in Alaska, that “at the age of 23, personal mortality – the idea of my own death – was still largely outside my conceptual grasp” (p. 150), and adds that “It is easy, when you are young, to believe that what you desire is no less than what you deserve, to assume that if you want something badly enough, it is your God-given right to have it” (p. 155). To those who assumed that Chris McCandless went out into the Alaskan wild in an act of elaborately staged slow-motion suicide, Krakauer, I think, would offer an alternative explanation. For Krakauer, Chris McCandless is an intelligent and talented - and at the same time, in some ways a woefully naïve - young man.Chris McCandless’s final adventure involved his setting out along Alaska’s Stampede Trail, setting up in an old Fairbanks city bus that had been left out on the taiga as workers’ housing for a long-abandoned project, and seeking to live off the land by gathering edible plants and hunting game. While he lost a great deal of weight, as shown by photographs he took of himself over the course of his time in the bush, he seems to have maintained his health and his state of mind fairly well. But then one mistake and one fateful element of mischance set his adventure awry, and put him on a path toward his early death. Krakauer traces it all, even venturing out to the old Fairbanks City Bus #142 to see the place where Chris McCandless lived and died. His description of what he sees there is moving and evocative, as are his reflections upon the possible causes of Chris’s demise.If you are going to read Into the Wild, then I would recommend that you seek out the 2015 edition of the book. Over the 19 years after the original publication of the book, Krakauer kept on coming back to the story of Chris McCandless. One gets the sense that, in spite of the wide variety of topics that Krakauer has addressed over the course of his career – “adventure tourism,” polygamy among some religious sects in the American West, sexual assault on college campuses – the saga of Chris McCandless may be the story that has stuck with him the most.An emotional epilogue chronicles the time when Krakauer travelled with Chris’s mother and father to the Fairbanks City Bus #142 site. And a new afterword emphasizes how “The debate over what killed Chris McCandless, and the related question of whether he is worthy of admiration, has been smoldering and occasionally flaring for more than two decades now” (p. 205). Through the afterword, one can trace the steps in Krakauer’s ongoing fascination with the Chris McCandless story:•	2007: A feature-film adaptation of Into the Wild is released. The film – directed by Sean Penn, with a cast that includes Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener, Zach Galifianakis, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, and Hal Holbrook, along with a musical soundtrack composed by Eddie Vedder – wins widespread critical acclaim and is nominated for two Academy Awards. In the same year, Krakauer publishes a new edition of the book, with a second possible explanation for Chris’s death. Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that this new explanation relates to differing properties of alkaloids.•	2013: After reading an online article that offered a third possible explanation for Chris’s death, Krakauer initiates a new round of chromatographic research and publishes on the New Yorker website an article titled “How Chris McCandless Died.” The article is criticized for not constituting or incorporating peer-reviewed research. Krakauer continues with further chromatographic research and testing.•	2014: Krakauer co-authors, with four doctorate-bearing scholars, an article that is published in the peer-reviewed journal Wilderness and Environmental Medicine. This article sets forth a fourth possible cause for the death of Chris McCandless – one that (and again, I am trying to avoid the need for a spoiler alert) relates to amino acids rather than alkaloids.All of this speaks to the fascination that the Chris McCandless story has held for Jon Krakauer. It may hold the same sort of fascination for you, too. For my part, I found that I could relate to Chris McCandless in a number of ways. Like Chris, I grew up in an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C.; and while I knew and appreciated how my parents had worked hard to give me and my siblings that comfortable suburban lifestyle, I couldn’t help seeing in it all a certain measure of intellectual and spiritual sterility. I know that when I was in my early twenties, I could be arrogant, self-righteous, self-focused, and judgmental. We can probably all think of poor and risky decisions that we made at that time in our lives – but most of us have the good fortune to survive, and learn from, our youthful mistakes. What makes Chris McCandless different from many of us is perhaps a matter of degree rather than kind: his luck ran out, whereas, for most of us, our luck held.Into the Wild is the sort of book that gets one thinking very hard about such things. If only one could talk about these issues with Christopher McCandless – who, at the time that I write this review from a ship anchored in a glacial bay in Alaska, would, if he were still living, be 55 years old, perhaps with children of his own.!121!Jon Krakauer possesses a phenomenal skill in taking a non-fiction story and telling it in a way that does not bog you down in unmemorable details; but instead keeps you engrossed in the unfolding details of what happens next. In this story, Into the Wild, Mr. Krakauer tells the emotional story of a young man… Christopher McCandless, who in April of 1992, hiked into the Alaskan wilderness and never walked out. I listened to the audiobook version of this story and the fine narration was performed by Philip Franklin.Although it quickly became apparent to me that Christopher McCandless' story had been widely covered in the national media at that time, I had been personally unaware of the story so it was completely fresh for me. Mr. Krakauer tells the story in an entertaining and yet informative manner… he not only attempts to trace the steps of Chris McCandless through McCandless's own writings.. such as letters and excerpts from a personal journal found among his personal effects after his death; but he also details interviews he conducted with people Chris McCandless met along his journey and his family members. He even relates snippets from his own personal history, seemingly able to personally identify with Chris McCandless and his feelings of wanderlust and his troubled relationship with his father. Much of Chris McCandless's story is simply conjecture. What IS known is that he came from a well-to-do family outside of Washington, D.C. After graduating from Emory University in 1990, he cut off all ties to family and friends. He changed his name to 'Alexander Supertramp', gave away everything he owned, including the $24,000 in his savings account to OXFAM, his car (an old Datsun) , and he burned all of the cash in his wallet. 'Alex'/Chris then set off across the country …. hitchhiking and doing odd and short term jobs along the way , making just enough cash to continue on. Finally, in April 1992, 'Alex'/Chris hitchhiked to Alaska and walked into the wilderness north of Mt.McKinley… carrying only a backpack containing a 10 pound bag of rice, a Remington rifle, some cooking utensils, a sleeping bag and an array of paperback books.The portrait of Chris McCandless which takes place in this narrative seems to me to be one that is relatively common for someone his age. Chris McCandless was a contradiction.. as are many young people who are trying to figure out who they are and where they fit into society. He was intelligent, stubborn, had a very strong sense of social justice and seemed acutely aware of the inherent hypocrisy present in society… most especially among those he considered authority figures (his father, for example). At the same time, he could be short sighted, unforgiving at times.. especially of those who loved him most, and couldn't recognize his own hypocrisy concerning his unwillingness or inability to forgive those closest to him; but seemed to quite easily overlook those same failings in people he was said to admire but didn't really know. Chris seemed to be simply a young man struggling with his own identity and wrestling with accepting the reality of what it means to be a human being…. full of strengths, weaknesses and contradictions. One question continued to arise for me as I listened to this story… was Chris McCandless understandable and perhaps even admirable… or was he simply just a foolish and short sighted young man who didn't seem to recognize his own ignorance of what it would take for him to survive in such harsh conditions? I struggled with my feelings about this young man and what he did; but in the end, I would have to say that he was both understandable AND incredibly foolish.As a parent of children who are similar in age to Chris McCandless, I was horrified by his seeming lack of caring about how his parents and siblings must have felt, having no idea where he was, what he was doing… or if he was even alive. I felt angry over his self-centeredness in not considering the feelings of anyone who cared about him. Oddly, at the same time, I COULD remember sharing some of his feelings when I was young and I also remember that it could be difficult at times to put those feelings in any kind of context…. and those feelings could often be overwhelming. Ultimately, Chris McCandless's story left me full of sadness at the unnecessary tragedy that befell him.. and his family. After all, Chris McCandless's story WAS a tragedy. Just a few short months after walking into the Alaskan wilderness, some hikers discovered his body in an old abandoned Fairbanks City Transit System bus (#142). Taped to the door of the bus was a note… ""S.O.S. I need your help. I am injured, near death and too weak to hike out of here. I am all alone, this is NO JOKE. In the name of God, please  remain to save me. I am out collecting berries close by and shall return this evening. Thank you. Chris McCandless, August 7?""I found this story compelling and at the same time so very unnecessary and tragic. And although Mr. Krakauer did his best to describe the geography of the locations in the story, I found some of the details confusing as I'm unfamiliar with Alaskan geography. Perhaps this geographic confusion was better addressed in the print copy of this book. Regardless, I definitely recommend this book.","['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'School']"
Man’s Search for Meaning (Paperback),Viktor E. Frankl,4.37,704937,1959,"Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man's Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.","I read this book for the first time during my senior year in high school. The year prior, I had gone to Germany for spring break with some fellow classmates. During the trip, we spent a day visiting a former WWII concentration camp in Dachau. As one might expect, this visit had a profound effect on me. I had of course read and knew about the atrocities that occurred under the Nazi regime, but to actually see a camp in person is a deeply haunting and disturbing experience. Perhaps for this reason, Frankl's book affected me even more deeply than it otherwise might have. The book is divided into two parts. The first section recounts in vivid detail Frankl's horrifying experiences as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. Frankl, a former psychiatrist, also describes his observations of other prisoners and what he felt to be the main way in which people tried to cope with the insurmountable obstacles they faced. He found that those who could find meaning or purpose in their suffering were the ones who also seemed better able to find the strength to go on. As I recall, Frankl personally found his purpose in the hope of someday being able to see his wife again - a hope that was strong enough to get him through the daily horrors he faced.The second half of this book is devoted to the therapy he developed based on the search for meaning, which he calls logotherapy. The basic premise is that those who can find meaning in their suffering are better able to cope with what would otherwise be a struggle too hard to bear. As one who majored in psychology, I found this section as fascinating as the first.I have read this book at least three times now, and it is one of the few books I can say truly changed my life. I am ever grateful that I have the wisdom of this book to fall back upon when needed. Several years ago, at a very young age (in my 20s), I became ill with a disease that left me bedridden and barely able to speak above a whisper. Now 36, I am still bedridden and fighting the same battle. It is Frankl's reminder to find meaning and purpose in suffering (which I found in the love of my fiancé and my hope of recovery) that has helped me to get through each difficult day. As Frankl tells us, ""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.""I highly recommend this book!!!121!After I read this book, which I finished many, many years ago, I had become self-critical of any future endeavours which would take up a lot of my time. I would ask myself ""is this or will this be meaningful to me?"", and if the answer was ""no"", I wouldn't do it. It was this book that influenced me to consciously live as meaningful a life as possible, to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination, while knowing that ""meaningful"" doesn't always mean ""enjoyable"". ""Meaningful"" should be equated with ""fulfilling"". So I studied Physics instead of Engineering. I went to York U instead of U of T. I went to Europe instead of immediately entering the workforce after graduation. I want to recommend this book to all of my grade 12 students.!121!How is it possible to write dispassionately of life in a concentration camp in such a way as to engender great feeling in the reader? This is how Frankl dealt with his experience of those terrible years. The dispassionate writing makes the horrors of the camp extremely distressing, more so than writing that is more emotionally involved. It is almost reportage. The first half of the book is equal in its telling to The Diary of a Young Girl in furthering our understanding of those dreadful times.There are occasional glimmers of humanity from the Germans. These are so small that rather than illuminate any basic goodness, they cast further into the shadows the terror of living in a place and time where death might be a beating or a shot to the head at any moment. There are also stories of the depths that some of the Jewish victims would sink to in what they would do to stay alive themselves. It made me think that rather than condemn these people for becoming tools of the Nazis, what would I do faced with death or the chance to stay alive a little longer and maybe save family or friends. 7 stars, golden stars for this half of the book.The second half is about Frankl's psychotherapeutic methods and lost me in boredom. I did read this in its entirety but it wouldn't have spoiled the book, or my appreciation of the genius retelling and brilliant writing of the first half, if I hadn't.!121!For most of the book, I felt as dumbfounded as I would have been if I were browsing through a psychiatric journal. Filled with references and technical terms and statistics, it was mostly a book-long affirmation of the then innovative technique called 'logo-therapy'. I do not understand how this book is still relevant and found in most popular book stores. It might have been that the book was popular in the sixties and seventies as it offered a powerful and logical argument against the reductionist approach that leads inevitably to existential nihilism, but is that still relevant today? It also attempts to free psychiatry from the belief that 'eros' was the cause of all neurosis and turns the flashlight on repressed 'logos' - which forms the premise of the book and the title. But, while the basic premises are powerful and moving, the breadth and scale of repetition of the same ideas and the technical jargon and the constant Freud-bashing ensured that I did not enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. Furthermore, the whole chapter dedicated to the theory that ultimately our basic necessity of 'search for logos' can also be explained as a 'repressed religious drive' and his exhortation to religious people to not look down on irreligious ones (read atheists and agnostics) just because they have achieved a stage that the atheists/agnostics are still aspiring (unconsciously of course) towards rang patently false and too much in line with his argument of psychiatry being a sister to theology.I wish Frankl had stuck to his original title of 'The Unconscious God' - it would have been more representative of the book as his 'logos' argument directly derives from his postulation of a transcendent unconscious super-ego that trumps Freud's 'Super Ego' and a spiritual cum instinctual subconscious that trumps Freud's 'id'.Unless you are looking for a historical perspective on the technical aspects of psychiatry and about the origins of 'logo-therapy', I would not recommend this book, especially for general reading. If you pick up this book, like I did, in the hope that it is about Frankl's personal quest for meaning amidst the horrors of Auschwitz with a strong scientific perspective, you will be disappointed to find that you have picked up a medical journal that is pedantic and repetitive, with hardly any reference to Frankl's personal journey or about how he evolved his theory and practices (that did transform many lives) based on his experiences.!121!There’s a joy at once fierce and quiet in feeling profoundly rearranged by your encounter with a book. In understanding, with certainty, in the deep core of your heart, that the you who first entered this book exists at a distance of several hundred pages: you’re not the same person, you’ve changed—been changed—in ways you cannot explain but which you will always carry with you. I might have finished this book but I feel like it’s only just begun me.Man’s Search for Meaning weaves together compelling personal narrative and profound scientific inquiry into a short volume that is luminous, insightful, and deeply empowering. Frankl provides us with an extraordinary investigation into his doctrine of Logotherapy, a branch of therapy that believes that “the primary motivational force” of a human being is the striving to find a meaning in his life.From the outset, Frankl makes it clear that he does not bring to this inquiry solely the tools of a scientist, but even more importantly, the weight of first-hand lived experience. The first part of this book recounts, intimately and horribly, Frankl’s experiences as a Jewish detainee in several Nazi concentration camps, illuminating in the process the key concepts of Frankl’s theory of Logotherapy.It is impossible to hide one’s wince reading this section. Frankl’s account is unsparing, giving an unflinching testimonial of humanity’s violence against itself, of “the hard fight for existence which raged among the prisoners,” of what it means to survive through unimaginable horror in places where one’s definition of suffering is deranged, every second, into entirely new meanings. (In a particularly haunting instance, Frankl remembers how he abruptly stopped himself from shaking a fellow inmate out of a fearful nightmare he was having because “no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him.”) To cushion himself against the shock and constant oppression of terror, Frankl remembers his wife’s face and the stolen manuscript containing his life’s work and feels empowered to survive long enough to fulfill his twin needs of seeing his wife and re-writing his manuscript. Frankl’s beloved and unwritten manuscript become, in other words, the marginal references for the survival of his self.  Frankl survives to speak the full agenda and unequivocal goal of his therapeutic doctrine— Logotherapy—which is explained and explored in the second part of this book. Frankl’s theory of Logotherapy, when reduced to its simplest form, is clear, precise, and easy to both grasp and appreciate: that “life holds meaning under any condition,” therefore the purpose of Logotherapy is for one to be “confronted with, reoriented towards the meaning of his life.” From this deceptive simplicity, however, arises a practice of meaning-making that is complex, challenging, unresolved, and ongoing.Throughout the book, Frankl insists upon the plural, specific, and shifting nature of the meaning of one’s life—as opposed to a unified, abstract, and generalized understanding of meaning-making. In other words, it is not so much a man’s search for a meaning, but for a multitude of meanings: a constantly changing constellation of potentialities, as opposed to a fixed quantity of traits. In this book, Frankl invites us to work out the vocabularies of our unwieldy selves, to make our own meaning(s) and walk through them. For him, this exercise is fraught with tension—the tension “between what one has already achieved and what one should become”—because tension is not only inevitable in the process of meaning-making—it is also “normal and healthy.” Frankl refuses to see this contradiction as conflicting: in his rendering, it is precisely this tension that prevents us from being embedded in misery and a freezing boredom. It is an amulet that protects us against the void that threatens to devour our selves, what Frankl calls the “existential vacuum.”Frankl identifies this void as a primary aspect of the atrophy of the imagination that precludes us from finding meaning in life and stresses how important it is to resist this void and to struggle openly and fiercely against it. To this end, Frankl delineates three broad avenues through which one might find meaning(s) “at any given moment”. The first is through personal achievement or a good deed. The second is through the embrace of beauty, culture, and nature and/or personal encounters with one another, in which we grapple for each other’s depths and love each other. The last one is through personal suffering.  Let me immediately admit that I was very resistant, for several pages, to this last point: to the idea that suffering enobles us, that our life and the meaning of it is enlivened  by it somehow. But Frankl, as it turns out, has anticipated this objection and hastens to explain that he isn’t making a case for suffering as something indispensable for or dissociable from the practice of meaning-making—that suffering is, to put it differently, a requisite for leading a meaningful life—but that meaning can come, not from suffering, but despite the abundance of it. It is difficult not to feel persuaded, and even liberated by this: the idea that not only can we survive through our suffering, but that we can live thoroughly within it. That even in the worst types of circumstances, through a rigorous and indefatigable striving for meaning, one can be transformed.  Here, Frankl brings us directly and inevitably against the question of how. How does one give meaning to one’s suffering when one’s subject, in their everyday life, to larger systemic forces that feel impossible to overcome? Frankl’s theory of Logotherapy does not deny that there are circumstances beyond our control, but it insists that there is one thing that we are able to control, which is “the way(s) in which we respond to (them).” What is available in the search for meaning, in other words, is the deepest kind of freedom. “It is not freedom from conditions,” to borrow Frankl’s words, “but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions.” The freedom one is born with, which is as inextricable from one’s self as a strand of DNA. The freedom to imagine an elsewhere and an otherwise, or as Frankl puts it, to imagine a present that is both past and future: “Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!” The principle of responsibleness is therefore integral to Frankl’s vision of freedom: the pursuit of meaning has the immense power to heal the fissures that suffering makes on the imagination—but only if we can first extend our imagination to articulate what we are responsible for.In its most radical moments, Man’ Search for Meaning speaks deeply to the human desire to mediate rupture and powerlessness and create ourselves through annihilation. It’s a testament to how humans have always evolved creative responses to rupture, crisis, and fissure, and how we manage to endure at the center of even the most unendurable atrocities. This is not a book one comes to for answers—Logotherapy is, in Frankl’s own words, “neither preaching nor teaching”—but rather, a book that one can approach as a way of being and thinking, as a way of conceiving of one’s self and the world, as something to hold consciously at the center of one’s practice. Ultimately, what Man’s Search for Meaning does best is posit a set of questions that become a ferocious call to action: to always strive for meaning—and to hunt for it when it’s necessary—even in a world that seems to perpetually corrode our freedom.!121!في رصيد قراءاتي السنوي تبزغ ثلاثة إلى أربعة كتب لتشكّل نقط ارتكاز؛ مكان أعود إليه ذهنيًا من أجل التشافي. هذا واحد من تلك الكتب التي تعيدك إلى العالم بعد تسليحك. لو لم يكن فيكتور فرانكل قد جرب الاعتقال في أربع معسكرات للنازية من بينها أوشفتز، لبدا كل ما كتبه من قبيل المثالية الكاذبة. لكنها ليست كذلك؛ فالمؤلف ابن التجربة، والقدرة على إيجاد معنى (حتى في قلب المعاناة) هو ما يحصّننا ضد السقوط في الفراغ الوجودي - وباء العصر وقبل الكورونا حتى.يقلب د. فرانكل الطاولة على منطق الضحية؛ فسؤال ""ما معنى الحياة"" لا يوجهه المرء لحياته، بل هو سؤال توجهه حياته إليه. إنه يؤكد بأن الإنسان ليس صنيعة ظروفه بالكامل (وإن كان يتأثر بها بنسبة كبيرة)، لكن الظروف نفسها تفرز ردود أفعال متفاوتة، وفي معسكر الاعتقال نفسه اختار البعض أن ينضموا للكابو ويتحولوا إلى جلادين، فيم اختار آخرون أن يُهدوا بعضهم كسرة خبز لم يكن لديهم غيرها.إن قدرة المرء على خلق معنى لحياته تعني أن يمرن نفسه باستمرار على تجاوز ذاته؛ أن ينظر إلى حياته من خلال جودة العلاقات التي تحيطها، ومن خلال قدرته على خلق الجمال ومنح المعرفة. يقول: ""كان علينا أن نعلم أنفسنا أنه لا يهم حقًا ما كنا نتوقعه من الحياة، بل ما تتوقعه الحياة منا"". يسقط فرانكل الضوء على العديد من أمراض عصرنا؛ إلى جانب الفراغ الوجودي طبعًا، لدينا المرض الآخر المتمثل في ربط قيمة الإنسان بفائدته. يجادل فرانكل بأن قيمة الإنسان مرتبطة بكرامته، وليس على مقدار ما يقدمه من فائدة.. وإلا أين الفرق بين هذه الفكرة وبين المنطق النازي؟المغالطة الأخرى هي البحث عن السعادة؛ لا يبحث المرء عن السعادة بل عن أسبابها، فالسعادة نتيجة جانبية وليست هدفًا. إنها مثل الضحك؛ لا يمكنك افتعاله. إن السعادة هي ثمرة جانبية لحياة مليئة بالمعاني.وختامًا، وكما صاغها فرانكل؛ ""منذ أوشفيتز نعرف ما يستطيع الإنسان أن يفعله، ومنذ هيروشيما نعرف ما هو على المَحك"". لدينا نسختنا الخاصة من أوشفيتز واسمها النكبة (يتحدث فرانكل أيضا عن تحول الضحية إلى جلاد)، ولدينا نسخة مصغرة من هيروشيما في انفجار بيروت، وكم هو وعرٌ وطويل.. هذا الطريق الذي علينا أن نأخذه من أجل المعنى. شكرًا للناشر على الكتاب المهم، وشكرًا عبدالمقصود عبدالكريم على الترجمة الأنيقة.!121!The original part one was the strongest I think because the rest started to go into the typical psychobabble inherent to books trying to contribute to the academic side of psychology or psychiatry but the first part really grounded the idea of giving meaning to one existence into personal experience and I found it very poignant about the mental state of people in very stressful and hopeless situations. It's a very empowering and important idea that no matter the situation a person can control their behavior and influence their own feelings of the situation. This idea of a person having so much control over their own selves and survival is one I whole heartedly agree with. Anyone having trouble figuring out life or what the point is could benefit from reading this I think.!121!If someone asks me to recommend the best three books related to the Second World War and the horrors of the holocaust, this book will be one among them. Viktor Emil Frankl was an Austrian Neurologist and Psychiatrist. He was also a Holocaust survivor. This book describes his experiences in concentration camps in the first section and the logotherapy he developed for finding meaning in all forms of existence during the suffering in the second section.
My favorite three lines from this book. 


 “Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.”


 ""But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer."" 


 “I do not forget any good deed done to me & I do not carry a grudge for a bad one.”

The way the author recalls all the events is simply brilliant. The hardships he faced in the concentration camp will indubitably shock you. I always wondered how he was able to survive three years in four concentration camps when I can't even think about living there for a single day. This is one of the most challenging books I read in my life so far. But I reread this book once in a while to remind me of the importance of hope and how it can help a human being to overcome one of the most harrowing experiences that humankind has ever witnessed on this planet. This is one of those books that everyone in this world should read at least once in their lifetime.!121!بسم الله الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ- اعترافات لا بدّ منها : 1- المراجعة طويلة نوعا ما .. و لا أدري لماذا صراحة ؟ و ما معنى أن تكون المراجعة طويلة ؟ 2- مستواي في علم النفس ضعيف جدا، لذلك تهت بين المصطلحات والمفاهيم النفسية وحاولت قدر الإمكان استيعابها وفهمها . 3- الشكر موصول للأخت هناء (تحديث: رحمها الله وغفر لها، ورزقها الفردوس الأعلى) فمراجعتها كانت السبب في اختيار هذا الكتاب . 4- لا أدري !!  عن الكاتب :  1- ولد الدكتور فكتور فرانكل في 26-03-1905 في فيينا، و توفي في 02-09-1997 . 2- طبيب أعصاب و طبيب نفسي . 3- من الذين عايشوا الحياة في المعتقلات النازية و عاشوا فيها . و أحد الناجبين من المحرقة النازية . 4- مؤسس و رائد العلاج بالمعنى، أو ما سمي بالمدرسة الفيينية الثالثة ( بعد مدرسة فرويد و مدرسة آدلر ) في التحليل النفسي .

Merci .Thank you .:D!121!Trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen: Ein Psychologe erlebt das Konzentrationslager = Man's Search for Meaning; an introduction to logotherapy, Viktor E. Frankl Man's Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as an Auschwitz concentration camp inmate during World War II, and describing his psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a purpose in life to feel positively about, and then immersively imagining that outcome. According to Frankl, the way a prisoner imagined the future affected his longevity. The book intends to answer the question ""How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?""

It begins with the author's experiences in four (!!) different German concentration camps in WWII, including Auschwitz, and how he coped with those experiences -- and saw others cope with them, or not. He continues in the second half of this book with a discussion of his approach to psychiatry, called logotherapy, based on the belief that each person needs to find something in his or her life, something particular and personal to them, to give their life meaning. We need to look outside ourselves. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is meaning in one's life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.""The first half of the book is completely absorbing, fascinating reading. When I tried to read the second, more academic part of it years ago, I floundered (I don't think I ever got through to the end). But I stuck with it this time and found it truly rewarding.The second part did sometimes challenge my brain cells with concepts like this:I never tire of saying that the only really transitory aspects of life are the potentialities; but as soon as they are actualized, they are rendered realities at that very moment; they are saved and delivered into the past, wherein they are rescued and preserved from transitoriness. For, in the past, nothing is irretrievably lost but everything is irrevocably stored.I had to read that one two or three times before I felt like I really grasped what Frankl was saying. And this one:Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!I assume it's to help give us motivation to avoid making a wrong choice, by thinking through the likely consequences of what we are about to do. But there are so many nuggets of wisdom in this short volume. A few things that really impacted me:We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated.It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. ... In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end.Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.Inspiring words; inspiring life.Bonus material: Here is an interview with Viktor Frankl when he was 90 years old. He died just a couple of years later.!121!I have to separate the emotional impact of the first half of the book from my overall impression on how effective the book was as a whole. It's really difficult not to find stories of the holocaust incredibly gripping, and the way in which Frankl speaks of his experience is inspiring and yet still maintains that gravity you'd expect from such a narrative.However, the latter half of the book delves much more into a psychological, and less personal, examination of 'logotherapy' (that is, the author's personal psychological theory). Once it became more of a text book with small sections reflecting on specific terms and theories, it was difficult to stay engaged. I also felt it lacked the cohesiveness that the first part of the book had with a more linear narrative structure.Nonetheless, the nuggets of wisdom I gleaned from this book were worth the reading. And I can only commend Frankl on his 'tragic optimism' in such a horrific environment as a Nazi concentration camp.!121!This book stands out as one of the most helpful tools I've found in my life-long search for the way to live and be useful to others despite depression. As opposed to Freud, who believed that the primary drive in man, the most urgent motivation, was pleasure, Frankl believes that it is meaning. Now meaning for Frankl is not something abstract and airy and noble but rather something very concrete and specific to your life - what is the task that life asks of you that only you can do? Look at the circumstances of your life, look at your talents and the people that surround you. Where is the need that is calling for you to respond? For Frankl, the hope that kept him trudging on day by day in the concentration camps was the need to re-write the manuscript (taken away when first imprisoned) where he could present to the world his theory of Logotherapy. Why I found this book so helpful in my struggles with depression is because one of the rock-bottom places where depression can take you is despair. Despair is the absence of hope. The search for meaning, for a response to something life is asking of you, is the place where hope is born. Frankl states that hope, like genuine laughter or like faith or love is not something that we can will into being. We cannot make hope appear willy nilly in our lives because hope is more than a nice thought, it is, like true love something that involves your whole being. I find this to be true but there are things that we can do to prepare the way for hope's arrival and hope will come, it will always come. We can search for meaning because searching and looking and asking and expecting are acts and attitudes that we can will. Meaning, according to Frankl is found in three different forms. Meaning is found in creating or doing. Meaning is found in experiencing something greater than ourselves and in encountering another being through love. And finally, meaning can be found in the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The important thing here is that in all of these instances the value of the thing that gives meaning is subjective. There is no scale out there that says that writing a novel gives more meaning than helping your spouse with the dishes. When it comes to meaning, the small, the hidden, the unsaid is as important as the great acts of genius and you alone are the judge. Orienting yourself to responding in some way to what life is asking of you may not be the sole cure to depression but it is for me a necessary part of any healing process, of learning to live and be useful, despite the illness.!121!I never thought the book would actually deal with psychiatry, neuroses and some basic mental health issues.The book just ended.Did it just end? Like end?!I was so enjoying the concepts and the writing.Loved the later half of the book more. Actually O should not compare as it is almost like the author is trying to present those days at concentration camps in the first part and in the second part, how his concept of logotherapy/various mental disorders/physiological health issues should be dealt with.This book is so informative and insightful from a very practical point of view, historically relevant and quite helpful from a medical point of view.It helps that the author is from the said field and he just wrote everything important in such a concise manner that you just cannot afford to skip a word.I have less information about concentration camps or the history behind it. But yes, this book is like 80 percent more than that.This is not a story of survival or a description of how the author suffered during those days. Of course, suffering was there. And oh, how the author described suffering in a new light attached to the meaning of life!I really loved the writing.This book is going to help me in both my personal as well as my profession.This book will remain next to me. If I were to annotate this book, I would have to just highlight each and every sentence of part two of the book.I will definitely reread this book. Because life's meaning isn't constant. And yes, I need that motivation and life's understanding as discussed in this short book.Amazing!*There's so much more to this book regarding the camp inmates; discussion on the psychology of prisoners; it not only handles about life issues on just all the issues mentioned before but also about life in general - family and various human needs and emotions.*Love the parts where he talked about his wife. Loved it so much!Thanks to my Instagram buddies who recommended this book at one of my recent posts.Definitely loving taking recommendations ❤️!121!I enjoyed reading Part One and I felt a bit bored when I read Part Two.Overall, this is one of the best books to tell the living experience in the WWII concentration camp in Auschwitz where there are horrible places such as gas chambers, crematoriums, and massacres.They can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.I would also like to recommend ""The Happiest Man on Earth by Eddie Jaku."" if you like this book.!121!""no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.""""Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.""Man's Search for Meaning provides an unbiased narration of the experiences faced by a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the effects of it on one's most inner self. This is not a book on the specifics of torture, or other such inhumane things, but a prisoner's psychological impacts caused from numerous hardships. ""No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.""Dr. Frankl incorporates his own experiences while trying to find common ground among the prisoners and how one must survive when all else is lost. The first autobiographical section is followed by an evaluation of the adapted methodology, in which the author clearly describes the fundamentals of the basics and specifics on this school of thought. This is a very unique interpretation as to how a man should live, while allowing reader to relate his own experiences and to see life in a different perspective.""at any time each of the moments of which life consists is dying, and that moment will never recur. And yet is not this transitoriness a reminder that challenges us to make the best possible use of each moment of our lives?""!121!داشتم فکر می کردم که دنیا با وجود این همه وحشی گری هنوز هم میتونه جای قشنگی برای آدم ها باشه. اما دوست دارم زمانی که این مساله رو به عنوان یه باور به زبون میارم ، اون آدمی باشم که تصوری واقعی از زشتی دنیا داره و اون نیمه ی تاریک زندگی رو هم لمس کرده بخونید این کتاب رو ، حتما بخونید. حداقل چیزی که ازش بدست می آرید اینه که متوجه میشین انسان ها در بدترین شرایط روحی و جسمی شون باز هم قادر به ادامه دادن زندگی هستند. اینکه معنای زندگی هامون فراتر از شکست خوردن و به آسانی تسلیم شدن هست، و اینکه هست��د انسان هایی که با لمس سیاه ترین نیمه ی این دنیا هنوز به وجود زیبایی هاش معتقدن!121!لابد أنك قابلت بعضهم!من مروا بتجارب قاسية:إفلاس عَقِب ثراءقسوة البشرعلاقة فاشلةمكوث في السجنمَرض مُقعدأصيبوا باضطرابات نفسية أشد بطشًا من الظروف التي مروا بها:اكتئاب مرضيارتياب ووسوسةاضطراب ثنائي القطبيةخوف غير منطقيمالم تحصن نفسيتك من الداخل، فستهشم مطارق الحياة زجاج روحك بشكل يستعصي على الإصلاح.يتمترس البعض خلف الإيمان، بينما تغرق ثلةٌ في العمل، يرتمي القليل في أحضان الحب فيما يتلجئ الآخرون إلى بيت العائلة.كلما سبق أدرجه الدكتور فرانكل تحت مسمى (المعنى)، فالمعنى –من وجهة نظره- هو مايحمي الإنسان من الإنكسار في الأوقات العصيبة.ينقسم الكتاب إلى قسمين، يروي في القسم الأول جانبًا من تجربته في معتقل أوشيفتز النازي في سياق بحث الإنسان عن المعنى. وفي القسم التالي يشرح أطروحاته حول العلاج النفسي باستخدام المعنى مستلهما تجربته في المعتقل وتجاربه مع مرضى وأصدقاء.أفَضل هنا ألّا أذكر ما يحتويه الكتاب بل ما ليس فيه، كي أزيل عن القارئ المحتمل بعض الأفكار المُسبقة التي قد تثنيه عن قراءته:هذا الكتاب:1-	لا يندرج تحت لائحة تطوير الذات. فهو يخلو من النصائح المباشرة، والخطوات التي يُنصح باتباعها والجداول والخطط وكل ذلك الدجل الأنيق الوارد في بعض كتب التطوير الشخصي.2-	لا يستغل معاناة المعتقلين للدعاية الدينية أو السياسية.3-	ليس أكاديميًا محضًا وإن احتوى على بعض المصطلحات الثقيلة، وليس قصصيًا صِرفًا، بل يستخدم القصص لدعم نظرية معينة في علم النفس.4-	ليس مخصصًا لكل من داهمه اليأس أو الضنك فحسب بل لكل من ينشد الصحة النفسية والتأمل في تقلبات هذه الدنيا وتأثيرها على بني البشر.كتاب قيّم ومميز. أحب الكتب التي تطرح علم النفس بشكل مفهوم، وهي نادرة على قدر علمي.!121!Firește, Viktor Emil Frankl (1905 - 1997) nu și-a propus să ofere (încă) o relatare a anilor petrecuți în lagăr de un inocent, ci o meditație asupra individului captiv și a transformărilor suferite de psihicul său. Poți să fii de acord (sau nu) cu ideile sale, dar ele provin dintr-o experiență-limită, asupra căreia autorul a meditat îndelung. Chiar dacă a dictat în nouă zile prima parte a cărții, Viktor Frankl a urmat, cu siguranță, o serie de note și „sistematizări”. Autorul încearcă să întemeieze o concluzie - viața are sens - și din această pricină nu urmează cronologia și nici nu descrie amănunțit toate suferințele prin care a trecut: nu dă nume, oferă o perspectivă de sus, austeră. Observă că, de obicei, psihicul captiv trece prin trei stadii. Uluirea inițială, revolta pot duce la o stare de apatie („Nu mai are nici un rost să trăiesc, moartea e preferabilă”) sau, în cazuri izolate, la intuirea sensului ascuns pînă și în suferința cea mai atroce. Firește, sensul nu e ceva valabil pentru toți, ceva ce ți se impune de sus, sensul vieții ține de o decizie strict personală: „Tovarășii mei de lagăr se temeau să ia decizii sau să aibă orice fel de inițiativă... Prizonierul prefera să lase soarta să aleagă în locul său” (pp.70-71).Pentru a-și păstra echilibrul mintal, prizonierul poate încerca o serie de „exerciții spirituale”, în tradiția celor prescrise cîndva de Ignatiu de Loyola. Cel mai important dintre ele este neîndoielnic vizualizarea minuțioasă a persoanei iubite (în cazul lui Frankl a fost Mathilde / Tilly Grosser, prima lui soție). O variantă a acestui exercițiu e vizualizarea unui eveniment fericit din viitor:„Mă scîrbisem de starea aceea de lucruri care mă constrîngea, zi de zi şi ceas de ceas, să mă gîndesc doar la astfel de lucruri mărunte. Mi-am silit gîndurile să treacă la un alt subiect. Brusc, m-am văzut stînd în picioare într-o sală de conferințe bine luminată, caldă şi plăcută. În faţa mea, un public atent şedea pe nişte scaune tapiţate, confortabile. Ţineam o prelegere despre psihologia lagărelor de concentrare” (p.86).Reflecțiile lui Frankl nu sînt niciodată confortabile. Citez cel mai provocator pasaj:„Noi, cei care am trăit în lagărele de concentrare, ne amintim de aceia care treceau din baracă în baracă, mîngîindu-i pe ceilalţi, dăruindu-le ultima lor îmbucătură de pîine. Vor fi fost puţini la număr, dar ei ne dau îndeajuns de multe dovezi că omului i se poate lua totul, mai puţin un lucru: ultima dintre libertăţile umane - respectiv aceea de a-și alege propria atitudine într-un anumit set de împrejurări date, de a-și alege propriul mod de a fi... La o ultimă analiză, ne devine limpede că genul de persoană care ajungea să devină deţinutul era rezultatul unei decizii lăuntrice, nu doar rezultatul influenţelor lagărului asupra sa” (p.79).Găsim aici cîteva sugestii foarte asemănătoare cu cele formulate de Sartre în 1943: omul e obligat mereu să aleagă, refuzul alegerii e tot o alegere, noi înșine alegem să fim liberi (sau nu). De noi depinde să fim bestii sau sfinți... Sigur că aceste opinii sînt discutabile: nu cred că viața are sens și nu cred că „voința de sens” conduce negreșit la sens, dar asta e o altă poveste...!121!""This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events but of personal experiences, experiences which millions of prisoners have suffered time and again. It is the inside story of a concentration camp, told by one of its survivors.""This book deals with history, psychology, and philosophy. It is about human suffering and the light of hope that shines even in the darkest times. Victor Frankl survived Nazi concentration camps. His experiences would enable him to develop his psychological theories aimed at helping people. As a survivor, Frankl recounts what helped him keep going while facing many harrowing situations in the camps. According to the author, feeling that life has meaning and having a sense of purpose, no matter what it is, is essential. One has to expect something from the future in order to endure cruelty and injustice.Those prisoners who knew why they should stay alive were more likely to survive. Losing the meaning of life was dangerous. Victor tells about one man who died almost immediately after his reason for surviving was invalidated. Shattered hopes can be very dangerous as well.The author wanted to live for he dreamt of finishing the text he had been working on. His manuscript had been confiscated upon his arrival in the concentration camp. Frankl was trying to find ways to somehow restore it.Helping his fellow prisoners was one of the things that added a certain meaning to seemingly meaningless suffering. By comforting others you can improve your own mental state. The author tries to empathize with different situations in which prisoners may find themselves and not pass judgment on them. Sacrifice has a meaning, according to Frankl, and human kindness can be found everywhere.This work also touches on the psychology of the prisoner who has been released. At first, the new freedom seems unreal to them, ""as in a dream.""The book made me look at the notion of life's purpose from a different angle. I have always been thinking that the meaning of life is life itself.However, sometimes something more substantial is needed. As Frankl points out, having some visible goal could mean the world to him and his fellow prisoners. It allowed them to remain humans in dehumanizing circumstances when people turned on people without mercy.I can only admire a man who went through hell and was nevertheless able to preserve his inner strength and integrity. Victor's resilience, stoic attitude to pain, and faith in humankind fascinate me. Much wisdom can be found in some of his observations. That being said, Frankl's philosophy, in which his religious beliefs played a big part, did not always resonate with me. I did not always agree with what he was saying.Here are a few quotes to end this review.""From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two—the 'race' of the decent man and the 'race' of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of 'pure race'—and therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the camp guards.""""The rift dividing good from evil, which goes through all human beings, reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the concentration camp.""""When we are no longer able to change a situation—just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer—we are challenged to change ourselves.""""Therefore, it was necessary to face up to the full amount of suffering, trying to keep moments of weakness and furtive tears to a minimum. But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.""!121!After the Book of Mormon, this would be my second recommendation to anyone looking for purpose in life. Here's a poignant excerpt from one of my favorite parts of the book when Frankl has been in Auschwitz and other camps for several years and doesn't know the war is only weeks away from ending. He had decided to escape his camp near Dachau with a friend and was visiting some of his patients for the last time.""I came to my only countryman, who was almost dying, and whose life it had been my ambition to save in spite of myself, but my comrade seemed to guess that something was wrong (perhaps I showed a little nervousness). In a tired voice he asked me, 'You too, are getting out?' I denied it, but I found it difficult to avoid his sad look. After my round I returned to him. Again a hopeless look greeted me and somehow I felt it to be an accusation. The unpleasant feeling that had gripped me as soon as I had told my friend I would escape with him became more intense. Suddenly I decided to take fate into my own hands for once. I ran out of the hut and told my friend that I could not go with him. As soon as I had told him with finality that I had made up my mind to stay with my patients, the unhappy feeling left me. I did not know what the following days would bring, but I had gained an inward peace that I had never experienced before. I returned to the hut, sat down on the boards at my countryman's feet and tried to comfort him...""I found such strength and wisdom in this book--strength and advice for me as a mother of six young children. While potty training, bending over to clean up a handful of toys for the the thousandth time that day, scraping Play Dough off of a filthy kitchen floor on hands and knees, and preparing the fifth snack of the day for several hungry mouths (directly after doing the dishes from the previous snack) I find the text of this book to give profound meaning to small and simple acts of selflessness, patience, and service. What a profound reminder that ""The immediate influence of behavior is always more effective than that of words."" I desperately needed to read this book, if only to remember to be calm and kind to my little ones so that they will pass on the favor to their own next generation. Bravo to Viktor Frankl for bringing human frailty and greatness into perspective.""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."" -Frankl!121!Pentru prima mea carte de psihologie este un rating foarte mare. A contat mult momentul in care am citit-o, pentru ca aveam nevoie de ea. M-a facut sa constientizez ca este important optimismul in orice moment prin care trecem in viata.

Cuando lo leí, estuve el día completo pensando en el libro y en sus historias, y de pasada, quiero interiorizarme un poco en lo que es la logoterapia.Le puse 3 estrellas porque es un libro tipo motivacional y esos definitivamente no son mi estilo. La verdad es que no me gusta leer mucho de esto, precisamente porque es triste, pero lo leí porque tenía curiosidad al ser un libro tan nombrado y no me arrepiento de haberlo leído en absoluto.Totalmente recomendable.!121!One of the first of Viktor Frankl's books that transformed my thinking and my world view. Man cannot survive without hope, and hope cannot survive feelings of futility or meaninglessness. We must therefore move away from despair and negativity and look for meaning in our suffering, or grow from it and find a different path. Everyone should read this book.Lately, I have been evaluating Frankl's messages about Love, that: ""Love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire"" and ""Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him"". As Eleanor Roosevelt pointed out, many of us are afraid to fully ""love"" - we fear being being exposed to hurt. If, as I have come to conclude, there is Yin and Yang in all things, then there is joy and suffering even in the state of love. To open ourselves to love, therefore, requires courage and acceptance of both states. So perhaps we should be taught to be courageous first, to be more fearless. Maybe then we would be more open to the inevitable pain as well as joys of love?!121!I’ve been meaning to read this for a very long time, but have to admit that the idea of reading a book by someone who survived the Holocaust with long descriptions of that part of their life included with graphic detail didn’t really make me want to jump at the chance. And this book is harrowing – particularly the first half or so – the pain is infinite. I was also keen to find out what he felt he learnt from this experience about how to live a good life. I have to say that I found this part of the book quite unsatisfying. His discussion of ‘logotherapy’ left me cold, I’m afraid. I don’t really like books that say things that amount to – this guy came to see me about some problem that had plagued his life for decades, I said three sentences to him and he went away with a skip and a spring in his step. There are bits of this that are worthwhile – you know, suffering isn’t an ‘and also’ in life, but often learning how to live with (rather than overcome) suffering is our key task. Yes, I think the Buddha said something similar. That life is better with a meaning is also hardly novel either, although, I guess not something the Buddha said, so much. Psychology is a subject that inevitably stresses the position of the individual, and the psychology of a man who has lived through an experience where those with power held his life in utter contempt and enjoyed making it clear to him that his ongoing existence was completely at their discretion would hardly encourage him to seek meaning in ‘grand projects’ and such. But I don’t really like psychology and worry it gazes wistfully down the wrong end of the telescope. I feel awful writing this review, by the way. It feels disrespectful to criticise a book written by someone who lived through something so utterly unimaginable and disgusting. But this is a book providing advice on how one should live one’s life – and even though people tend to think that having lived through the unspeakable is qualification enough to write such a book, I find I can’t really agree. As he makes too clear, sometimes we can look into the abyss and learn nothing from it at all. What he has learnt is better than what some of his fellow prisoners learnt, but if anything this book should be a reminder that someone forced to live through the banality of evil isn’t really under obligations to learn cuddly and life-affirming lessons from that experience. All to the good if that is what you do learn – but it does seem to compound the punishment of such an experience if such ‘lessons’ become mandatory.!121!While reading Man's Search for Meaning, I could not stop thinking: why can't I be a psychologist now? By the time I reached page 103, I wanted to highlight passage after passage, or at least add them to my favorite quotes on Goodreads to preserve their impact forever.Frankl divides his inspiring book into two parts. The first describes his experience living in Nazi death camps and how he dealt with the doom and decay that always surrounded him. He laces his story with astute, dispassionate observations about his emotions and the suffering of those around him. The second section explores a type of therapy that arose from his time in the death camps: logotherapy. Logotherapy focuses on helping people find meaning in their lives, to give them a greater sense of purpose and to push them past the obstacles they face. He writes that people can discover meaning in three different ways: 1) by creating a work or doing a deed, 2) by experiencing something or encountering someone, and 3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (this last option is only meaningful when the first two are unavailable).Overall, I would recommend this book to those interested in psychology, or those who want to read an inspiring tale by someone who survived the Nazi death camps and used his experience to transcend himself. Frankl veers into the spiritual side in the second portion of the book, which might perturb a few people, but for the most part he keeps his ideas open to everyone. For the rest of the review I'm just going to write down all of the book because it was so good a few of the quotes about logotherapy that stood out to me, so I can reference them later on. Feel free to read or skip.(about man and meaning) ""As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by becoming responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.""(about transcending the self) ""By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic 'the self-transcendence of human existence.' It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.""(about how we mistakenly use money and sex to replicate meaning) ""Moreover, there are various masks and guises under which the existential vacuum appears. Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will is meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.""Of course I would love to include a few more passages, but I want to avoid writing down the entire book. Perhaps I will purchase a copy, then.!121!TO COMPOSE a brief synthesis of Viktor Frankl’s lucid insights on a prisoner’s self-transcendence over the inhumanity of the Holocaust is the purpose of this brief essay.From 1941 until 1945, the Jews were held captive and systematically massacred in the concentration camps under the Nazi territories. The covert methods of this genocide included starvation, heavy manual labor under severe conditions, torture, hanging in the gallows, then mass murders, gas chambers, and crematoriums—methods that, by the final stages of the war, had already decimated approximately 11 million people.Upon captivity, all possessions were taken away from the prisoners, names replaced by numbers, not a strand of hair left unshaven on their bodies. They were forced to toil like animals, despite their serious malnourishment, and slumber in abominably small bunk beds like stacks of corpses.Nothing was left of the prisoners’ lives but their hope for liberation and their nakedness to the inevitability of death surrounding them. But amid the gamut of terrors, for three years, Frankl, who was a psychiatrist before the occupation, investigated the camp’s psychology and secretly jotted down notes on scraps of paper that served as the manuscript for his own psychotherapeutic theory: that is logotherapy (logos is Greek for meaning).In his book Man’s Search for Meaning—an autobiography about his Holocaust experience and an introduction to the concepts of logotherapy—Frankl postulated that “the sort of person a prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, not the result of the camp influences alone.”Numerous prisoners, after recognizing the impossibility of surviving under the camp’s environment, either ran into the electrically charged fences to commit suicide or simply awaited death to come over their beds. They found no meaning in prolonging their unjustifiable suffering.But Frankl observed there were a few prisoners who “never lost their ideals in the depths of degradation” and possessed a humor that offered necessary self-detachment and reprieve from the conditions. They endured their suffering honorably and remained as though undaunted in the face of the camp’s thoroughly abject reality.These odd behaviors, however small in number, Frankl concluded, suffice as proof that the “work of choosing” and the “will to meaning” become the “soul’s weapon in the fight for self-preservation.” As long as there is a deep sense of meaning that fortifies the spirit, an individual can suffer without despair and not become subject to decay.Logotherapy presupposes that man’s inherent will to meaning and freedom of choice are the authors to his own personality: “Man is more than psyche. […] Man is a self-determining being, man decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.”The antithesis of surrendering to the machinery of the base instincts is the discipline of making conscious decisions in each moment. Between stimulus and response is a space of freedom that is solely determined by the individual’s volition.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Classics']"
Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood (Hardcover),Trevor Noah,4.49,686300,2016,"The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.","I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I was really surprised when Trevor Noah was named Jon Stewart's successor on 
The Daily Show
. I inherently knew that they wouldn't pick someone with a sense of humor and style identical to Stewart's, but I felt that Noah was so different that his selection meant the show would have a really different feel, which might not appeal to long-time fans of the show. But I always root for the underdog, so as he was getting savaged by critics and fans in his first few days on the job, I kept hoping he'd be able to tough it out and show the stuff—comedic and otherwise—of which he was made.After reading 
Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood
, I realize that I needn't have worried about Trevor Noah. For a child growing up in South Africa in the last days of, and the tumult following apartheid, he faced crises far greater than dissatisfied fans. And if he could be raised during such a crazily illogical time in a country where more violence, racism, and mistreatment went unreported than caught the media's eye, he'd have no problem skewering the insanity of our political system, especially leading into the election of 2016!!""On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations—I was born a crime.""Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah literally spent his earliest days hiding indoors. His parents, who never married, couldn't be seen together, and because his mother looked so different than he did, she couldn't walk through the streets with him, because at any moment someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person's child. Yet while their lives dealt with crushing poverty, violence, and racism from all sides, his deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or stop her from raising her son to know he was loved, and to know that he truly could accomplish anything he wanted, despite all of the obstacles in his way.""She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.""
Born a Crime
 provides a first-hand account of the last days of apartheid and its aftermath, and what it was like to grow up as a mixed-race child, where he wasn't white enough to be considered white, nor was he black enough to be considered black. While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave.If you go into this book expecting to laugh hysterically because of Noah's day job, think again. While the book does include some of the wry humor that has begun endearing him to fans, this is an emotional, brutal, and educational story of a life which flourished despite the odds stacked against it. This is a book about growing up in a culture of poverty and crime, and how easy it was to get caught up in that, especially when it was one of the only ways to make money and be able to feed, clothe, and enjoy yourself. It's also a book about fear, how it motivates you, how it paralyzes you, and how it threatens to take away the one thing you cherish more than any other.More than anything, though, this is a book about the unwavering love of a mother for a child she chose to have. She knew it would be difficult raising her son in the age of apartheid, and in fact, she had no idea when he was born that it would end anytime soon. But Noah was a remarkable child, and while he exasperated, frightened, and upset his mother from time to time, she knew he would accomplish great things one day (as soon as he stopped putting cornrows in his hair and hanging out with those awful hoodlums he called friends).I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn't know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I've heard him deliver his lines on 
The Daily Show
. This is a funny, thought-provoking, and emotional book, although I felt that some of his anecdotes went on a little too long, while others didn't go on long enough. I also would have liked to have learned how he went from his upbringing in South Africa to one day hosting an acclaimed television show—other than passing mentions of things he did, I have no idea how he made the leap.I've heard some people say that the audio version of this book is brilliant because Noah reads it himself, but if you read the print/digital version, you can still hear his voice through his words. Noah's story is a lesson of the inequities of the past, and a warning for what is still possible to happen again in our world. But this isn't heavy-handed; it's fun, insightful, and very compelling.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo..., and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2016.html.!121!This was fantastic.Born a Crime, at over six months, is the longest library hold I've ever waited for. Normally, if I hadn't already lost interest by that point, I'd just break down and buy it, but I'm generally not a big memoir reader, so I was reluctant to spend money on a book I wasn't sure would be my thing. Well, I've ended up buying it anyway. And my husband and I are currently laughing our way through the audio version, too.I just couldn't put this book down. There are many moments of comedy gold (that come across even better on audio, but still drew out-loud laughter when I read them in print) and lots of insight into what it was like growing up in South Africa under the later years of apartheid, and after its collapse (which I prefer reading in print so I can take my time to appreciate the gravity of the issues).Trevor Noah covers a lot of serious issues like colonialism, apartheid, being an outsider, religion, education, gender roles and more. He talks about how his mother - who comes across as the rugged heroine of his story - played the system well to get her illegal ""colored"" child into better schools and neighborhoods, and how this often led to him having difficulty fitting in. I learned things that, though perhaps not surprising, were horrifying, such as how police refused to file charges in cases of domestic violence because they sympathized with the husband. It's a book about important issues in a country that has, throughout history, largely been portrayed through the eyes of white journalists and writers, but it's also such a warm, lovable, funny book in many ways. Born a Crime is the perfect blend of sociopolitical discussion and a personal tale of family, friendship and first crushes. It is written as a series of short essays, each around a certain theme and not in chronological order, but this actually makes it all easier to digest. Noah's writing is so engaging that I would think ""just one more essay"" until suddenly a hundred pages had gone by and I realized I might be addicted.Definitely one of the best memoirs I've ever read.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube!121!These stories, beautifully written, are set in a world quite like our own but at the same time utterly different. Maybe ""through a glass darkly"". Who goes to church three times on Sunday to Black, White and Coloured ones? Who goes to jail for (not) stealing a car rather than face the wrath of his mother? Who gets a prom date with the most beautiful girl around, but one who doesn't speak the language and is extremely unsociable to boot? None of these things are extraordinary in this world,Who could perform rap at a Jewish school to a wildly-enthusiastic audience and create deadening silence in one second asking respect for Hitler? Repeatedly. I'm not going to spoil this one. It's a brilliant story, very funny, and sadly critical too. Two worlds collide, black and white, and neither understand why the other is so offended. If you'd really like to know and aren't going to read the book, IM me.In what world can a man standing in front of a policeman not be identified on the video they are both watching of his best friend shoplifting and he with him? But he isn't. Because of the exposure of the video the black figure appeared black but the coloured one, Trevor, appeared white. The police were unable to link in their heads the features of the man on the screen with the one in front of them who was a suspect, because he was white. These South African policemen were blinded by their prejudice. Which was rather lucky for Trevor, and he is our hero.He's mine anyway. This is a fascinating book that will take you deep into the world of the non-white life of South Africa mostly since apartheid ended. It's funny and tragic, heart-warming and wtf did you do that for. It's tribal and urban and mostly very third world. It's quite something to incorporate all those elements and boast only in ways that are more to do with accomplishment than with ego. But if you don't like politics this isn't for you. Every single incident no matter how funny, how light, and they aren't all, drives home that race decides everything in South Africa.  I listened to it in the car. The audio is brilliant. narrated by the author (which is why I got it on audio, that's one of the great advantages of the media listening to an author tell his own tale.) It's a 10-star biography.!121!If you're going to read this book, definitely listen to the audio version. Trevor Noah is one of the most effortless narrators I've ever listened to. It genuinely feels like he is sitting down with you and telling you his life story. Not only that, but you get to learn quite a bit about pre- and post-Apartheid South Africa from the perspective of someone who hypothetically shouldn't exist. Noah's mother is black and his father is white, and when he was born any mixed-race relationships were illegal. I was instantly intrigued by his story, not only because of this unique perspective but also because he is such a wonderful storyteller.I do think the chronology of the book was a bit strange at times—one chapter would be from his childhood and then the next would jump to his teen years, and back. And at the end of each chapter there was always a short snippet that completely changed directions and had pretty much nothing to do with the previous chapter (maybe in the physical copy of the book that section is identifiably set apart?).Nonetheless, this was a great listening experience, one that was enlightening, hilarious, heartbreaking, frustrating and well told. Would highly recommend.!121!Before I start my review, I want to take a minute to praise Trevor Noah's stand up shows because they're one of the few that don't rely on being ignorant. His shows are one of the enlightened ones focusing on race, white-privilege, police brutality, hate speech, prejudice, and so much more.I’d highly recommend watching a few before reading this riveting memoir.

In Born a Crime, Trevor Noah takes us on a journey from his childhood being born a crime in apartheid South Africa. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. This memoir is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.Side note: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - his mother - was a powerhouse, a strong woman in every sense. She's a warrior and I only wish I could be a half of the person she is. Also, I love the advice she gave her son—I even wrote a few pieces down to remember:��Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”This passage had pretty much changed the way I think, the way I perceive the world.“She’d tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by: “If God is with me, who can be against me?” She was never scared. Even when she should have been.”The piece stuck with me.Truly though, this memoir was enlighten, brimming with emotion, and I love it when children pay tribute to their hard-working mothers.“There was no stepfather in the picture yet, no baby brother crying in the night. It was me and her, alone. There was this sense of the two of us embarking on a grand adventure. She’d say things to me like, “It’s you and me against the world.” I understood even from an early age that we weren’t just mother and son. We were a team.”My mind and heart were fully transported while reading everything Trevor went through to get to where he is today and everyone that took part of that journey.And even though some of the stories kind of broke my heart, Trevor Noah always managed to bring in his gold humor to ease the tension. There are a couple of chapters that have taken a hold of my soul and won’t let go because either they were extremely hilarious (TREVOR, PRAY & LOOPHOLES) or entirely heart-shattering (MY MOTHER’S LIFE)... or both.Slowly and surely, I came to admire Trevor Noah's character and honesty even more than I did before. And I'm pretty sure that I'll end up watching and rewatching his stand-up shows so that I can stop tearing up at the mention of his name.ARC kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.5/5 stars*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

This review and more can be found on my blog.!121!4.5/5Trevor Noah was a great narrator and had the ability to turn the grimmest of experiences into smart, exciting stories. If this book interests you, I urge you to listen to the audiobook!It was fascinating learning about his life growing up as a mixed race child in pre- and post-Apartheid South Africa. Though I learned vague facts about Apartheid in high school history classes, this was the best lesson I've had on the subject.The book skips around non-chronologically, which confused me at times as he introduces aspects of his earlier years later on in the story, but I remained captivated. I was so into it that, instead of working on the paper that's due soon or studying for my upcoming exam, I read this book in less than 24 hours. Worth it!I will say that this probably could have been a tad shorter as he has the tendency to repeat and over explain aspects, but I highly enjoyed it nonetheless.!121!#BlackLivesMatter
“I soon learned that the quickest way to bridge the race gap was through language.”
Where do I even begin to explain how incredible this autobiography was?!Trevor Noah brought this story to life, but ultimately, it was his mother that was the main character, the MVP, of this book.Trevor Noah is narrating his account on being raised in Apartheid South Africa. (I look at that word and cannot fathom the audacity of it. It existed.) The issues growing up as a mixed-race child and a mother who defied all societal standard and called bullshit before anyone even dared do it. Colonialism. Poverty. Race. Living under a police state. Privilege. Whilst reading, I was aware these kind of ludicrous laws existed, but it still managed to shock me all over again. This was a world where interracial marriage/relationships was banned. Where Trevor could not be seen with either his mother or father. Where white people were put on such a pedestal, his grandmother refused to discipline him, because she ‘didn’t want to kill a white person’ as he was ‘white-passing.’Where animosity was purposely sowed between people so the whites could be looked at for help. Yet, the blacks could never dream of getting to that social status and would be denied at every turn even though the ‘American Dream’ was dangled in front of them. Though his world was completely different from our own, Trevor Noah still managed to make it relatable. His relationship with his mother was a delight to read. His desperation to fit in called to others. His first kiss. Trying to take the most beautiful girl to prom. Everything going disastrously wrong and beautifully twining that with wisdom and lessons that he learned along the way. I just became enamoured with his mother though. The strength she possessed was almost not human. I‘m pretty sure it’s not human. Her faith played a massive part in solidifying her personality and how she viewed the world and it was incredible to see her overcome troubles that would make others crumble with humour, love and Jesus. Trevor Noah is honestly a gem. We have his mother to thank for that. I highly recommend the audiobook for this. I didn’t even touch the book once and it gave me hope in trying other audiobooks. It was completely engaging story, intimate, heartbreaking and provided you a front-seat view into Apartheid and what it did to the lives of others. I cannot wait for the movie adaptation!!121!An audiobook *treasure*! Trevor is a likable! A charming- guy!!! Listening to him speak is almost magnetic. Being thrown out of a car? By his own mother? OUCH! Trevor had my attention in the palm of his hands. The ongoing - ongoing - and ONGOING ....dramatic stories Trevor shares about his childhood --were life lesson building blocks. Trevor did the building!! He used every life experience to his advantage-- and that's extraordinary! Poverty, abuse, Religious upbringing, crazy chaotic living conditions, a powerhouse one-of-kind mother....Trevor is a thriving survivor!!!!We also get an excellent intimate understanding: .....of the rigid former policy of segregating and economically and politically oppressing the non-white population....from the direct experience of Noah being born in South Africa during the laws of apartheid.A child who was often guided to play indoors, ( hiding), a 'positive' lifetime result 'today' is that Trevor says he can sit and enjoy his own company for days on out. He is never bored!.... sadness of course - tragic times -horrific injustice.....but Trevor Noah is warm - charming -filled with love and light!!!! Funny too!!!!121!4.5* This is my 2nd attempt to read this memoir and I am glad I failed to pass the 2nd chapter the 1st time. I got so much more out of it now. I decided to buy the ebook a few years ago because of all the praise but I did not know who the author was so I could not feel connected with his story. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, I started to watch stand-up comedy because I needed an escape from all the fear and gloom. Trevor Noah soon became one of my favourite comedians; I watched his 2 Netflix specials and also followed The Daily Show on a regular basis. I enjoyed his humour because we both have a love for languages and different cultures. I did not know then that it was a survival skill he had to learn to be accepted. I also realised that in order to fully appreciate the book, I had to listen to it as narrated by the author. That is what I did and it was the best decision ever. My advice is to listen to the audiobook and listen to some of his comedy before. Yes, the book is funny but it is so much more. It is a book about Trevor’s love for his mother even the relationship was sometimes intense, It’s a book about being poor and colored in Apartheid South Africa and its aftermath, it is a book about survival, about race, crime, religion, politics, the condition of women. It also a book about the adventures of an African childhood. This memoir was excellent, charming, funny and sometimes sad, it made me angry of the injustice black and colored people had to suffer. I like Trevor even more after listening to him narrating this memoir. Highly recommended.!121!The author is very charismatic and if you're going to read this book, I would recommend the audiobook since he narrates it!!121!When he took over from John Stewart I'll admit I stopped watching TDS; however, intermittently, I would come across Trevor's comedy shows online which would have me doubling over fighting for air (watch the ""Australian apple"" and ""Escalator"" skits), and within a short period, I became an even more ardent fan of TDS.In my opinion, Trevor is one of the most intelligent people on TV (or elsewhere) and this book shows us how he became the astute, authentic, resilient and insightful person that he now is. As an aside, special shout out to his Ma, Patricia, whom I understand will be played by Lupita in the upcoming movie adaptation, and while I like Lupita enough, I believe she is unsuited for this role as she herself must well know. South African women have a certain look which is def not Lupita and it would be a shame for Trevor to cede control of casting simply because she was the first person to contact him about movie options. Just saying.Overall,  Born a Crime is an important piece of literature that provides a young man's view of the effects of apartheid, the family dynamic that devolved from being born a crime, and the power of a mother's love.!121!“Language, even more than color, defines who you are to people.” Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood ~~ Trevor NoahTrevor Noah's BORN A CRIME is hilarious, heartbreaking & always told through a sympathetic lense. Noah moves from comedy to tragedy seamlessly. He understands the human condition better than most writers, no, most people. BORN A CRIME is one one of the best books I've read this year & maybe the best memoir I've ever read. BORN A CRIME is a book of fascinating tales from Noah's youth. He was born and raised in South Africa. Being born half white and half black, the birth of an ""illegal"" union, he is ""born a crime"". Noah's stories sketch his life, with his mother, in South Africa. BORN A CRIME deals with the horrors of both pre & post-apartheid South Africa. Noah's style is very matter-of-fact. He never downplays, nor does he embellish the tragedy of what South Africa was. Noah knew no other way of life & sees racism in all its many facets as a routine way of life. However, the book isn't just filled with tales of darkness & suffering. Noah brilliantly balances this tragedy with mayhem, mischief & love throughout his stories. BORN A CRIME is as much a loving memoir to Noah's mother, Patricia as it is his own story. Noah's love and respect for his mother & the way she raised him shines through on nearly every page. She knowingly broke apartheid laws designating it to be a crime for sexual intercourse between people of different races. Yet, she didn't care. With a man she loved, a Swiss man, she persuaded him to be the father to the child she so desperately wanted. Resulting from this crime was Trevor Noah ~~neither black nor white ~~ yet born into a world that hated him for the color of his skin. Noah credits his mother With shaping him into the man he is today. It’s her discipline and loving heart that pushed Noah to succeed. BORN A CRIME begins and ends with Patricia's story. This is as much her story as it is Noah's. Noah’s stories of his childhood & adolescence in this ever changing world cleverly avoid sermonizing. Instead, Noah describes a resilient and opportunistic boy whose intuitive street smarts lead him into a hustler’s life. The ways in which Noah learns to navigate the changing world around him is worth the read itself.Along the way we learn of Noah's pooping in the kitchen and having to drive a demon out of the family home from that resulting poop, an abusive step-father, his early heart breaks with his first crushes, and his life as a music pirate ~~ it never occurred to Noah he was doing anything wrong, ""if copying CDs is wrong, why would they make CD writers?” We learn of his run ins with the cops, and the tragedy that befell his mother. I definitely hope to read more of his work in the future. I loved seeing this world Trevor Noah's eyes.!121!This is great! I wasn’t sure that I wanted to read it. A celebrity memoir by a mixed-race guy who was born in South Africa under apartheid didn’t sound like it would be a smart, funny, and charming pleasure to read, but it is. Not that he minimizes the circumstances, but there more fact than lamentation. It’s a shame about those people who don’t enjoy audiobooks. His performance adds to fantastic storytelling.The stories from his childhood reminded me of something Art Linkletter said about the children chosen for the “Kids Say the Darndest Things"" segment of his show. “It asked the dear teachers to give us the four children they would most like to have out of the class for a few blessed hours. The teachers would laugh and send me the rascals.” Not that that little Trevor was a bad kid, he is just one of those people that belong on a stage. He was a bit conflicted when exhorted to pray for God to kill the demon who had done the bad thing.
”Dear Lord, please protect us, um, you know, from whoever did this, like, we don’t know what happened exactly and maybe it was a big misunderstanding and, you know, maybe we shouldn’t be quick to judge when we don’t know the whole story and, I mean, of course you know best, Heavenly Father, but maybe this time it wasn’t actually a demon, because who can say for certain, so maybe cut whoever it was a break…”
I love his mother. Patricia Nombuyiselo NoahWhile this is Trevor's story, but it very much a loving tribute to her.!121!Five HUGE Stars for Trevor Noah's book! Believe the hype! I absolutely loved it. I listened to the audio. Trevor narrates his stories of growing up in South Africa. I highly recommend the audio version. He made this book come to life with his narration. This would actually make a good first listen.I just became a fan recently of his and thought I'd give the book a shot. I'm so happy I did! I learned a lot about apartheid and I learned a lot about South Africa. I also learned some gross facts like the poorest of people eat worms. At one point he and his family were so poor that they were eating them. Yuck! Trevor had me laughing. Trevor had me crying. Highly recommended to fans of his and/or people who just want to learn about life in South Africa during apartheid. Great book!!121!4.5 stars! This book made me love Trevor Noah even more than I already did. I was both enthralled and at times horrified, reading about Noah's experiences growing up during the tail end of apartheid in South Africa. Born on A Crime  is filled with heart, humor, trauma, and tears. This was a moving read that had me laughing and crying. My only regret was not choosing the audio version, as I would have loved to hear Noah narrate his experiences. I highly recommend!!121!Overall, Born a Crime is a fascinating story, but the loose editing and too casual a writing style meant it lacked narrative cohesion for me, so it's a solid 3 star review. Trevor Noah's childhood memoir definitely showcases his fresh, witty perspective and provide a lot of history and context of life under apartheid and life just after the end of apartheid, from a macro level of the forces and powers at work and warring against each other, to the micro level of Trevor and his family's experiences in that time. I've visited South Africa before and felt I knew a decent amount about the country's culture and history, but Noah really brought to light intricacies of daily life and nuances about how different groups interacted and experienced each other under and after apartheid. Noah's family is mostly seen in brief anecdotes and sketches, but his mother is a central figure and the most compelling character we encounter. Her faith, her hustle, her perseverance, and her sense of humor are palpable in Noah's writing, and we are shown the complex but very loving relationship between Trevor and his mother expand and grow over the years. Because the anecdotes and stories are presented in a non linear fashion, it can be difficult to get a fix on sense of time and when things are happening for Trevor and his mother and brothers. It also chops up the narrative flow, which meant that I was less interested in Trevor's own story since it kept hopping around in the timeline, and more interested in his family story and the larger context about how his race/color was being constantly perceived and redefined by different groups, and also by himself. As a multiracial American, I could relate to many aspects of Trevor's own shifting identity for himself and his peers, but many other aspects were completely foreign and indeed eye opening for me.The casual way Trevor narrates is both a highlight and a fault: it definitely jumps off the page is being securely in his voice, so it has a true feeling of authenticity. But it also has an effect of little editing and a lack of polish, so where other memoirists link events within a larger narrative framework and immerse you in the story AND the writing, here it's more disjointed, less cohesive, so you appreciate some of the parts more than the sum of their parts. And not all of the individual anecdotes feel fully worthy of inclusion. And the ending feels less like a natural ending and more like Noah ran out of steam (though the final story of the attempted murder of his mother is powerful and scary and was probably hard to write).Ultimately if you're a fan of Trevor Noah, or are interested in a unique perspective that unites childhood under and after apartheid with larger historical and social context of South Africa, Born a Crime is a solid choice. It's an easy read, but it took me longer than usual to finish since I was not really engaged with the non linear narrative and the style and format of the writing itself, though the subject matter was interesting.!121!Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood, Trevor NoahBorn a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood is an autobiographical comedy book written by the South African comedian Trevor Noah, first published in 2016.

this is one of the most touching love letters to a mother i have ever read. although this is presented as a collection of coming-of-age stories in a time where his existence was literally a crime, trevors words radiate pure and unconditional love for his mom. i am beyond humbled by the lessons trevors childhood taught him, his struggles, the way he see the world, how he treats others (especially women), and how his mom was there every step of the way. so heres to all the mothers who broaden our imaginations and give our dreams the space to soar. PS. i wholeheartedly regret not listening to this as an audiobook. i cant even imagine what an amazing experience it would be to hear trevor noah tells these stories personally. worthy of 100 stars, probably. ↠ 5 stars!121!Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah is a 2016 Spiegel & Grau publication. I’ve been a fan of Trevor Noah since he started hosting ‘The Daily Show’, but after reading this book, I’m an even bigger fan. I admit I know virtually nothing about South Africa other than the absolute obvious, like what is reported in the news. So, Trevor gives readers like myself a bit of a history and a maybe a civics lesson too, in how people are divided by class and race and the thought process or mindset of those who live in this country. Noah is of mixed race, born right before the end of apartheid, which made his birth illegal because whites and blacks were not allowed to have intercourse, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Despite his unique heritage, and his early isolation, Trevor’s mother provided him with an unconventional upbringing, one that obviously shaped him into the man and the success he would become as an adult. So, while this book is a memoir centered around Trevor’s childhood memories, and is an enlightening peek into the culture of South Africa, what I took away from this book was how much his mother loved him, how her parenting influenced him, made him strong, taught him respect, and protected him from serious missteps. I think, in his way, this book is not only a collection of Trevor’s vivid childhood memories and experiences, it’s an ode to his mother. These stories are often hysterically funny, but of course there are few difficult passages, too. But, overall, I enjoyed this book all the way from start to finish. Trevor’s voice is fresh and real, and his stories seem to come from his heart, showing a deep affection for his mom, detailing his adventures, both good and bad, with wry wit and humor that captured my heart and imagination. Trevor Noah is a wonderful comedic talent, but he’s proven he can write with equal success. I hope he continues to drop by the book world from time to time and of course wish him much luck with his hosting duties on ‘The Daily Show’.4.5 stars!121!I want this book right now right here!121!Born a Crime Stories from a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah is such an interesting look into the life of a talented young man. I am a big fan of Trevor and watched his special on Netflix where he speaks of his life growing up but this goes into so much detail, it is stunning all that this guy goes through and is not a bitter man. He describes the horrible laws and society he is born into and the way he is looked at in his society. How he tries to see himself. His life in poverty, with a very religious mother, an abusive step father, his struggles to find himself and diligent acts, his family, the horrible times in his life and the good times in his life. Through it all, he keeps his humor and love alive and shares it with us in this wonderful book. There is so much in here and he tells it so well. He has a good heart and it comes out in this book. He is not jaded by his past but seems to be inspired to be better because of it. Great job Trevor, we love you! Thanks NetGalley for allowing me to read this wonderful, touching book!!121!An amazing story of a young man and his mother who went around the block a few times and beat the odds. Despite a few inaccuracies in his tale, it remains a well-told story that kept me reading and reading until the very end. Trevor Noah has that intelligent kindness like an astral light around him. He has that look of wisdom and experience in his eyes which allow people to like and want to listen to him. He is a gentle soul. I guess he can thank his mom for that. She was on his case, saving his soul since the day he was born. Trevor Noah starts out his book with his usual irony. He establishes a high-speed tone that promises a suspense thriller on the spot. He was thrown out of a car and it was not a Hollywood movie at all ! From there he introduces his mother and grandmother which sets the tone of this book.My whole family is religious, but where my mother was Team Jesus all the way, my grandmother balanced her Christian faith with the traditional Xhosa beliefs she’d grown up with, communicating with the spirits of our ancestors. For a long time I didn’t understand why so many black people had abandoned their indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you’re Native American and you pray to the wolves, you’re a savage. If you’re African and you pray to your ancestors, you’re a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that’s just common sense....My mom didn’t want my mind polluted by movies with sex and violence. So the Bible was my action movie. Samson was my superhero. He was my He-Man. A guy beating a thousand people to death with the jawbone of a donkey? That’s pretty badass.He shares his personal story with so much wit and candor. Some incidences were so funny I just sat back and laughed and laughed. But then there were the moments of pain and sadness, so intense, that I felt like standing in his aura and hearing his thoughts before he expressed them. Tragic, yet destined to turn out to be miracles in the end. He shares many aspects of South African history and culture as background to his story, which enhances the experience for the reader. His sense of humor is always ready to jump in at the most unexpected moments. It was really a great read!As background to Trevor Noah's story, I want to provide a few tidbits of information.""Apartheid"" was an American concept that was applied to the South African landscape. Not many people realize that. When the Americans thought it a good idea to provide reservations for the indigenous people, the South African government thought is was a brilliant idea as well and follow it up with their own interpretation. When Americans thought there should not be social interaction between races in public premises, the South Africans followed suit.Black-only bus stops serviced Black-only buses. Black-only ambulances stopped at Black-only hospitals. Black-only education was provided at Black-only schools and universities. Beaches, bridges, swimming pools, washrooms, cinemas, benches, parks and even burial grounds were all segregated. Interracial marriages were strictly forbidden.Black people had their own magazines, newspapers, authors, journalists, movies, artists, musicians, music concerts, businesses and communities. Many wealthy Black people lived in the separated areas (there were even a wealthy black suburb called Beverly Hills in SOWETO) and made a good living. Black lawyers, doctors, teachers, and religious leaders served their own community. For instance, Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe both studied at the University of Fort Hare and finished their further studies at other universities, such as the universities of the Witwatersrand(WITS) and South Africa(UNISA). Their training were subsidized by the Apartheid government. They enjoyed free education as a result, while the White community had to pay for everything. Trevor Noah himself could have gone to university on the same principles with even more bursaries available to him than there were for white people. It is still the case.Biggest issue: Black people were denied the vote.His 'Hitler' story also lacked insight into the Afrikaner history (and neither did he knew about the HOLOCAUST and the Jewish experience). Trevor and his young adult friends were simply ignorant young men doing their own thing. Of course he did not have to know it, since it was never part of his own life. He described the Afrikaners's ""love"" for Hitler, but did not know how it worked. The Afrikaners lost their families in the Anglo-Boer war in which Britain followed a scorched-earth policy, leaving the Afrikaner farmers bankrupt and their families destroyed, dead in the concentration camps. The impoverished farmers abandoned their farms, which were immediately grabbed by the British government and handed over to British soldiers as payment for their services against the Afrikaners during the war. When the world declared war against Hitler, a small group of embittered Afrikaners organized themselves into a rebellion to assist Hitler against Britain. They simply hated the English. They would join any country declaring war against England. However, the vast majority of Afrikaners joined Britain in combat against Hitler. My father was one of them. We are from German descend. The South African soldiers, the majority being from the Afrikaner community who joined Great Britain were all descendants of the French, Dutch and German. They were joining the English forces who were shipped from the British colonies at the time. I just wanted to clear that up. Trevor and his mom were not part of the elite. They lived in the moderate, poor areas where workers and entrepreneurs felt at home. I was so happy that he mentioned the cultural cuisine. The 'smileys' he mentioned, sheep's head, are still highly popular. There are even sheep head clubs in the country.His revolt for sheep's eyes, which is also something to fight and die for by the dedicated eaters, had me almost falling off my bed with laughter. I cannot stand it either, although my husband and his farmer friends would make sure they can all enjoy it by buying themselves enough sheep heads for their club meetings and ensure nobody misses out on the eyes! Yes, be strong, dear friends. We could all have been like that, so don't laugh! ;-)   ""Walkie-talkies"", which he did not mention, are the heads and feet of chickens, which are also popular delicacies in the Asian communities. Trevor Noah's mom, however, knew it was the only dish that would get him to stay home for dinner instead of going out and enjoy his beloved Macdonalds.And then there is the 'Marogo' which he enjoyed, which I grew up with. It is a healthy weed, cooked like green beans with potato and unions, and normally enjoyed as a side dish, heaped onto 'mieliepap' (maize porridge). You're simply not South African if you have not eaten Marog and pap! It taste like spinach with a creamy effect.He took me back to my own childhood days, in a different time and place of course, but the nostalgia of that time came rushing over me while reading this book. We had so many happy moments, despite circumstances, and like Trevor, we as children never knew about Apartheid. Adults did not talk about it. It was quite a revelation when we finally grasped the meaning. We were the generation who brought it to en end. His story is so inspirational. A feel-good experience. I can only congratulate him and wish him all the best in the world He deserves it. And, most importantly, he will make it.You gooooo Trevor!!!! Thank you for the wonderful memories you shared. You made this world a much better place to be in, just by being you and sharing your heartfelt, often funny story.!121!I’m joining the club of other Rioters who have read and loved this one. Something you should know about me: memoirs are NOT my jam. I can count on one hand the memoirs I’ve read and enjoyed, so I was honestly shocked by how much I loved reading Born a Crime. Noah can tell a story like nobody’s business, and very often his tales weave tragedy and comedy together in the best way imaginable. I also have to admire Noah’s bare-bones honesty; he really doesn’t front at all. If you’re the type of person who wants a book that can make you laugh and cry in public, this is the one you’ve been looking for.— Tasha Brandstatterfrom The Best Books We Read In February 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/28/riot-r... ____________________Never have I experienced such alternatively intense emotions as I have listening to this book, where Noah recounts stories of his childhood in truly terrible conditions with humor and matter-of-factness. I had moments where I felt crushed by the realities of Apartheid, wondering how humans can be so cruel, followed by long stretches of laughter where I must have looked batty while driving, such was my delight in a chapter about sneaky pooping (and the aftermath). I’m talking crying laughing, gasping for air, and then eased back into some more sobering tales of close calls, losing friends, running from those who threatened him or his family. It’s only January, but this book is absolutely in my personal top 5 for the year. If nothing else, Born a Crime speaks in universals about human experiences, even simple things like learning to speak someone else’s native language and reaping the social benefits. It’s just set in a world that’s very far from my own.–Kristina Pinofrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r... ____________________He might be the baby-faced host of The Daily Show, but he was also raised a mixed-race child during Apartheid. Listening to him narrate the story of his childhood and all of the dangers that came with his very existence showed me that he’s a lot more than Jon Stewart’s slightly-less-beloved replacement. I may be frustrated recently with his call for other people of color to be moderate in their reactions to the incoming administration, but getting a bit of insight into the pain and tragedy he suffered at the hands of similarly-minded people was informative for me and has changed the way I view him.— Elizabeth Allenfrom The Best Books We Read In December 2016: http://bookriot.com/2017/01/03/riot-r...!121!Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestI consider myself an unofficial expert on celebrity memoirs. I haven't read all of them (although I would like to - even the stupid ones, because I am incredibly nosy and devour celebrity gossip the way other people devour Dorritos or fake news), but I've read a fair amount, and they usually follow a typical narrative arc. In BORN A CRIME, Trevor Noah takes that arc, flattens it out, and beats you over the head with it.I love Trevor Noah. I love what he brings to The Daily Show. I think he's incredibly funny, intellectual, erudite, and charming. I also think he's cute, but that's neither here nor there. I actually first learned about him through his (in)famous video with ""she who shall not be named"" (no, not Voldemort's sister - but close). I was really impressed by how he went about the interview. That could have been really ugly - but it wasn't; it was a somewhat civil discourse between two opposing views, about why the political beliefs of a certain demographic can be incredibly problematic.When I found out that this Trevor Noah person, this cool political cucumber, had a memoir out, I immediately put myself on hold for it at the library. Unfortunately, so did about a billion other people. It took two freaking months for me to finally get my hands on BORN A CRIME. Normally, when I wait that long, I start to lose interest and by the time I get the book I sometimes forget why I even bothered to put it on hold in the first place. Not so, here.Trevor Noah's memoir is not like other memoirs because he doesn't talk about his ""famous"" life at all. BORN A CRIME is about Trevor Noah's childhood growing up in South Africa while it was still under apartheid. He talks about slavery, segregation, racism, poverty, domestic violence and abuse, and all manner of other troubling topics, but he does it in a way that, while not exactly unpleasant, never becomes so graphic or unpleasant that I had to put the book down and take a deep breath. At times, he even manages to make the terrible situation he's describing funny, which is truly a testament to his amazing sense of humor.There's a lot more I can say, but most of it would just be recaps from the memoir and more praise about Trevor himself. I really, really loved this book. It kind of reminds me of another memoir I read about a biracial man, THE COLOR OF WATER by James McBride, but I feel like BORN A CRIME is going to be a lot more accessible because a) he's a pop-cultural icon, b) Noah's book is broader in scope in terms of topics discussed, and c) he's a millennial so his language will resonate with a lot of people, especially the young bloggers, who are reading and reviewing this book.Read this book. It was totally worth waiting for two months for.5 stars!121!ETA: The more I think about this book after having finished it, the more annoyed I become. I have changed my rating to one star. I did not like this book. What tipped the balance for me is the ""Go Hitler"" chant. The author's explanation was not adequate and I found the whole episode inappropriately drawn. ******************I was perpetually annoyed while reading this book. Perhaps this is my own fault. I misunderstood what its central focus was to be. It is less a book about growing up in South Africa than about adolescence, a dysfunctional family and physical abuse. In addition, I did not like the writing style. The first section of the book does offer a bit on South African history but only in sweeping terms. Apartheid practices are viewed through personal events. We see how race and religion came to shape the author’s life. The book does not follow a strictly chronological order, and I found this at times confusing. The central portion of the book deals with the author’s adolescence. Here the writing mirrors adolescent emotions. It is filled with swear words and smart aleck expressions. We hear of his problems with acne, dating and not fitting in. Drinking, hip-hop dancing, a disastrous prom night, bootlegging of CDs and DJ parties may interest others, but not me!I came to understand the author and the strong bond he felt for his mother, but his mother’s behavior is not covered with adequate depth. While her strong religiosity is emphasized, these beliefs do not always fit well with her other life choices. This left me puzzled. The final events of the book take a very dramatic turn. Ending on this note a reader may feel drawn to express sympathy and compassion. Does the exciting conclusion and the horror and sympathy all readers come to feel influence one’s rating of the book? My rating is based solely on my evaluation of the book and does not reflect the compassion I came to feel for the family. The humor did not make me laugh, and I found the author’s philosophical generalizations sophomoric. There is an all too long section on defecation. I found this disgusting. It should have been removed or at least shortened! The conjoining philosophical commentary is ridiculous. It is stated that when we defecate we are all on equal terms. Wow, I am terribly impressed with such remarkable wisdom. I am being sarcastic! The author reads his own audiobook. The reading is clear and easy to follow. I think by listening to his words one better understand his emotions and what he wishes to convey. I thought the book would have much more about life in South Africa and less about physical abuse in a dysfunctional family. The dramatic ending may appeal to some. The central portion will most certainly appeal more to young than to mature readers.!121!4.5 stars Trevor Noah, a comedian and the current host of 'The Daily Show' is a very funny guy.....and I expected this memoir to be full of witty jokes. It's not. The book is about Trevor growing up in South Africa when apartheid was coming to an end. Apartheid and it's aftermath left the impoverished black population of South Africa with hard lives and few opportunities. Nevertheless, Trevor infuses his story with hope and humor.Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah (Trevor's mother)Adult Trevor Noah with his father Robert NoahTrevor was born in 1984, to a white Swiss father and a black mother from the Xhosa tribe. At that time, apartheid was still in effect and mixing of the races was forbidden by law. Thus, light-skinned Trevor was evidence of a crime. The child - who lived with his mother in a black neighborhood - had to stay hidden inside during his early childhood....lest he be grabbed by the authorities and taken to an orphanage. Trevor Noah with his mother Little Trevor NoahYoung Trevor rarely went outside because mixed race children could be taken away School age Trevor NoahNomalizo Frances Noah (Trevor's grandmother) in front of her house, where Trevor lived as a kid Trevor's grandmother inside her homeTrevor's grandmother is proud of her familyTrevor's grandmother was reluctant to discipline him because she might damage his light skin The dismantling of apartheid in the early 1990's eased the situation for blacks and people of mixed race (classified as 'colored'), and Trevor and his mother - named Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - embarked on a rather tumultuous life. Patricia acquired secretarial skills and got an office job, which meant the Noahs were a little bit better off than many black South African families. Patricia even had a junky old car which - being a devout Christian - she used to 'schlep' Trevor to three or four different churches every Sunday. South African churchWhen Patricia wasn't working or at church she loaded Trevor into the car and took him to places that cost no money, like parks, picnics, and sightseeing past white people's mansions. Trevor's mom had the attitude ""I'm going to give you everything I never had."" Patricia made it her mission to provide food for Trevor's body and books for his mind - and to afford this, spent almost no money on anything else. As Trevor describes it: their car was a tin can on wheels; they lived in the middle of nowhere; they had shabby furniture; they changed the channels on their tiny black and white TV with pliers; and they wore clothes from thrift stores. During good times Trevor's family ate chicken, but when times were tough they ate food meant for dogs like 'sawdust' (meat scraps) and 'soup bones.' During one terrible month - when the mechanic business of Trevor's stepfather was failing - the family had to live on marogo (wild spinach) cooked with mopane worms (caterpillars). Trevor describes this as the worst time of his life.MarogoMopane wormsTrevor was a self-described 'naughty child' whose high energy level and mischievous pranks got him into lots of trouble. Trevor also loved fire and once burned down the house of a white family. To escape spankings from his mother, Trevor would streak out of the house and through the neighborhood - with Patricia close behind. As a result Trevor became a very fast runner, a talent that would be useful later on - when he had to run away from cops and tough guys. Though Patricia didn't spare the spankings, she punished Trevor 'out of love' - and he reciprocated the affection. Trevor was an enterprising youth and found inventive ways to make money. By the time he was in high school Trevor was selling pirated CDs he made at home - an enterprise that led to deejaying parties in black townships. Trevor also partnered up with a couple of friends to run a kind of 'loan and barter' business, which netted plenty of extra cash for McDonald's, beer, and electronic equipment. Trevor Noah looking coolOn the downside, Trevor never fit in anywhere. Being a light-skinned black, Trevor wasn't accepted by blacks, whites, Indians, Asians, or colored people (most of whom have a complicated ancestry beginning with Dutch settlers and black women). To compensate Trevor made it his business to learn many of the languages spoken in South Africa, including English, Afrikaans, Sotho, Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, and more. This made Trevor a sort of 'chameleon' who could get by with everyone.Trevor also had bad luck with girls, partly because he had terrible acne. Trevor describes several attempts to get a girlfriend, and these tales are amusing....and a little heartbreaking. In high school, for example, Trevor's friend set him up with a beautiful girl named Babiki for the matric dance (prom). Trevor and his friend hung out with Babiki and her sisters for a couple of months before the dance, getting acquainted. Then, on the night of the matric dance, Babiki refused to get out of the car and go inside. Trevor realized - for the very first time - that Babiki couldn't speak English and he couldn't speak Pedi (her language). Ha ha ha.Trevor Noah attended school at HC Jack in Highlands North, JohannesburgGirls dressed up for the matric danceThe worst thing that happened in Trevor's life was his mother's marriage to Abel, a car mechanic with a murderous temper and a strong 'master of the house' attitude. Patricia sold her house, quit her job, and impoverished the family to help Abel with his mechanic business....to no avail. Abel was a terrible businessman who drank up the profits and came home intoxicated and abusive. In fits of anger Abel would hit Patricia and slap Trevor around. By the time Trevor finished high school he had to move out. Patricia ultimately left Abel, who eventually became so distraught that he shot her in the head. In addition to his personal story Trevor talks about the evils of apartheid.....how the system purposely fomented discord among black tribes (especially Zulu and Xhosa), impoverished the non-white population, denied non-whites a decent education, left them untrained for jobs, made them feel inferior, took their homes and land, forced them into barren homelands, etc. etc. etc. Trevor touches on how this affected himself, his extended family, and his friends.....and the story is sad, bleak and dismaying. Zulu tribe celebrationXhosa tribe celebration (Trevor's mother belonged to the Xhosa tribe)Trevor's mother survived being shot in the head.....and the book ends there. Trevor doesn't talk about becoming a comedian, his show business career, or becoming host of The Daily Show. The program's original host, Jon Stewart, was terrific and I was sad when he left. Still, Trevor is doing a good job (in my opinion). He's personable, smart and funny.....and his impressions and accents are spot on. Trevor makes me laugh every time I watch the show. If Trevor writes a sequel to this book, I'll read it for sure. :)Trevor Noah sharing his book with a friend!121!Born a Crime

Funny guy- The very charming Trevor Noah*********************************************
""People love to say, “Give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he’ll eat for a lifetime.” What they don’t say is, “And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod.” That’s the part of the analogy that’s missing.""
Trevor Noah*********************************************By the time Trevor Noah was born in 1984, Apartheid, the system that institutionalized segregation and racial discrimination in his native South Africa, was already in its last throes. But young Trevor still got to experience plenty of the negative effects of that horrific system.The relationship between his black African mother and his white Swiss father, was legally prohibited by the 1927 ""Immorality Act"", a crime that could carry up to 5 years in prison. These laws were not a mere abstraction, they were actively enforced by the authorities.Noah did a good job at giving us a condensed version of the history of Apartheid. He explains how it was used to create fissures among the black population, and give us an insider's perspective of the real life consequences it had in the lives of millions of people.My sense is that this book was written with a Western audience in mind, so he takes the time to compare Apartheid to similar repressive movements in other parts of the world, such as the removal of Native Americans, European Colonialism and Slavery and the Jim Crow era in America.On this topic he remarks:
""In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.""


Baby Trevor growing up in South AfricaThe issue of race is a complicated one and Noah acknowledges how being biracial was a source of distress and confusion, while at the same time protected him and enhanced his social status.Personally I can relate to this. Colorism was something I encountered in the society where I grew up. Having a lighter skin didn't guarantee success, but it certainly helped remove a potential obstacle and it opened doors that otherwise could have remained closed.And yet, young Trevor frequently felt like an outsider, tolerated but not fully accepted. This started to change once he moved from her family home and started looking for ways to make a living.From his mother, he inherited an entrepreneurial spirit and started making some money by utilizing his many skills; he was multi-lingual, good with technology and had a knack for mixing music that his peers loved.If necessity is the mother of invention, Trevor and his fellow hustlers were the embodiment of that maxim. Eventually things turned bad when he became involved in petty crimes and got in trouble with the law.I think the most important chapter of this book is the one where Noah describes the social dynamics of the ""hood"" and how difficult it is for a kid without a support system to break the cycle of poverty and violence.
""We tell people to follow their dreams"" he says,""but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited.""
Trevor's mother is the one constant and positive presence in his life, a deeply religious, strong woman who taught him to ""challenge authority and question the system"". By the end of the memoir he realizes that she more than anyone, is the person he can count on. She is his saving grace. There are plenty of funny moments and hilarious anecdotes on Born a Crime, so it would be tempting to categorize this as just a rag-to-riches, pull up by your bootstraps kind of story. In reality though, Noah has written a profound account about his humble beginnings, the pervasive presence of violence in his home and his country at large, and his own racial identity crisis, the result of having been born in a place where the frequent reaction to a person of mixed race was astonishment, contempt or both.The fact that Noah was able to overcome such a difficult upbringing it almost miraculous and reason enough to read his story. But I think his views on poverty, racism, domestic violence are also worth listening to, mainly because he has the emotional scars to prove his credentials as a reliable witness.This is a very moving memoir that will make you laugh and cry, but I trust that it will also leave you with a good dose of optimism.!121!4 starsBorn a Crime is a memoir about Trevor Noah’s childhood in South Africa. I honestly don’t know much about Trevor Noah and I’ve never watched any of his stuff, but I got this as a freebie on audible forever ago and thought now would be a good time to read it. I’m so glad I did. The best part about this audiobook is that Trevor Noah narrated it. With the different languages spoken and dialects, it was great to hear it all in Noah’s voice. Also, as heavy as it was at times, his humor really shined through. It’s so interesting to me to see how different things are in other countries. I am close to the same age as Trevor Noah and I can’t imagine growing up the way he did. Reading others stories that aren’t like yours is so important. This story is important, it’s powerful, and if you’re going to read it, I can’t recommend the audiobook enough. The narration is spectacular. 

“People love to say, “Give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he’ll eat for a lifetime.” What they don’t say is, “And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod.” That’s the part of the analogy that’s missing.”!121!Once again, I decided to read something from the non-fiction/biography genres. Partly because I adore Trevor Noah as a person. Partly because I love Trevor Noah's voice & appreciate when authors tell their own stories, both fictional and non-fictional. & Partly because I want to try and get more comfortable with reads like this that are outside of my normal realm. In this Trevor tells many stories from his childhood in South Africa. He is funny, well-spoken, and insightful as he discusses how being the product of a white Swiss father and a black South African mother both worked for and against him, depending on the situation. This was an excellent book, though I wish he hadn't jumped around on his timeline as much as he did. It wasn't really a big deal but I sort of had trouble keeping up with the chronological order of the events he was describing. I would very much recommend this for everyone, even if you don't particularly like Trevor Noah! My friend Michael talks about how much he enjoyed the book in his review, despite not being the author's biggest fan.!121!I was lucky to see Trevor Noah speak about this book recently, and the way he talked about his story, and his life growing up in South Africa made me all the more eager to read it! The book is a cohesive collection of stories from his childhood and early adulthood, and though I am not typically a reader of much non-fiction, I found this book truly compelling and hard to put down!Noah has a way of really drawing you in, and making you feel as though you are there with him, experiencing his memories and seeing South Africa during and after apartheid as he did. He doesn't glorify himself and doesn't shy from describing certain flaws in himself, his family and the world he grew up in, which makes it seem very real and believable, and makes me wish I knew even more.I have never visited South Africa, but I felt like a true armchair traveler reading ""Born a Crime"", and learning about the way of life of ""ordinary"" people, instead of monumental historical figures like Nelson Mandela. I liked how Noah gave character to individual neighborhood I had never heard of, but can now visualize with a sense of greater understanding. His descriptions of the people in this book make them come to life, especially his mother, who raised Noah under difficult circumstances and to whom the book is dedicated. She is such a central character, if you will, of this book, and Noah doesn't sugarcoat her actions or mentality, which sometimes made it difficult for me to fully understand the devotion he felt toward her, when she so often put him down, beat him, and forced him to accept that her second husband and father of Noah's two younger brothers was a violent, deeply unpleasant man, whom she did not leave until it was almost too late. This was difficult to read, at times, but definitely served to paint a truly vivid image of her and of their, sometimes fraught, but ultimately loving relationship.The explanation of segregation and divides between race were another element that fascinated me about this story, especially in light of the racial tensions that have arisen in society and culture recently, made more visible through social media and the fast pace of news (though they have obviously been there a long time). I knew, of course, of the way apartheid worked, and the extreme division and misery it created, but I did not know of the many different classifications that existed within African communities themselves, that ""colored"" people, as Noah describes those of mixed race, were not included in black communities or white communities, and that he, being the son of a white man and a black woman, never felt he fit in properly. It is interesting to read about this, and though the book is set in Africa, I think it is, in a way, quite timely, and well worth reading, if only to see that change for the better can happen. Segregation and racism exist everywhere, and therefore people must collectively work against it to create societies that value tolerance and diversity.This was a well-written, thought-provoking book and I would recommend it to fans Trevor Noah, or even those who have never heard of him, but what to be entertained, and learn something in the bargain.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Autobiography', 'Africa']"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow (Hardcover)",Daniel Kahneman,4.18,493501,2011,"In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking.","This is a fascinating book. Reading this book means not having to read so many others. For example, you could avoid having to read, Sway, Blink, Nudge and probably a dozen or so other books on Behavioural Economics. And the best part of it is that this is the guy (or, at least one half of the two guys) who came up with these ideas in the first place. I was thinking that perhaps the best way to explain those other books would be to compare them to Monty Python. I want you to imagine something - say you had spent your entire life and never actually seen an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. That wouldn't mean you wouldn't know anything about Monty Python. It is impossible to have lived at any time since the late 60s and not have had some socially dysfunctional male reprise the entire Parrot sketch or Spanish Inquisition sketch at you at some stage in your life. I suspect, although there is no way to prove this now, obviously, that Osama bin Laden could do the Silly Walk like a natural. Well, if you had never seen an episode of Monty Python and your entire experience of their work was via the interpretation of men of a certain age down the pub - then finally getting to see an episode of the original would be much the same effect as reading this book. Hundreds of people have already told all this guy's best stories in their own books - but all the same it is a pleasure to hear them again by the guy that first said, 'this parrot is dead' or rather, 'framing effects make fools of us all'.You need to read this book - but what is particularly good about it is that you come away from it knowing we really are remarkably easy to fool. It's because we think we know stuff that this comes as a constant surprise to us. Years ago I was talking to a guy who liked to bet. Everyone needs a hobby and that was his. Anyway, he told me he was playing two-up - an Australian betting game - and he realised something like tails hadn't come up frequently enough and so he started betting on tails and sure enough he made money. I told him that coins don't remember the last throw and so the odds of getting a tail was still 50%, as it had previously been. But I had no credibility - I'd already told him I never bet - so, how would I possibly know anything if I wasn't even brave enough to put my own money on the outcome? And didn't I understand the point of this story was he had already WON?Still, when faced with a series of coin flips that run - H, H, H, H, H, T, H, H, H - it does feel like tails are 'due'. This is the sort of mistake we are all too prone to make. The thing to remember is that while there is a law of large numbers - toss a coin often enough and in the very long run there will be as many heads turn up as tails - that isn't the case in the short run - where just about anything is possible.We (that is, we humans) are remarkably bad at mental statistics. And what makes it worse is that we are predictably bad at statistics. And this brings me to Bourdieu and him saying that Sociology is kind of martial art. He means that Sociology allows you to defend yourself from those who would manipulate you. Well, this book is the Bruce Lee book of advanced self-defence. Learning just how we fool ourselves might not make you feel terribly great about what it means to be human - but at least you will know why you hav stuffed up next time you do stuff up. I'm not sure it will stop you stuffing up - but that would be asking for an awful lot from one book.If you want the short version of this book, he has provided the two papers that probably got him the Nobel Prize - and they are remarkably clear, easy to understand and comprehensive. But look, read this book - it will do you good.!121!In the last few years two books took me FOREVER to get through. The first was Daniel Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and the second is Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" What caused this? What do they have in common? Both books explain, in minute detail, simple concepts with immensely far-reaching implications, and both have been... after the slog... the most intellectually rewarding reading of my adult life. Where to begin... I have a number of theories running around in my head, and occasionally I try to corral them on paper. I organize, sequence and interconnect them in a way that will prevent my reader from meaningfully widening their eyes, in an aside, while winding their finger around one ear... (""Cuckoo!"") Good writing about complex topics is very, very difficult, and Kahneman has corraled 30+ years of science, his career and all he has learned into a perfectly arranged sequence that leads the reader into a wilderness... provisioning you in each chapter with the tools you'll need for the next part of the journey.The second most striking effect on me is the number of times I said, ""Yes... YES!!! this is what I've been saying!"" In my case it has usually been some sort of ""intuitive""(excuse me, Mr. Kahneman... I mean ""System 1"") recognition of a pattern in my observations about the way we think. In Kahneman's case those intuitions have been converted into theoretical propositions, each meticulously researched in well designed experiments. Clearly, this is at least one difference between me and a Nobel Prize winning researcher.So why does this stuff matter? In the context of broader discussions of free will, intention, choice and control over the directions our lives take, this book can provide powerful insights that might currently be obscured by these ""cognitive illusions"" and the inherent limitations of ""System 1/System 2"" thinking. Perhaps we're not as ""free"" in our decisions as we might like to think, if ""priming"" has such a stunningly reproducible effect. Perhaps we're not so determined, if activities that initially require ""System 2"" attention, can be turned into second-nature, ""technical-expertise intuitions."" I.e. learning and training MATTERS in our ability to detect and respond to events that... if untrained... might take advantage of our brain's inherent ""blind spots"" or weaknesses. Perhaps childhood religious indoctrination is a very adept recognition of these mental tendencies/flaws, so profoundly (if intuitively/naively) expressed by Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, ""Give me the boy until 7, I will give you the man."" (paraphrased; forgive me) Kahneman's discoveries and documentation of mental capacity and biases could form the basis of a ""Mental Martial Arts"" program: an alternative form of indoctrination, in which students are trained to understand their brains' weaknesses, and learn to take stances or engage in practices that eliminate or reduce the errors to which these weaknesses can lead. This book will rearrange the way you think... about how you think.!121!An unrelentingly tedious book that can be summed up as follows. We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. Life not only is uncertain, we cannot understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. Above all, determine the baseline before you come to any decisions. If you like endless -- and I mean endless -- algebraic word problems and circuitous anecdotes about everything from the author's dead friend Amos to his stint with the Israeli Air Defense Force, if you like slow-paced, rambling explanations that rarely summarize a conclusion, if your idea of a hot date is to talk Bayesian theory with a clinical psychologist or an economist, then this book is for you, who are likely a highly specialized academically-inclined person. Perhaps you are even a blast at parties, I don't know. But if you're like me and you prefer authors to cut to the chase, make their point, and then leave you with a whopping big appendix if you're interested in the regression analysis of how many freshmen would watch a guy choke to death because they think someone else will come to the rescue, then this book is not for you.If you want to take the Reader's Digest pass through the book, then Chapter 1 and Section 3 are probably the most accessible and can be read in less than an hour, and still leave you with a fair understanding of the author's thesis.!121!I kind of want to cut this book in half, praise the first part, and stick the second part in some corner to gather dust. Not that the second part is bad, mind you; the entire book is well-written and obviously the product of someone who knows their field. There’s just a lot of it. Thinking, Fast and Slow is kind of like a guest who shows up to your party and then dazzles everyone with an impromptu, 15-minute oration on the geopolitical situation in South Ossetia; and, everyone applauds and turns to go back to their own conversations, only for the guest to launch into another story about the time they parachuted into the Balkans to break up a nascent civil war, a story which is followed quickly by a similar tale of a visit to Southeast Asia…. Well, I think you catch my drift. Daniel Kahneman spins an interesting tale of human psychology and the way our brains interpret and act on data. But the book overstays its welcome by a few hundred pages.Kahneman’s thesis breaks our decision-making systems into two pieces, System 1 and System 2, which are the respective “fast” and “slow” of the title. System 1 provides intuitive judgements based on stimulus we might not even be conscious of receiving; it’s the snap signals that we might not even know we are acting upon. System 2 is the more contemplative, cognitively taxing counterpart that we engage for serious mental exertion. Though often oppositional in the types of decisions they produce, Kahneman is keen to emphasize that it’s not about System 1 versus System 2. Instead, he’s out to educate us about how the interplay between these systems causes us to make decisions that aren’t always rational or sensible given the statistics and evidence at hand.Kahneman takes us through an exhaustive tour of biases and fallacies people are prone to making. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, confirmation bias, and even regression to the mean. As a mathematician, I liked his angle on probability and statistics; as a logician, I appreciated his brief segues into the logical aspects of our contradictory decision-making processes. Lest I give the impression Kahneman gets too technical, however, I should emphasize that, despite its length, Thinking, Fast and Slow remains aggressively accessible. There are a few points where, if you don’t have a basic grasp of probability (and if Kahneman demonstrates anything, it’s that most people don’t), then you might feel talked over (or maybe it’s those less-than-infrequent, casual mentions of “and later I won a Nobel Prize”). But this book isn’t so much about science as it is about people.There are two other things I really appreciated about this book, both of which are related to psychology. I’m a fairly easygoing person, and I don’t always like to make waves, but sometimes I like to make some trouble and argue with some of my friends about whether psychology is a science. The problem for psychology is that it’s actually a rather broad term for a series of overlapping fields of investigation into human behaviour. On one end of this continuum, you have Freud and Jung and the various psychoanalysts who, let’s face it, are one step up from astrologers and palm-readers. On the other end, you have the cutting-edge cognitive psychology informed by the neuroscience of MRIs, split-brain studies, and rat research. So claiming that psychology is or isn’t a science is a little simplistic, and I’m willing to grant that there are areas within psychology that are science. For what it’s worth, Kahneman went a long way to reinforcing this: it’s clear he and his collaborators have done decades of extensive research. (Now, yes, it’s social science, but I won’t get into that particular snobbery today.)The other thing I liked about Thinking, Fast and Slow is its failure to mention evolutionary psychology. Once in a while, Kahneman alludes to System 1’s behaviour being the result of evolutionary adaptation—and that’s fine, because it is true, almost tautologically so. But he never quite delves into speculation about why such behaviour evolved, and I appreciate this. There’s a difference between identifying something as an adaptation and determining why it’s an adaptation, and I’m not a fan of evolutionary psychologists’ attempts to reduce everything to the trauma of trading trees for bipedalism … I’m willing to admit I have an ape brain, but culture must count for something, hmm?I suppose it’s also worth mentioning that this book reaffirms my supercilious disregard for economics. According to Kahneman, stock brokers and investors have no idea what they are doing—and some of them know this, but most of them don’t. Economists are, for the most part, highly-trained, but they seem bent upon sustaining this theoretical fantasy land in which humans are rational creatures. Aristotle aside, the data seem to say it isn’t so. I occasionally try my hand at reading books about the economy, just so I can say I did, but they usually end up going over my head. I’m a mathematician and I don’t get numbers—but at least I’m not the only one.So Thinking, Fast and Slow is genuinely interesting. I learned a lot from it. I would rate it higher, but I was starting to flag as I approached the finish line. Truth be told, I skipped the two articles Kahneman includes at the end that were the original publications about the theories he explains in the book. I’m sure they are fascinating for someone with more stamina, but at that point I just wanted to be done. That’s never good: one of the responsibilities of a non-fiction author is to know how to pace a book and keep its length appropriate. Too short and the book is unsatisfying—too long, and maybe it’s more so. And I think this flaw is entirely avoidable; it’s a result of Kahneman’s tendency to reiterate, to circle back around to the same discussions over and over again. He spends an entire chapter on prospect theory, then a few chapters later he’s telling us about its genesis all over again, just from a slightly different angle. Like that party guest, Kahneman is full of interesting stories, but after telling one after another for such a long period of time, it starts sounding like white noise. And he ate all those little cocktail snacks too.I inevitably ended up comparing Thinking, Fast and Slow to 
How We Decide
, a much slimmer volume along much the same lines as this one. Whereas Lehrer’s focus is on the neurology behind decision-making, Kahneman is more interested in the psychology. Both books boil down to: we suck at automatic decision-making when statistics are involved; therefore, we behave less rationally than we believe we do. Lehrer explains why things go wrong, and Kahneman categorizes all the different way things go wrong. In many ways the books are complementary, and if this is an area of interest for you, I’ll recommend them both. For the casual reader, however, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rather dense meal. By all means, give it a try, but take it slow.Also posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my reviews and subscribe to my digest newsletter.!121!As the blurb summarises very well, in “Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a ground-breaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour.”Kahneman has won the Nobel Prize for economy so expect a lot of technical stuff and experiments in this one. Exactly how I like my non-fiction to be. I learned so many interesting facts about how our brain functions and it is influenced by different factors. Some aspects mentioned in this volume: -	People do not understand statistics well. I am a fan of the subject and base many decisions on statistics. Apparently, most people don’t. I guess, I now understand why people ignore statistics about the pandemic. -	Luck plays a major role in success-	Our brain tends to be lazy, system 2 does not rush to help-	Intuition vs formulas- science usually win-	Investment bankers are useless-	We overestimate our ability to predict the future-	Stereotypes matter more than statistics-	We tend to be more risk prone when we have something to lose than when we have something to gain. -	What you see is all there is. We tend to form opinions based on only what we know and tend to ignore that there might be other relevant information we might miss.-	Priming can be used to influence people. For example pictures of eyes can make people feel watched-	And many moreThe last part was a bit too technical and a bit boring but I still think the book deserves 5*.!121!Daniel Kahneman is a Genius. But if you know his work, you know that already.A Nobel Prize winner, his work is weighty and a bit recondite into the bargain. But hasn't he ignored the CHRISTIAN worldview, the world of good and evil? For isn't this book SPIRITUALLY rather trite, being addressed only to those sharpies who only wanna learn how to PLAY THE GAME?Even if that ends in emotional bankruptcy?I think so. So here's my own, Christian take on it:We all live in a postmodernist, secular world now. When we come of age into that scenario, many of us learn a bit of caution. Unless this brutal coming of age makes us hip and glib.So there are two ways of thinking now. One is thinking fast (hip and glib) and the other is thinking slow (religiously cautious). Thinking fast, in this book, is Optimal.But here’s a point Kahneman neglects...The hip and glib guys get hurt by those postmodernistic sharp edges more easily than the cautious guys. So the hip side becomes cautious, and, of course as they age, the hard knocks confuse them. They end up more confused and conflicted than the cautious ones most of the time.Such is the Moral Levelling of Age.The cautious folks believe in true love, and often eternal verities, though. We’ll call them the sheep, cause they follow their hip friends as only sheep serve. The hip guys, the planners, believe in basically nothing - they’re all fast talk and action. We’ll call them the goats: they love to butt heads with you.As I say, this sheep/goat take on Thinking Fast is my own. Kahneman never goes there. Where he DOES go is to the value of experience in thinking fast:To think fast, he says, experience is key. Experience gives us heuristic benchmarks.The more experienced folks think faster. And because they’re so sure of the facts, we often ill-advisedly trust them.But now back to my own take: hip guys HAVE some of this experience, because they are hip. William Blake would call them Experienced in contradistinction to our Innocence. It’s an Experience that can’t discern. It has no wisdom.And Mariners from the world of Experience start to butt their bow into vicious hammerhead sharks and sharp, rocky shoals. Agressive Experience runs out of motivation early, unlike the restful boat of Innocence. Innocence isn’t conflictual. It BENDS rather than confronts.It lives longer and healthier. And learns discernment.Remember Aesop’s fable of the Tortoise and the Hare? The lowly rabbit wins the race.Just so, the meek inherit the Earth...And a state of peaceful contentment.Daniel Kahneman has his Nobel-winning theories -But I have my own happy and elderly Discernment -My Slow Thinking -And my Peace of Mind.Doesn't that count, too?!121!If your objective, like it is when one finishes reading a self-help book, is to implement what Mr. Kahneman has to say in real life and benefit from it, I should warn you, you will be sorely disappointed. Believe it or not, in my opinion, I believe Mr. Kahneman is telling you exactly that in this book - that whether you like it or not, your entire life is guided or may I say decided by two fundamental ideas and that there is very little you can do to change it, period. Mr. Kahneman is probably the villain in every modern day spiritual guru's life, he argues very effectively that contrary to what these gurus may say the external world/ your environment/ surroundings/ or even society for that matter has a large say in your personal deliberate actions. You don't have a choice. So, having said that, shelving this book in psychology section would be gross injustice. In my view this is such a good commentary of human nature. The two are different, very much so. Read it, totally worth it in my opinion. Can get a little too drab but hang in there, this book is an eye opener.!121!Hands down, one of the best books in its genre. The book is a lengthy, self-conscious and a challenging read but highly recommended if you're interested in why human beings behave the way they behave. It's given me so much 'oh snap, so that's why we're so dumb' moments that at this point I don't even want to admit I'm a human to any space-time traveling race that comes in collision of 21st century Earth.Citing behavioral research studies, he's convinced me that human confidence is a measure of whether a person has built up a coherent story not that the person truly knows what she's doing. He's convinced me that the feeling of 'ease' is just cognitive familiarity. He's convinced me why first impressions matter more than we think due to the Halo effect. He's convinced me that the human mind doesn't understand non-events. We think we understand the past, but we really don't. We create coherency by attributing causality to events, but not to non-events. In other words we underestimate the role of luck or the role of unknown variables in a given situation. He has given me reason to believe that in low validity environments, it's better to use formula's than to listen to expert human judgment. For example, the stability of a marriage can be better predicted by a simple equation like [stability = frequency of love making - frequency of arguing] than an expert opinion.But one of the most interesting hypothesis he builds up is the existence of two systems in the mind. System 1 is prone to cognitive biases described above, but it's also where morality comes from. Not to mention intuitive judgment and hueristic answers to life's everyday questions. Would you believe it? Morality is more of an intuitive thing than a logical and reasonable framework! And the funny thing is without system 1, we'd won't survive a day in the life. Not to mention we wouldn't act human. System 2 on the other hand is more introspective, rational and is capable of being aware of the cognitive biases created by System 1. If my understanding is correct then, we can replicate system 2 by a machine or artificial intelligence. But that machine will not have the same extent of morality that we have.... food for thought! In later chapters of the book, he describes another variation of duality in the human mind. An Experiencing Self and a Remembering Self. With countless examples (both experimental and anecdotal) he vividly paints a picture of how humans have this notion of ""I am my remembering self, and strangely my experiencing self is a stranger to me."" We're actually okay with letting our Experiencing Self suffer for the good of the Remembering Self!! This ties in to the cognitive bias of ""focusing Illusion"" (Focalism) and how we tend to overestimate a certain aspect of life. To put the icing on the cake he finalizes the book by analyzing how we appreciate, value and judge the quality of our lives with all these biases combined. And it's amazing how irrational we are in doing so. Not only have I realized from this book that I should stop worrying about societal standards (because they are mostly based on irrational biases) but that I should spend a significant amount of my time and effort to into creating a value structure ideally suited for myself. Now, only if I had bit more memory and cpu speed on System 2...!121!I read almost 30% of a book that is a few years old, but I did not finish it.I decided to read it again from the first page because it was recommended by many YouTubers, websites, and podcasts.I want to learn how to think better and make good decisions.I used my System 1 when I looked at the cover and title of this book. (It seemed easy and attractive) 😉When I started reading, I spent most of my time using my System 2 to think and understand. (It takes time and brain energy to read and understand) 😅""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" explains the complexities of human decision-making, unveiling two cognitive systems: intuitive System 1 and analytical System 2.Our minds have two systems: System 1, fast and automatic, guiding intuition and snap judgments, and System 2, slower and deliberate, crunching complex problems.These systems often clash, leading to biases and errors.The book explores these inner battles, revealing how our thinking works, why we make mistakes, and how to improve our decisions.!121!Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel KahnemanThinking, Fast and Slow was the 2012 winner of the National Academies Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in behavioral science, engineering and medicine. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Daniel Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «تفکر، سریع و کند»؛ «تفکر، سریع و آهسته»؛ نویسنده: دانیل کانمن؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نهم ماه اکتبر سال 2016میلادیعنوان: تفکر، سریع و کند؛ نویسنده: دانیل کانمن؛ مترجم فروغ تالوصمدی؛ کرج نشر دُرّ دانش بهمن، سال‏‫1394؛ در681ص؛‬‬ شابک9789641741770؛ چاپ دوم سال1395؛ چاپهای سوم و چهارم سال1396؛ چاپهای پنجم تا هشتم سال1397، در556ص؛ موضوع: اندیشه و تفکر - تصمیم‌گیری - از نویسندگان ایالات متحده امریکا - سده20معنوان: تفکر سریع و کند؛ نویسنده: دانیل کانمن؛ مترجم ساناز توتونچی؛ مشهد زرین‌کلک آفتاب‏‫، جلد دوم سال1395؛ در سه جلد، شابک9786008164425؛عنوان: تفکر، سریع و آهسته؛ نویسنده: دنیل کانمن؛ مترجم نغمه رضوی؛ ویراستار مهران اره‌چی؛ تهران هورمزد‏‫، سال‏‫1398؛ در604ص�� شابک9786006958637؛‬‬کتاب «تفکر، سریع و آهسته»؛ شامل سه بخش از مراحل کاری «کانمن» است، «کارهای اولیه»، یعنی «سویه گیریهای شناختی»، سپس «نظریه چشم انداز»، و پس از آن «پژوهشهایی در زمینه شادی» است؛ محور اصلی کتاب دوگانگی میان حالت اندیشه است: سیستم دو آهسته تر، خودخواسته تر و منطقی تر است، در حالیکه سیستم یک: سریع، غریزی، و احساسی است؛ این کتاب ترسیم سویه گیریهای شناختی در ارتباط با هر نوع اندیشه است، که با پژوهشهای خود «کانمن» درباره ی نفرت از باخت آغاز میشود؛ این کتاب، با پشتوانه ی چند دهه پژوهشهای دانشگاهی، نشان میدهد که افراد، با تغییر چارچوب پرسش، و جایگزین کردن پرسشهای ساده تر، در حقیقت به قضاوتهای انسانی، اهمیتی بیش از حد میدهند؛ «کانمن»، با شرح کارکرد دو سیستم، تلاش میکنند نشان دهند، که چهئ زمانی میتوانیم، در تصمیم گیریهای مربوط به زندگی و تجارت، به بینش و دریافتهای خود باور داشته باشیم، و در چه زمانی از آن باید بپرهیزیم، و با شیوه ی شناخت «سویه گریهای ذهنی» چگونه میتوانیم از اشتباهاتمان دوری کنیم؛ این کتاب برنده ی جایزه ی بهترین کتاب «آکادمی ملی علوم» و جایزه ی کتاب «لس آنجلس تایمز»، و برگزیده ی ناقدان کتاب «نیویورک تایمز»، به عنوان یکی از ده کتاب سال2011میلادی شناخته شده استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 27/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 12/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!It is very difficult to judge, review or analyze a book that basically challenges the very idea of human “Rationalism”. Are humans perfectly rational? This dude, Daniel Kahneman, got a Nobel Prize in Economics for saying they are not. An ordinary person might have been treated with glare or a stinging slap if he said that to someone’s face. We simply don’t like being told that we are not very rational and certainly not as intelligent as we think we are. Hidden in the depths of our consciousness, are some ‘actors’ that keep tempering with our ‘rationality’. And we almost consciously allow this to happen. 	All in all, this book is a tour de force of Behavioral Psychology. Explaining how our mind comes to conclusions and makes decisions, Kahneman explains that our intuition and decision making part of brain has two personalities. These personalities, he says, are not two different or distinct systems but to understand them better, we will have to assign personalities not only to understand them better but also to be able to relate to them on a personal level. 	The two systems are called system 1 and system 2, for the sake of convenience. System 1 is vigilant, impulsive, judgmental, easily manipulated, highly emotional. System 2, on the other hand is the total opposite of system 1, it is very intelligent, indolent, mostly drowsing off in the back of our head, difficult to convince and extremely stubborn, and it only comes to action when there is some sort of ‘emergency’. Both these systems are susceptible to a number of biases, system 1 more than system 2.	I thought Kahneman would build up this narrative systematically but he goes on to give us a tour of his years of research, experiments and surveys exploring every nook of our conscious human mind. He focuses on a diverse set of heuristics and biases that influence our judgments in everyday life. With some brilliant experiments and survey reports, he convincingly elaborates the effects that these biases have on our decisions. Never forgetting to highlight the fallacies of our consciousness, he touches on a number of other important breakthroughs in the world of psychology. This is a very simple case of visual illusion where we see two lines of same size appearing to be of varying lengths. Even after knowing that they are equal and the illusion is created by the fins attached to them, our system 1 still impulsively signals that one of them is longer then the other. Through this simple illustration, he moves on to introduce Cognitive Illusions, which are more fascinating, and are drastically more effective.	Kahneman contends that it is extremely difficult to overcome heuristic biases. Although, through methods like using statistical formulas and deliberate scrutiny we can ‘rationalize’ our decisions to some extent. Still, we are inherently prone to fall for dazzling rhetoric and dashing figures, we believe in myths and incidents that are as improbable as they are ludicrous, because this is the way we see things. But this is not undesirable altogether, some of the intuitive abilities are an evolutionary blessing that help us understand emotions and make correct decision in split seconds. Neither does the author deems it expedient to overcome these biases, but only to recognize them and put our system 2 to work before making crucial judgments. 	 I am afraid that this review is getting a bit too long, and to be honest, I don’t think anyone reads long reviews.(Except some of my nerdy goodread friends who then leave an equally baffling Proustian comment, which of course, takes quite a while to be properly understood.) So I will mention a summary of some critical biases, ideas and psychological phenomenon that I found interesting. 	---------------------------------------------------------------I have attempted to summarize some heuristics, biases and psychological principle that I thought would make a fascinating introduction to tempt a novice like me to further explore the subject. They are just the tip of iceberg and not by any means exhaustive and just comprise a small part of what this book is all about. Associative machine: System 1 works in surprising ways, read this 			BANANA VOMIT Now, a lot happened in last few seconds when you read these two words. You wore an expression of disgust and a very bad image came to your mind, your body too reacted in disgust and for short time you might not want to eat bananas. All of this was automatic and beyond your control. It was “The Associative Machine” of system 1. We associate seemingly some unrelated images and with some imagination, form an image. Our brain loves patterns and some times it sees things that aren’t even there. A very interesting clip in which Simon Singh shows associative machine at work : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bG7E...Priming: Exposure to a word causes immediate changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen if you had just seen WASH.Similarly, exposure to an idea or event can also have similar temporary effect on our behavior. (“Florida Effect”)Cognitive Ease: We all love it when we don’t have to work too hard because system 2 doesn’t like being bothered. So we admire and rather look for cognitive ease. Things that are less complex have a positive effect on our behavior. Psychologists use the term “Mind at ease puts a smile on the face”. Similarly, smiling and laughing can also ease our mind (system 1) and make us feel confident and in control. Anything that is easy to understand (read or see) is likely to have a more positive effect on us as compared to anything that we have a hard time understanding or visualizing.Exposure Effect: We are more likely to choose the thing we are more familiar with. The principle that “Familiarity breeds liking” suggests that we are more inclined towards anything that is familiar and has been exposed to us before in past. The more the exposure is, the more we will be inclined towards it. This principle is excellently illustrated in Will Smith’s “Focus” (2015).a similar trick is used to con a billionaire. Normality illusion: Things that recur with greater frequency are considered normal, no matter how horrendous they are. Two people killed in a terrorist attack in a western country are more likely to be mourned then a hundreds of children killed in Gaza by a missile strike. Simply due to the fact that children in Gaze get bombed all the time, while a terrorist attack that kills innocents is sort of rarity in Europe and America. (The same concept is present in Orwell’s Animal Farm in which pigs start to dominate other animals and it becomes the norm after a while.)Substitution: If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it. For instance when asked How happy are you with your life these days? Its more likely that we don’t use a broad frame to answer the question and substitute it with a simpler question “What is my mood right now?”. System 1 can readily answer the substitute question but to answer the real question, System 2 would have to be excited, which as we know System 2 doesn’t like. In everyday life, we use this to avoid making decisions and expressions based on factual background and therefore make an impulsive and sometimes irrational comment to a difficult question.  What you see is there is: We take pride in our intuitive abilities which leads us to believe that we know the whole truth, no matter how fallible our sources are, and not withstanding the fact that there is always another side of the picture. When we hear a story or an incident, we tend to accept it as a fact without considering any view dissenting or contradicting it. Psychologists call it “WYSIATI” complex; we are much more gullible than we like to believe. But it is again the mischief of System 1 that leads us to believe a narrative impulsively and without further inquisition as to its authenticity. It is also another example of our intuitive tendency to see things in a narrow frame.Loss Aversion: Call it a gift of evolution or survival instinct, but we are naturally loss averse in most of our decisions. We are more likely to abandon a huge profit if there is some probability of an equally huge loss. We do want to have more, but not at the cost of putting our own at stake, we relish our possessions more than our desire to have more. Overconfidence and Hindsight bias: A general limitation of our mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. We see people everyday saying that what just happened was what they always thought would happen and they, in their overconfidence, start believing that they always knew in hindsight that such an event was probable. (see Halo Effect) Prospect theory: This theory attempts to explain the way people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. Kahneman illustrates it through this graph This theory is one of his most important in the field of behavioral economics. Owing to its complexity, I can not summarize it here. P.S I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in Behavioral Psychology. Don’t waste your time on self-help books when you can read the real stuff.!121!Thinking, Fast and Slow is just okay. It's being marketed as a book on psychology (and economic psychology, in particular) for the layperson. I'm not sure if other laypeople agree, but this wasn't really for me. And it's not that the prose is too technical (okay, sometimes it is) but rather that Kahneman is stuck somewhere between academic technicalities and clear expressive prose. Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook!121!I came across Thinking, Fast and Slow when I was reading about Richard Thaler’s work and his contribution to behavioural economics. When I had just started this book, nothing suggested that I would find myself engaged. Daniel Kahneman gives a description of our behavioural patterns and the reasons behind the decisions we, human beings, make. Do we always behave in a rational way? What is the difference between “Econs” and “Humans”? Complex theories and concepts are explained in relatively simple language and accompanied by many examples. There is no need for any special knowledge to absorb this work of non-fiction and enjoy the process of reading, although it contains a lot of statistics.The main characters of the book, according to the author, are two modes of reasoning - System 1 and System 2 - the two systems of our brain. The latter is very slow and prone to analytical reasoning, whereas the former is much faster and intuitive. System 1 often replaces a difficult or an ambiguous question with a simpler one and promptly answers this ‘new’ simplified question. Decisions that System 1 tends to take are often based on intuition. Such an approach may prove itself viable, for example, when it comes to chess grandmasters with vast experience. However, often we should not rely on this mode of reasoning, especially when making important decisions, such as choosing an insurance or retirement plan. System 2, ready to thoroughly analyse facts and compare different options, is at our disposal to help make choices that are going to have a substantial impact on our lives. The tricky part is that to be able to switch between the two systems humans have at least to make an effort to distinguish between them. The best option seems to let these two modes cooperate, but it is not as easy as one might think. What about rationality? For decades, the leading economists have been telling us about the idea of maximising profits as the key principle propelling people to take an action. Kahneman tests this statement and shows that humans are often irrational in their decisions and actions, not striving to benefit themselves most but driven by their emotions and preconceptions. Moreover, sometimes random factors turn out to be crucial and determine our behaviour. Ordinary people, unlike ‘fictional’ economic agents, are not rational, events do not always have a causal connection, and stories of our lives often lack coherence and formal logic.Our brain is inclined to produce cognitive illusions that come on the scene on different occasions. The effect of framing is one of the prominent examples of such cognitive traps. It results in people changing their decision or their answer if the offer that has been made to them or question they have been asked is simply reworded. In other words, another formulation of exactly the same thesis can lead to opposite results. This is how our brain works whether we like it or not. In conclusion, this is one of those books capable of helping us understand ourselves slightly better.!121!Whew! Wrestled this one down to the ground. It's got so much in it; I've got all I can for now. I'm leaving it out in the living room for now, though--for refreshers.The author's aim is to prove to us that we are not rational beings to the extent we think we are, that evolution has seen to that. And that being the case, the book outlines what we need to know so as not to mess up decisions like we have been doing--like we all do. And he's made it accessible. He pulls you in. You will get your share of ""Aha!"" moments. You can read it at whatever level you want. You can skim over the more complicated parts and go for the pithy conclusions. Or if you are really into the science and scholarship, there are footnotes in the back--stealth footnotes without the little numbers on the book's pages, so as not to intimidate the general audience. All based on science. It's true whether you like it or not. And it is applicable to your life. You can't go over it, you can't go under it, so go through it--with this book. If we all used our brains just a little more, what couldn't we accomplish! News for August 9, 2013: Daniel Kahneman is one of the sixteen Medal of Freedom recipients for this year -- http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/ar... .February 11, 2019: Heard on NPR (Krista Tippett's On Being) Sunday a week ago -- a good review/overview https://onbeing.org/programs/daniel-k...!121!It's a fascinating study of the mind, how people make decisions, and how the decision-making process can be improved.!121!This book had me laughing and smiling, more than many a book described in its blurb as side-splittingly funny or something similar because I recognised the cognitive disillusions described in this book as my own and in any case I am the kind of person who if they fall into a good mood wonders if it's due to the pint and the pie that was eaten earlier.In my case the preacher wasn't talking to the choir, but I had been to the church before and enjoyed the services. It doesn't set out to be a new book full of new discoveries. It's a comfortable round up of research, investigations and thought, polished off with a couple of Kahneman's early articles as appendices. If you've read The Halo Effect ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers(which puts some of these cogitative delusions in a business context, it has an excellent anecdote about the failure of a Lego product), or something along those lines you'll be familiar with some of the ideas here.By now I'm quite comfortable accepting that I am not rational and that other people aren't either and that statistical thinking is alien to probably to almost everybody and Kahneman's book happily confirms my opinion. And few things make us as happy as having our own biases confirmed to us.There are however a couple of problems. Firstly there are some people who apparently are wedded to the notion that people are entirely rational. They either will not read this book, read and reject it or indeed read it, accept it's findings but mentally note them as curious aberrations that don't affect their belief - this is discussed in the book.More seriously society is organised on the tacit assumption that we are not only capable of being rational but will put the effort into doing so when required. Unfortunately studies demonstrating the effect of meals on Judges reviewing parole cases (like the state pawn broker in Down and out in Paris and London they are more lenient after lunch and harsher beforehand and once they get hungry again) or voter behaviour which turns out to be influenced by where the polling booth is located. This makes me wonder. My polling station used to be in the Adult Education Centre, now that's been closed down, if the polling centre was moved to the police station would my voting habits transform into those of a Fishin', Huntin' and Floggin' Tory who froths at the mouth hearing the words 'illegal immigrants'? Maybe I need a snack. Much in the book is useful, 90% fat free does sound better than 10% fat, there's a lot to be learnt here in how to describe or state a problem to push people towards certain responses by framing or anchoring the information you give. Of course this happens to us all the time as it is. One of my favourite of Kahneman's examples comes from when he was working with Israeli flight instructors. They were convinced that shouting and swearing at trainee pilots was the best method of improving their performance - experience proved it - when a pilot under performed they swore at him and on the next attempt the trainee would do better. Plainly shouting works. Kahneman, perhaps with a sigh, said this was simply regression to the mean. After poor performance what ever they did would be followed by improved performance, swearing and shouting have no magic power. To demonstrate he had the instructors throw balls of paper over their shoulder's into a waste paper bin and tracked the results on a handy black board showing that performance varied up and down irrespective of swearing. Still I wonder if returning to work the instructors developed an enlightened instruction method or if they rapidly regressed to the mean and shouted and swore again.I used to think that politicians answered a different question to the one given by the interviewer in an attempt to be evasive. Post Kahneman I wonder if this is just the natural tendency of the brain to substitute an easier question for a harder one. Who knows.!121!This is an excellent book about how we think, written by a Nobel-prize-winning economist. Kahneman explains how two ""systems"" in the mind make decisions. ""System 1"" is the fast, intuitive aspect of the mind. ""System 2"" is the slower, logical and reasoning part of the mind. We generally make decisions quickly with the System 1, often because System 2 is simply--lazy. It takes effort to think things out rationally, and our rational minds are not always up to the job. This book is a long, comprehensive explanation of why we make decisions the way we do. Both systems are necessary, but both are subject to fallacies. Kahneman explains many of these fallacies. Most people do not really understand probability, so we are not good at judging relative levels of risk. Our decisions are strongly colored by how we frame questions in our minds. Simply re-framing a question can easily cause people--even professionals like doctors--to reverse decisions. We need to understand these framing issues, to avoid bad decisions. Elements of causality and Bayesian probability are described in some detail.One of the most interesting aspects of the ways we think, is the concept of availability. Often, when subjected to a difficult question, we answer immediately. But really, we do not answer the question at hand--we have made a subtle switch to a simpler question, without even realizing it. Kahneman describes this quick switch to an available answer, in quite a bit of detail. Another interesting aspect is what he calls ""hedonic"" theory. Our memories of pleasant and unpleasant experiences are very much colored by their peak intensities and their ends--but definitely not by their durations. In other words, a short, very unpleasant experience is remembered as being much worse than an very long duration, unpleasant experience.Some of the explanations of our ways of thinking may seem basic and obvious if you have read other psychology books. But then you realize--Kahneman and his colleague Amos Tversky discovered these aspects of psychology, by conducting a wide variety of clever experiments. Very well written, and understandable to the non-specialist, I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in psychology.!121!Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.
I think this book is mistitled. For years, I assumed that it was some kind of self-help book about when to trust your gut and when to trust your head, and thus I put off reading it. But Thinking, Fast and Slow is nothing of the sort. As I finally discovered when the book was gifted to me (the ecstatic blurbs in the front pages were the first clue), this book is the summary of Daniel Kahneman’s study of cognitive errors. The book should probably be called: Thinking, Just Not Very Well.Granted, my initial impression had a grain of truth. Kahneman’s main focus is on what we sometimes call our gut. This is the “fast thinking” of the title, otherwise known as our intuition. Unlike many books on the market, which describe the wonders of human intuition and judgment, Kahneman’s primary focus was on how our intuition can systematically fail to draw correct conclusions. So you might say that this is a book about all of the reasons you should distrust your gut.Every researcher of the mind seems to divide it up into different hypothetical entities. For Freud it was the conscious and unconscious, while for Kahneman there are simply System 1 and System 2. The former is responsible for fast thinking—intuition, gut feelings—and the second is responsible for slow thinking—deliberative thought, using your head. System 2, while admirably thorough and logical, is also effortful and sluggish. Trying any unfamiliar mental task (such as mental arithmetic) can convince you of this. Thus, we must rely on our fast-acting System 1 for most of any given day.System 1 generates answers to questions without any experience of conscious deliberation. Most often these answers are reasonable, such as when answering the question “What you like a hamburger?” (Answer: yes). But, as Kahneman demonstrates, there are many situations in which the answer that springs suddenly to mind is demonstrably false. This would not be a problem if our conscious System 2 detected these falsehoods. Yet our default position is to simply go with our intuition unless we have a strong reason to believe our intuition is misleading. Unfortunately, the brain has no warning system to tell you that your gut feeling is apt to be unreliable. You can call these sorts of situations “cognitive illusions.”A common theme in these cognitive illusions is a failure of our intuition to deal with statistical information. We are good at thinking in terms of causes and comparisons, but situations involving chance throw us off. As an example, imagine a man who is shy, quiet, and orderly. Is he more likely to be a librarian or a farmer? Now consider the answer that springs to mind (librarian, I assume): how was it generated? Your mind compared the description to the stereotype of a librarian, and made the judgment. But this judgment did not take into account the fact that there are many times more farmers than male librarians.Another example of this failure of intuition is the mind’s tendency to generate causal stories to explain random statistical noise. A famous example of this is the “hot hand” in basketball: interpreting a streak of successful shots as due to the player being especially focused, rather than simply as a result a luck. (Although subsequent research has shown that there was something to the idea, after all. So maybe we should not lament too much about our intuitions!) Another well-known example is the tendency for traders to attribute their success or failure in the stock market to skill, while Kahneman demonstrated that the rankings of a group of traders from year to year had no correlation at all. The basic point is that we are generally hesitant to attribute something to chance, and instead invent causal stories that “explain” the variation.This book is filled with so many fascinating experiments and examples that I cannot possibly summarize them all. Suffice to say that the results are convincing, not only because of the weight of evidence, but mainly because Kahneman is usually able to demonstrate the principle at work on the reader. Our intuitive reactions are remarkably similar, apparently, and I found that I normally reacted to his questions in the way that he predicted. If you are apt to believe that you are a rational person (as I am) it can be quite depressing.After establishing the groundwork, Kahneman sets his sights on the neighboring discipline of economics. Conventional economic theory presupposes rational actors who are able to weigh risks and to act in accordance with their desires. But, as Kahneman found, this does hold with actual people. Not only do real humans act irrationally, but real humans deviate from the expected predictions of the rational agent model systematically. This means that we humans are (to borrow a phrase from another book in this vein) predictably irrational. Our folly is consistent.One major finding is that people are loss-averse. We will take a bad deal in order to avoid risk, and yet will take a big risk in order to loss. This behavior seems to be motivated by an intense fear of regret, and it is the cause of a certain amount of conservatism, not only in economics, but in life. If an action turns out badly, we tend to regret it more of it was an exceptional rather than a routine act (picking up a hitchhiker rather than driving to work, for example), and so people shy away from abnormal options that carry uncertainty.Yet, logically speaking, there is no reason to regret a special action more than a customary one, just as there is no reason to weigh losses so much more heavily than gains. Of course, there is good evolutionary logic for these tendencies. In a dangerous environment, losing a gamble could mean losing your life, so it is best to stay to the tried-and-true. But in an economic context, this strategy is not usually optimal.The last section of the book was the most interesting of all, at least from a philosophical perspective. Kahneman investigates how our memories systematically misrepresent our experiences, which can cause a huge divergence between experienced happiness and remembered joy. Basically, when it comes to memory, intensity matters more than duration, and the peaks and ends of experiences matter more than their averages. The same applies with pain: We may remember one experience as less painful than another just because the pain was mild when it ended. And yet, in terms of measured pain per minute, the first experience may actually have included more experiential suffering.As a result of this, our evaluations of life satisfaction can often have very little to do with our real, experiential well being. This presents us with something of a paradox, since we often do things, not for how much joy they will bring us in the moment, but for the nice memory they will create. Think about this: How much money would you spend on a vacation if you knew that every trace of the experience would be wiped out as soon as the vacation ended, including photos and even your memories? The answer for most people is not much, if anything at all. This is why so many people (myself included) frantically take photos on their vacations: the vacation is oriented toward a future remembering-self. But perhaps it is just as well that humans were made this way. If I made my decisions based on what was most pleasant to do in the moment, I doubt I would have made my way through Kant.This is just a short summary of the book, which certainly does not do justice to the richness of Kahneman’s many insights, examples, and arguments. What can I possibly add? Well, I think I should begin with my few criticisms. Now, it is always possible to criticize the details of psychological experiments—they are artificial, they mainly use college students, etc. But considering the logistical restraints of doing research, I thought that Kahneman’s experiments were all quite expertly done, with the relevant variables controlled and additional work performed to check for competing explanations. So I cannot fault this.What bothered me, rather, was that Kahneman was profuse in diagnosing cognitive errors, but somewhat reticent when it came to the practical ramifications of these conclusions, or to strategies to mitigate these errors. He does offer some consequences and suggestions, but these are few and far between. Of course, doing this is not his job, so perhaps it is unfair to expect anything of the kind from Kahneman. Still, if anyone is equipped to help us deal with our mental quagmires, he is the man.This is a slight criticism. A more serious shortcoming was that his model of the mind fails to account for a ubiquitous experience: boredom. According to Kahneman’s rough sketch, System 1 is pleased by familiarity, and System 2 is only activated (begrudgingly, and without much relish) for unfamiliar challenges. Yet there are times when familiarity can be crushing and when novel challenges can be wonderfully refreshing. The situation must be more subtle: I would guess that we are most happy with moderately challenging tasks that take place against a familiar background. In any case, I think that Kahneman overstated our intellectual laziness.Pop psychology—if this book can be put under that category—is a genre I dip into occasionally. Though there is a lot of divergence in emphasis and terminology, the consensus is arguably more striking. Most authors seem to agree that our conscious mind is rather impotent compared to all of the subconscious control exerted by our brains. Kahneman’s work in the realm of judgments closely parallels Johathan Haidt’s work in morals: that our conscious mind mostly just passively accepts verdicts handed up from our mental netherworld. Indeed, arguably this was Freud’s fundamental message, too. Yet it is so contrary to all of our conscious experiences (as, indeed, it must be) that it still manages to be slightly disturbing.Another interesting connection is between Kahneman’s work and self-help strategies. It struck me that these cognitive errors are quite directly related to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which largely consists of getting patients to spot their own mental distortions (most of which are due to our mind’s weakness with statistics) and correct them. And Kahneman’s work on experiential and remembered well being has obvious relevance to the mindfulness movement—strategies for switching our attention from our remembering to our experiencing “self.” As you can see from these connections, Kahneman’s research is awfully rich.Though perhaps not as amazing as the blurbs would have you believe, I cannot help but conclude that this is a thoroughly excellent book. Kahneman gathers many different strands of research together into a satisfying whole. Who would have thought that a book about all the ways that I am foolish would make me feel so wise?!121!What a monstrous chore to read! I've been working on this book since September or August (4-6 months) and just could not take reading it for more than a few minutes at a time. Many times did it put me to sleep. The book covered a lot of great material and really fascinating research, but oftentimes in such plodding, pedantic, meticulous detail as to nearly obfuscate the point. I have heard of the majority of the research (or at least their conclusions) as well, so while I thought it offered excellent insight and useful material for a lot of people to learn, I didn't think this collection of it--more of a history of the field than an introduction--added anything novel or unique for one already well-versed in the material. I guess I didn't care for the details in how the studies were conducted for every minor point in the author's theories--though I largely agreed with the theories and interpretations. A line near the end of the book struck a dissonant chord with me and I wonder if that offers an additional cause for my dislike: ""That was my reason for writing a book that is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than to decision makers."" I wouldn't count myself among 'decision makers' in any important sense (it's surprising how little responsibility a person can have sometimes!), but I often felt like the book wasn't speaking to me. Many times the author wrote ""we think..."" or ""we act..."" in such a way that I don't think I'd do. This isn't to say I'm a purely 'rational agent' or 'Econ' or anything like that--the majority of the authors theories (thinking can be either instinctual or effortful, rational agents act differently than emotional humans, and the experiencing self and the remembering self are different things) are immanently true--but I do think he was generalizing for a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) audience, and despite my background, I don't think I think that way. Recommendation: read the introduction and the conclusion (and perhaps the major section intros), cherry-pick anything else of interest.!121!Reading ""Thinking, Fast, and Slow"", ....(book choice for this month's local book club), was not exactly bedtime reading for me. I had already pre- judged it before I started reading... ( certain I would discover I'm a FAST INTUITIVE - type thinker ... ( quick, often influenced by emotion). Once in awhile I use basic common sense - logic .... but even, it is usually with 'righteous emotions'. Just being honest!I understand this is an intellectual -giant- of - a -book about ""How we think""...Thinking 'deeply' about how we think... but this book hasn't changed me - transformed me--or enlighten me. Not so far. It's too technical. I understand the author is brilliant --but I found myself skimming pages-- However, what I understood - I enjoyed. Kahneman has a great talent at being a slow, rational, logical, and reflective thinker. However, fast thanking, intuitive thinking, is more influential in what experience tells us he says---being contrary to the belief that we are very rational-decision making people. A few things in the book...interesting information ... Yet I still 'believe it's incomplete ...That their are other ways in speaking about the way our minds work - that is not found in this big book. 1) Two basic systems of thinking:  System 1 is the intuitive, quick, thinking System 2 is the slowest rational logical and reflective thinking .....20% of our Energy goes into our brain. .....We tend to be lazy thinkers. ( lazy controller he calls it), and do not involve our slow thinking brain and less it is needed. ...... A running theme in the book is that although the brain does contain a statisticalalgorithm, it is not accurate. The brain does not understand basic normal distribution. ...... Our brain often jumps to conclusions. ...... Our brain knows how to answer easy questions, like ""what did you have for breakfast""?...but it is more challenging to answer the question, ""how do you feel about yourself today""?......We have biases...... Often stereotypes will override statistics. ( again providing we have influential, lazy judging brains) ....... He talks about predictions. For example, if a child gets great grades in the lower grades of school... We often tend to over estimate our ability to predict the future. ...... When it comes to intuition versus formulas ... Often the formula does win. ..... We also are incline to expect regularity much more in our lives and really exist. You won't find any data in this book about ""The Power of Now"" thinking, or discussion about ""You are not your Mind"", Chakras, or myths about healing ... but it's a book about THE WAY WE THINK... (technical.. some of it I resonated with- but when it got too scientifically technical, he lost me). I look forward to my book club discussion- 25 people will be attending this month- (many bright people)... I'm sure to gain value and more insights.!121!Often I find myself in conversations with people who are criminally opinionated, but have little in the way of empirical grounding. It’s common, in these situations, to hear them malign opponents of their views by reducing the conflict to a single factor; My opponent is so dumb they couldn’t follow a chemical gradient if they were bacteria! Now, putting aside the fact that single factor analysis is a mugs game when discussing things of any complexity (which is basically everything), when resorting to these oversimplifications with human behavior, you asymptotically approach infinite incorrectness. My common refrain in these times is to dip into my quote bag and castigate the misguided with Popper’s glib witticism: “A theory that explains everything, explains nothing.” Or, channeling the Arch Bishop of astuteness, John Stuart Mill, I rise up, gesturing dramatically and pitching my voice just so: “He who knows only his side of the case knows little of that.” Hoping their snotty self assurance will recede before my rational indignation like an anabolic hairline.This shit never works. Putting aside the fact that I’m subject to the same cognitive limitations, quotations often arrive on the scene like a flaccid member, with intimations of a proper impression hidden somewhere in that bloodless noodle, if only the other party would play with it. But, much like idioms, there’s just not enough chemistry to warrant heavy petting.Next I will resort to recalling numerous studies which have totally pin-cushioned the quaint notion that we are dispassionate, logical thinkers. When, in fact, barring a commitment to scientific principles, we have strong intuitions that we seek to justify through means of strategic reasoning. “We’re more like lawyers than Vulcans.” I say solemnly. Starring off into the distance for dramatic effect. Pensive. Avoiding eye contact for an appropriate interval before turning to peer into their soul and nod as we grasp, however tenuously, our feeble position before the Logos. Inevitably, when this numinous moment arrives, I am instead greeted with a vacant stare, or, much worse, an objection! Which, if you’ve been following me so far, means that I switch from attempting to persuade and instead silently chide my opponent for being a hopeless imbecile.How do we opt out of being unrelenting self righteous pricks? Well, we probably can’t fully, the gravity is just too strong. Escape velocity would require some fundamental redesigns to a cognitive apparatus which evolved to intuit a subset of phenomena on the African savanna which bore a relationship to our reproductive success. But we can sure as hell beat one another with books like this until we piss blood and can’t hold our toothbrushes due to nasty rotator cuff injuries. That’ll teach us. I consider this to be the Mac Daddy of bibliophilic bludgeoning implements on this topic. I once blasted a man in the chest so hard with the spine of this book that, in addition to the bastard rolling clean over a Pizza Hut table like it was the hood of a speeding vehicle, the pages burst from between the covers like a fox vomiting hen feathers. So incensed by this needless destruction of literary property, I stood over the man and berated him on the importance of properly breaking in the spines of hardcovers. As he wormed about in pepperoni and soda, nodding (if for no other reason than to avoid another terrible sounding of his sternum) I also took the time to explain the central message of this book:“Look, man. You need to realize that we’ve got these two modes of cognition. One is accessible to us. It’s slow and deliberative and subject to systematic interventions of logic if we but choose to learn and apply them. The other does pretty much whatever it damn well pleases based on input it receives from the environment that you’re often not consciously aware of. It’s good when it’s helping you get out of the way of deranged book wielders, but it’s bad when it goes awry in matters that are deeply counter intuitive (much of modern life) and mucks about with your ability to properly steer the system you have access to.”This is an important book. Humanity would be much improved if these insights could percolate through society and really take hold. But they probably won’t. Because we’re assholes.!121!Thinking, Fast and Slow by Nobel Prize Winner Daniel Kahneman is a lifetime's worth Of Wisdom. I purchased a paper copy of this book after I came across this book preparing for IELTS. The tone of the book is very official. Thus, it is a good read before preparing for the English exam. Thinking, Fast and Slow introduces two systems of our brains. System one and System two. The first one is fast and the second one is slow. There are a plethora of authors' examples, that he accumulated thought his professional life. It was pleasant, yet, difficult to read. I struggled to finish because of the official language.!121!""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is one of the best books I ever read. I have read it 3x now. It's the gift that keeps on giving. The conclusions of the specific studies in the book are the meat. I constantly reference them in practical human matters all the time, especially in which we easily delude ourselves: the endowment effect, expert intuition, the law of small numbers, confirmation bias, the planning fallacy, risk aversion, loss aversion, sunk cost (throwing good money after bad), etc. These insights help us think more rationally and make better decisions, including in financial matters, where we might be prone to impulse, allowing our emotions get the better of us and really cost us.===========Kahneman questions the certitude of success based on formulae in business books and other business publications....https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...==========My own book is based on behavioral economics....https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...=======Kahneman excerpt....https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/ma...========How our brain tricks us into taking stupid riskshttps://www.propublica.org/article/ho...!121!Freeman “Dyson Sphere” Dyson wrote the New York Times review, which has me swooning right there. Dyson was a particularly apt pick because Kahneman helped design the Israeli military screening and training systems back when the country was young, and Dyson at 20 years old cranked statistics for the British Bombing Command in its youth. Dyson was part of a small group that figured out the bombers were wrong about what mattered to surviving night time raids over Germany; a thing only about a quarter of the crews did over a tour. Dyson figured out the Royal Airforce's theories about who lived and died were wrong. But no data driven changes were made because “the illusion of validity does not disappear just because facts prove it to be false. Everyone at Bomber Command, from the commander in chief to the flying crews, continued to believe in the illusion. The crews continued to die, experienced and inexperienced alike, until Germany was overrun and the war finally ended.” http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... Why did the British military resist the changes? Because it was deeply inconsistent the heroic story of the RAF they believed in. Suppose there are stories I’d die for too. But not the myth that Kahneman dethroned. Kahneman got the Nobel Prize for Economics for showing that the Rational Man of Economics model of human decision making was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human decision making. We are not evolved to be rational wealth maximizers, and we systematically value and fear some things that should not be valued so highly or feared so much if we really were the Homo Economicus the Austrian School seems to think we should be. Which is personally deeply satisfying, because I never bought it and deeply unsettling because of how many decisions are made based on that vision. If that was all this book was, it’d just be another in a mass of books that have as their thesis “You’re wrong about that!” Which I appreciate knowing, but there’s a point where it’s a little eye rolling because they don’t offer any helpful suggestions on how not to be wrong, or why these patterns of wrongness exist and endure. But Kahneman has a theory. He theorizes that humans have two largely separate decision-making systems: System One (the fast) and System Two (the slow). System One let us survive monster attacks and have meaningful relationships with each other. System Two got us to the moon. Both systems have values built into them and any system of decision-making that edits them out is doomed to undercut itself. Some specifics that struck me:Ideomotor Effect: (53) Concepts live in our heads in associative networks. Once triggered, they cascade concepts. Make someone walk slow, they think about old age. Make someone smile, and they’ll be happier. Seeing a picture of cash makes us more independent, more selfish, and less likely to pick up something someone else has dropped. Seeing a locker makes us more likely to vote for school bonds. Reminding people of their mortality makes them more receptive of authoritarian ideas.” (56) “Studies of priming effects have yielded discoveries that threaten our self-image as conscious and autonomous authors of our judgments and our choices.” (55). Halo Effect (82) “If you like the president’s politics, you probably like his voice and appearance as well.” We find someone attractive and we conclude they’re competent. We find emotional coherence pleasing and lack of coherence frustrating. However, far fewer things are correlated than we believe. What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI) (85). Our system one is pattern seeking. Our system 2 is lazy; happy to endorse system 1 beliefs without doing the hard math. “Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes up so often in this book, that I will use a cumbersome abbreviation for it: WYSIATI. . . System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and quantity of information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions.” (86). Absolutely essentially for not getting eaten by lurking monsters, and “explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. Much of the time, the coherent story we put together is close enough to reality to support reasonable action.” Except when it doesn’t. Like in our comparative risk assessments. We panic about shark attacks and fail to fear riptides; freak out about novel and unusual risks and opportunities and undervalue the pervasive ones. Answering an Easier Question (97). If one question is hard, we’ll substitute an easier one. It can be a good way to make decisions. Unless the easier question is not a good substitute. I have an uneasy awareness that I do this. Especially since it often REALLY ANNOYS me when people do it to me. The Law of Small Numbers. (109) The counties with the lowest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Good clean living? The counties with the highest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Lack of access to health care? Wait, what? The System 1 mind immediately comes up with a story to explain the difference. But once the numbers are cranked, apparently, it’s just an artifact of the fact that a few cases in a small county skews the rate. But if you base your decision on either story, the outcomes will be bad. Anchors (119). We seize on the first value offered, no matter how obviously absurd it is. If you want to push someone in a direction, get them to accept your anchor. Regression to the Mean. (175) There will be random fluctuations in the quality of performance. A teacher who praises a randomly good performance may shape behavior, but likely will simply be disappointed as statistics asserts itself and a bad performance follows. A teacher who criticizes a bad performance may incentivize, but likely will simply have a false sense of causation when statistics asserts itself and a good performance happens. Kahneman describes it as “a significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us too is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.” (176). The Illusion of Understanding (204) The sense-making machinery of System 1 makes us see the world as more tidy, simple, predictable, and coherent than it really is. The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can control the future. These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence. We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and courage.” But it doesn’t . (212). For example, we’re totally wrong about whether you can beat the stock market. Formulas are often much more predictive than learned intuition. I’m going to have to wrestle with this one, but he alluded to a claim by Robyn Dawes that “marital stability is well predicted by a formula: frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels.” (226) Snicker. Premortems Can Help. (264) before making a decision, assign someone to imagine it’s a year into the future and the plan was a disaster. Have them write a history of the disaster. We value losses more than gains. (349) Which is fine except when that means we expose others to more risk because we did the math wrong. The Focusing Illusion (402) “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.” We overvalue what’s in our mind at the moment, which is subject to priming. He closes by stressing he does not mean to say that people are irrational. But, he says, “rational” in economic terms has a particular meaning that does not describe people. “For economists and decision theorists, [rationality] has an altogether different meaning. The only test of rationality is not whether a person’s beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are internally consistent. A rational person can believe in ghosts, so long as all her other beliefs are consistent with the existence of ghosts. . . . Rationality is logical coherence – reasonable or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. . . . 	“The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to implement. Reasonable people cannot be rational by that definition, but they should not be branded as irrational for that reason. Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasoned argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos [Tversky] is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model.” (411) 	A good read.!121!1- دانیل کانمن در این کتاب به خطاهایی می‌پردازد که ما انسانها به دلیل کارکرد فعال سیستم 1 و تنبلی سیستم 2 انجام می‌دهیم. خطاهایی که حتی ما انسانها بعضیها را به عنوان خطا نمی‌شناسیم، باور داریم و البته به طور روزمره با آنها مواجهیم. از نظر کانمن راه جلوگیری از خطاهایی که از سیستم 1 سرچشمه می‌گیرند، در کل ساده است. نشانه‌هایی که حاکی از میدان مین ذهنی است شناسایی کنید، آرام شوید و بکوشید از سیستم 2 کمک بگیرید. متأسفانه این فرایند عاقلانه در اوقاتی که به آن نیاز است، بسیار کم مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد. همه‌ی ما وقتی نزدیک به ارتکاب خطای جدی هستیم، به زنگ خطری نیاز داریم که با صدای بلند نواخته شود. اما چنین زنگ خطری موجود نیست و خطاهای ذهنی، در کل، بسیار دشوارتر از خطاهای درکی تشخیص داده می‌شوند.2- کتاب ۳۷ فصل دارد و در هر فصل یک موضوع مطرح می‌شود. به همین دلیل این کتاب حجیم (ترجمه ۶۸۰ صفحه ای) هرچه جلوتر می‌رویم جذابتر می‌شود. یکی از ویژگیهای خوب کتاب این است که در انتهای هر فصل در چند جمله‌ی کوتاه، مثالهایی درباره موضوع بحث ذکر می‌شود که برای درک بهتر مطالب و مرور مجدد مفاهیم در آینده بسیار کمک می‌کند.3- متاسفانه ترجمه خانم تالوصمدی خوب نیست و بعضی جاها کلافه می‌کند؛ اشتباههای املایی و حتی محتوایی هم دیده می‌شود که شاید به خاطر سبک نگارش سخت کتاب توسط کانمن باشد. امیدوارم در چاپهای مجدد این مشکلات مورد بازبینی و تصحیح قرار بگیرند. جاهایی که شک داشتید یا متوجه نشدید را با متن انگلیسی تطبیق بدهید. فایل کتاب را برای دانلود در آدرس زیر قرار دادم.https://goo.gl/52G5q24- کانمن می‌نویسد: «تصمیم‌گیری مانند سخن گفتن به نثر است. افراد بدون اینکه از آن آگاه باشند و حتی هنگام آگاه بودن، پیوسته این کار را انجام می‌دهند.» همانطور که انتظار داریم جان مطالب کتاب در فصل «نتیجه‌گیریها» آورده شده است. نگارنده در این فصل به این موضوع می‌پردازد که با وجود اینهمه خطا در رفتار انسانها، آیا باید آنها را برای انتخاب و تصمیم‌گیری آزاد گذاشت یا جامعه‌ی مسئول باید به افراد برای انتخاب صحیح کمک کند؟!121!I could not bring myself to finish this book. The book is filled with shady experiments on undergraduates and psychology grad students and wild extrapolations of the associated results. I find it exceedingly difficult to take many of the conclusions seriously. I can't read into them. I can't trust them. I can't base my decisions on them and I resist incorporating them into my world view with anything more than 0.01 weight. In fact, several of the experiments that this book mentions were also found to be not reproducible by a recent meta-study on reproducibility in psychology studies.Here's a characteristic example of me reading the book. The author says: ""Consider the word EAT. Now fill in the blank in the following: SO_P. You were much more likely to fill in the blank with a U to make SOUP than with an A to make soap! How amazing. We call this phenomenon priming, system 1, something something"". In fact, no, SOAP came to my mind immediately.All I could think about when I read this book is my own experience of participating in a friend's psychology study once. He designed an experiment and asked me to do some things and answer some questions, but at some point it became extremely clear to me what the experiment was about, or how he hoped I would behave. I went along with it, but I couldn't believe that this would eventually become part of a paper. It was a joke. I'm afraid you can't go through a similar experience and take these studies seriously from then on.All that being said I do find the broad strokes of the system1/system2 division proposed in this book to be interesting and appealing. A small few of the examples were fun to contemplate, and it was okay. 3/5, aborting reading.!121!My issue with this book, which is one I've tossed aside after 60 pages, is not so much that it's poorly done or that it's hard to understand - in fact, the exact opposite is true.The issue is that this book is simply more in depth about psychology and psychological processes than I truly have a short-term interest in. This is more the type of book you keep near your desk or bedside, read a 12 page chapter or so, and digest. This may be a book I need to own and do that with as opposed to tear through it after borrowing it from the library and then hating myself as a slog through it.!121!Mr. Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner, explores the general subject of how and why we frequently make irrational decisions. We've all seen articles over the years on various aspects of this phenomenon, but I venture to say that never before have the various aspects and permutations been explored in this depth and specificity. Mr. Kahneman has spent much of his life researching the subject, and since the book includes both his research and that of others, it must stand as the definitive compendium on the subject. His credentials are indisputable, and he tries gamely to bring the subject to life, but -- mea culpa -- I just couldn't stay interested in the myriad of data and specific examples. The book is good for someone really interested in the details, and it does contain real life examples, but after 400 pages it's hard to remember them. My takeaway: Our intuition is frequently wrong, and even our experience (or what we believe our experience to have been) may not be reliable as a decision guide. So, be careful!!121!A long book that requires real mental exertion, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a worthwhile read by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. It delves into the two complex systems of the mind. System 1 is impulsive, emotional, and often led astray, while System 2 is rational, thoughtful, and takes more time to makes decisions. He analyzes how humans use (and sometimes fail to use) both systems, and the resulting implications on topics ranging from how we perceive happiness to behavioral economics.Thinking, Fast and Slow is one of the most in-depth Psychology books I've read. I fell in love with the subject after taking AP Psychology last year as a junior in high school, and am currently craving more books and articles related to the field. Daniel Kahneman satisfied my thirst. I had a solid understanding of some concepts beforehand, like the confirmation bias and hindsight bias, but had never heard of other terms like base rate or the illusion of validity. The sheer amount of statistics and experiments referenced throughout the book proved Kahneman's thoroughness and dedication.I recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow to anyone who wants to learn about how we think, or about psychology in general. I liked how Kahneman progressed from simple ideas like heuristics to more complex concepts, like prospect theory. Even if you have no background in psychology or economics, a mere interest in either should suffice for this book.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice.!121!Definitivamente o melhor livro sobre comportamento, cérebro e economia.

"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (Paperback)",Jared Diamond,4.04,408045,1997,"""Diamond has written a book of remarkable scope ... one of the most important and readable works on the human past published in recent years.""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a national bestseller: the global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race.In this ""artful, informative, and delightful"" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed writing, technology, government, and organized religion—as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war—and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth Club of California's Gold Medal","This is what happens when you take an intelligent person, and casually make a few mentions of a field of study they have no knowledge of.Mr. Diamond, NOT an anthropologist, takes Marvin Harris' theory of cultural materialism and uses it to explain everything in life, history, and the current state of the world.Materialism is a way of looking at human culture which, for lack of a better way to explain it easily here, says that people's material needs and goods determine behavior and culture. For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure.!121![Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions._________________________________[Update, Sep 22 2021]And following on from that, anyone who's read this book will think of an argument in favor of the antivax movement that I'm surprised not to have seen more antivaxers pushing. Diamond tells us that the Europeans conquered the world largely due to the fact that they had bigger cities, which could breed deadlier germs. Everywhere the Europeans went, their germs went with them and killed less disease-resistent indigenous populations. But now the largest cities are no longer in Europe, and the West is on the receiving end of natural bacteriological warfare. Even if vaccines offer a temporary respite, the best long-term strategy is to evolve as quickly as possible.Of course, that does mean allowing a lot of people to die, but it'll be in a good cause. The antivaxers just need to explain the reasoning clearly.!121!“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups? The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book. Here is a link to the first of its three episodes.Diamond's book Collapse, is also amazing.!121!Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid.!121!Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind.!121!Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world civilization and history has evolved? Jared Diamond’s work Guns, Germs and Steel argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in favor of Eurasia: climate, vegetation, topography, travel routes, variety of wild animals available to be domesticated, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. Were they going to harness a kangaroo or a koala? No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest in a broad east-west zone. Complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated and had steep mountains and other geographic barriers to trade and broad movement. Even the types of germs conspired to 'favor' European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations, which the Eurasians developed some immunity to, wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had relatively little impact in Eurasia. Many professional geographers and other academicians don’t like Diamond’s synthesis because it smacks too much of environmental determinism: the old “Northern peoples like the Vikings were warlike and fiercely independent; tropical folks were lazy and needed a whip to get them moving,"" etc.When what's done is done, a Monday morning quarterback can tell us exactly why it happened that way. But other scenarios were possible. If one pre-Columbus Chinese emperor had not decided that it was a waste of money to build huge sailing ships, China could have discovered California. (The book 1421 : The Year China Discovered the World by Gavin Menzies.) Then the 'USA' or whatever it would have been called, would have been settled from west to east. All of us in the US would be speaking Chinese. Our history would be the story of crossing the Rockies from west to east. Then Diamond could use these same explanations to demonstrate why it had to happen this way.A lot of ideas similar to Diamond’s can be found in older works such as Ellsworth Huntington’s 1945 book Mainsprings of Civilization. Even if you don’t agree with his conclusions, Diamond gives us a lot to think about in a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. Images: Map from slideplayer.comAn ancient Sumerian image from Wikipedia[Edited 7/29/23]!121!It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit.!121!Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared DiamondThe book attempts to explain why Eurasian and North African civilizations have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian hegemony is due to any form of Eurasian intellectual, moral, or inherent genetic superiority. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is a 1997 trans-disciplinary non-fiction book by Jared Diamond, professor of geography and physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles

را، به برتری «اروپایی‌ها»، و »آسیایی‌ها» از لحاظ اخلاقی، ذاتی، ژنتیکی، یا فکری نسبت می‌دهددایموند استدلال می‌کند، که شکاف در قدرت، و فناوری، بین جوامع انسانی، ریشه در تفاوت‌های زیست‌ محیطی دارد، تفاوت‌هایی که حلقه ی بازخورد مثبت آن‌ها را، تقویت می‌کند (به این معنا که برتری محیطی، باعث پیشرفت تکنولوژی می‌شود، و برتری تکنولوژی، باعث پیشرفت‌های بیشتری می‌شوند، که در جای خود پیشرفت بیشتری نیز به دنبال می‌آورد)؛ در مواردی که تفاوت‌های فرهنگی، یا ژنتیکی، به نفع اورآسیایی‌ه�� عمل کرده‌ است (به عنوان مثال دولت متمرکز در چین، یا مقاومت ژنتیکی در برابر بسیاری بیماری‌ها در میان اورآسیای‌ها)، این مزیت‌ها تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند، که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری («علمی»، «هنری»، «معماری»، «سیاسی»، و غیره) در قاره ی «اورآسیا» رخ داده‌ است؛ مردمان قاره‌ های دیگر (جنوب صحرای «آفریقا»، بومیان «آمریکا»، بومیان «استرالیا» و «گینه نو»، و ساکنین اصلی مناطق گرمسیری آسیای جنوب شرقی)، به‌ طور گسترده‌ ای مغلوب، و جا به‌ جا شده‌ اند، و در برخی موارد فوق‌ العاده (اشاره به بومیان «آمریکا»، بومیان «استرالیا» و بومیان «خوآسان» جنوب «آفریقا») عمدتاً از بین رفته‌ اندبرهان نخست این سلطه ی «اوراسیائی‌»ها، برتری‌های نظامی و سیاسی آن‌ها بوده، که خود ناشی از پیدایش زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ «دایموند» در این کتاب، برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت، و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به راههایی که به وسیله آن‌ها، «اروپایی‌»ها علی‌رغم تعداد نفرات کمتر، ملتهای دیگر را مغلوب کرده، و سلطه ی خود را حفظ کرده‌ اند، سلاح‌های برتر، مستقیماً منجر

ترویج داده، و بستری برای سازمان‌های قدرتمند نظامی به وجود می‌آورد (فولاد)؛کتاب از عوامل جغرافیایی استفاده می‌کند، تا نشان دهد، که چگونه «اروپایی‌»ها چنین تکنولوژی برتر نظامی‌ ای تولید کرده ‌اند، و چرا بیماریهایی که «اروپایی‌»ها، و «آسیایی‌»ها، نسبت به آن‌ها تا حدی از مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی «آمریکا» را ویران کردند؛ «اوراسیا» پس از آخرین عصر یخ، شانس برخورداری، از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی، و زیست‌ محیطی را، دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی «اوراسیا» را، دلایل اصلی توسعه زود هنگام کشاورزی، در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی، و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند «بز»، «سگ» یا بزرگتر)، در طبیعت «اوراسیا» یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را در اختیار مبتکران «اروپایی» و «آسیایی» کشاورزی، و به ویژه اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً «بین‌النهرین» و «ترکیه») گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی، عامل پر اهمیتتر بود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر «اوراسیا» در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن، یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردمان «اورآسیا» به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود، که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط «اوراسیا» اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی «آمریکا»، و تا حدی «آفریقا»، به دلیل تنوع گسترده، در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز «آفریقا»، یا «آمریکا» قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، «سرخپوستان» ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله، بر خلاف غلات «اوراسیا»، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، که کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است گفته شود، که پس از آنکه، به عنوان مثال در تمدن «می.سی.سی.پی»، در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ «اورآسیایی‌»ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ «اورآسیایی‌»ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد؛ چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در «اورآسیا» یافت می‌شده‌) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری، همچون «موز»، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای «آفریقا»، عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، «اورآسیا» بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد «اسب» و «شتر» که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، «بز» و «گوسفند» برای «پوست»، «پوشاک»، و «پنیر»؛ «گاو» برای «شیرش» و «ورزا» برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند «خوک‌»ها، و «مرغ» برای خوردن. «آفریقایی‌»ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با «شیر»، «پلنگ» و همانن اینها طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند، که تنها جانورانی مفید، برای استفاده ی بشر، در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق «آسیا» آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، به «گینه نو» وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب «دایموند» به طور خلاصه به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب «اروپا»، و نه «آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین)» بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب «آسیا»، «دایموند» پاسخ پرسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب «آسیا» را بسیار خشک، و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود، و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز «اروپا»، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق «آسیا»، «دایموند» حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با

The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals. Of course he is mostly right, but why in the 21st century is this considered such a novel idea, and why does he have to be so BORING about it? Don't believe the hype.!121!Misleading! The actual title should be Germs, More Germs and a bit about Steel And Guns, but not very much on those last two really...I mean, we want to put Guns first because it's more attention-grabbing than Germs, but let's face it, this book is mostly about Germs. Why has no publishing house knocked down my door trying to obtain my book titling services yet?!!121!Stopped on page 88 for the time being, because, man, do people ever suck. We historically sucked. But since humans used to invade other humans' territory and do a lot of killing, at least things have changed now.Oh, wait.!121!In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance.!121!This book explains why some countries became more powerful than others.The author says that it had to do with things like geography and the environment.Some places had more animals and plants to help people to survive and made them stronger.Other places did not have as much so they struggled more.This book is interesting and helps us to understand more history and geography about 13,000 years in the world.The author, Jared Diamond provides a fresh and insightful perspective on history and social science, making it a must-read for anyone interested in these subjects especially me.!121!Jared sticks to the basic premise and plugs every hole in his argument so well to construct a magnificent explanation of the evolution of societies. What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book.!121!Without overdoing the pun, everything by Diamond shines and shines. This is his greatest work. Occasionally in life you can feel a book shifting the way you see the world, shifting what you thought you knew about the world. There is a documentary made around this book, but read the book - trust me.!121!The PuristI give you now Professor Twist,A conscientious scientist,Trustees exclaimed, ""He never bungles!""And sent him off to distant jungles.Camped on a tropic riverside,One day he missed his loving bride.She had, the guide informed him later,Been eaten by an alligator.Professor Twist could not but smile.""You mean,"" he said, ""a crocodile.""That bit of Ogden Nash whimsy came into my head as I thought about Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, a reflection on human history through the lens of evolutionary biology. Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens.!121!Why didn't the indigenous people of the Americas, Oceania, and sub-equatorial Africa conquer Europe and its people? Why was it the other way around? Why didn't agriculture, cities, the wheel, writing, craftsmanship of metal processing originate in Europe? Why did it instead originate in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) and its surrounding areas? These are some very intriguing questions discussed in Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1997) written by Jared Diamond.This book is a brief history of the human evolution of the last 13,000 years with a focus on social evolution, ethnology, and ecology. The book also pays special attention to the regions which boarder the vast Pacific Ocean.Well, the Europeans discovered and conquered the Americas and Oceania because they were a more advance civilization. The Europeans had firearms, metal weapons, logistical technology that conquered land and sea, written language, centralized political power, and contagious diseases with which they infected and killed the natives, as the Europeans have already become genetically resistant to and acquired an immunity to those contagious diseases. The reason why the cradle of civilization originated in the Fertile Crescent is due to its specific geographical characteristics of the environment that had more favorable ecological conditions compared to other regions and Diamond states that it had nothing to do with the biology of those people. This region had access to metal based material for their tools and weapons. They were surrounded by animals that could be domesticated for defense, labour, and food. Last but not least, the Mesopotamians had local available plants that were edible and easily cultivated. All in all, in general, the Eurasians had a more favorable environment, a head start, a greater population, larger continent, and this is why they had an advantage on the people of the Americas, Oceania, and sub-equatorial Africa. I am assuming this is part of the story, but I can name several counter arguments. I was expecting a lot more, and I just wasn't satisfied with the arguments presented, nor were they all convincing. I can't recall any creative ideas or clever theories in this book. The influence of culture was discussed, but hardly religion or genetics. Diamond also very briefly discusses how the development of technology was amplified by a cumulative effect which reminded me of how well Richard Dawkins in The Blind Watchmaker (1986) explained the various positive feedback loops and the cumulative effect in biological evolution. The book is well-written and informative, this is a given, but many things are unnecessarily being repeated throughout the book with too many recapitulations. It could all have been more concise.(3.5/5.0)!121!This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies.!121!Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic.!121!“In short, Europe’s colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume. Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work.!121!On the Onerousness of Zebra Domestication and Other Such Digressions on the Nature of Wildly Divergent Cultural Outcomes Contingent on Flora and Fauna Nurtured by Disparate Geographical Conditions - Exordium.I, Zoologist supreme, heave into view of my motley assemblage of eager young minds. Hands clasped behind my back, the profile of my chin angled just so as I strafe back and forth before the striated equine beast.

Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space.!121!I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome.!121!I have found this book a bit difficult to write about. It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north-south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suggest that each reader will make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually.!121!Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended.!121!What a terrific book. 😍One sentence review: Human history is a function of geography. Detailed review to follow!!121!3 starsGuns, Germs, and Steel was recommended to me by my father. He asked me to read it and tell him what I thought of what Jared Diamond says. Generally speaking, this book outlines the different factors that contribute to a society succeeding and thriving, and how these factors have created the world we live in today. To answer my father, I said that I enjoyed it. It made me reflect a lot, it helped me form arguments in my IB ESS class, and in general gave me a nice insight into human history. Then, he said something that I will try to reflect on in this review: ""After reading this, do you think society could have formed any other way?""Before I get to answering that question, I'll go through a the things that I liked and didn't like about Diamond's work. This book was so unbelievably interesting. It's format made it very easy to follow along, and together it made perfect sense. This helped Diamond strengthen his theses. This organisation also makes this work very accessible, which for me (a person who wants to get more into non-fiction), was a great benefit! There are a bunch of diagrams, graphs, maps, and pictures in this book, which once again, made the reading experience more enjoyable; if you got bored, or got confused, there was sure to be an image soon to make you want to read again. The third thing that I really liked about this was the conversational narration that dominates the book. At times I felt like Mr. Diamond and I were having a conversation about the history of the world. When I switched over to the audiobook for some portions, this was accentuated even more. This style of narration ensured that you never felt like reading a history textbook, which was something I was scared of when entering this novel. The things that I didn't really like were how the chapters meandered sometimes or just went on and on about the same thing. I feel like 50 pages could be cut. Then again, I am just one person. Another person might find value in how Diamond proves his claims through various examples and scenarios. For me, it just got a bit repetitive and I didn't have the attention span for it. Other than that, when there was a tie-in to something discussed in a previous chapter, then said thing would be proven AGAIN through various examples in the context of whatever is the main topic in this new chapter. Again, someone might find this very interesting, personally it made me a bit tired. Ok, now to what I actually want to discuss: my father's question. After reading this book, I think that no, there is no other way society could have progressed. Maybe if we would have arisen originally on a different continent, we would be in a different place right now, but I don't know and that is what I find to be so interesting. In the prologue, Diamond sets up a thought experiment where you imagine yourself as travelling back into the past and watching the world starts all over again, but not intervening. I think that if this time-traveller version of me would be very very educated in the ways of history, importance of geography, language, etc. I would be able to predict fairly well where things will be. This makes me wonder if it is possible to predict where we will be in a thousand years or so... Kind of like how Hari Seldon does in Asimov's Foundation.In conclusion, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a good work of non-fiction. I liked how it made me reevaluate how I see the world around me. However, it did have some characteristics that I just didn't really click with. I recommend it, if you like history and are interested in why we are where we are now.!121!جرد دایموند دانشمند و نویسنده آمریکایی در کتاب اسلحه ، میکروب و فولاد با دانشی که بر جغرافیا دارد تلاش کرده است به سوال بسیار مهم علت پیشرفت برخی جوامع و مسلط شدن آنها بر دیگران پاسخ دهد ، دایموند برای شرح دادن دلایل خود به تاریخ پیدایش بشر از 13000 سال پیش پرداخته و به تدریج جلوتر آمده است . او برای پاسخ این سوال از علوم زیادی مانند  باستان شناسی ، زیست شناسی ، زبان شناسی ، ژنتیک ، تاریخ و جغرافیا استفاده کرده است و در پایان تفاوت امروزی بین جوامع و کشورهای مختلف را در  جغرافیا و خصوصیات محیط زیستی  آنها می داند . او در همین حال نظریه برتری نژادی ، اخلاقی ، فرهنگی را رد می کند .از نگاه آقای دایموند در قاره اوراسیا  تمدن و تکنولوژی از بقیه نقاط جهان سریعتر پیشرفت کرده است ،  هلال حاصلخیز ، شمال آفریقا و جنوب اروپا  نقاطی بوده اند که به دلیل جغرافیا ، سرسبزی ، تنوع گونه های جانوری و حاصلخیزی زمین و پرورش یافتن ، گندم ، جو و سایر غلات موفق به تولید غذا به اندازه نیاز و سپس مازاد شدند . آنها به این گونه از مرحله شکارچی گذاشتند ، حال آنکه در جوامع دیگر مانند جنوب آفریقا ، یا قاره آمریکا یا استرالیا یا گینه نو ، جوامع ابتدایی و از گونه شکارچی – گرد آورنده بودند . جوامع شکارچی که امروزه تعداد کمی از آنان در آفریقا پیدا می شوند به دلیل شرایط زندگی و جبر جغرافیا ، به دنبال گونه های گیاهی خاص و شکار حیوانات می رفته اند . به خاطر این نوع زندگی آنان ساکن منطقه ای خاص نشدند و بیشتر در جنگلها زندگی می کردند ، فاقد مسکن دایمی و همچنین ذخیره غذا بودند و جمعیت آنها به کندی و سختی رشد می کرد ، نیاز خاصی به پیشرفت تکنولوژی نداشتند و برای مثال نیزه و یا تیرکمان برای آنها کافی بود و از همه مهمتر به دلیل جمعیت وتراکم کم در برابر بیماری های یکجا نشینان به هیچ عنوان مصونیتی نداشتند .اما در مقابل در مناطق حاصلخیز ، با پیشرفت کشاورزی ، مازاد تولید به دست آمد و تولید اضافه به نوبه خود به افزایش باروری و رشد جمعیت منجر شد ، در گام بلندی دیگر ، انسان موفق  به اهلی کردن گونه های مختلفی از پستانداران  از جمله اسب ، گوسفند ، گاو ، خوک و سگ شد و بعدها با استفاد�� از اسب در امور نظامی برتری خرد کننده ای پیدا کرد ، همینگونه انسان با استفاده از نیروی عضلانی حیوانات موفق به زیر کشت بردن مساحت بیشتری اززمین شد . به تدریج عصر سفال گری و پیدایش ظرف به انسان یکجا نشین قدرت انبارش بیشتری داد و انسان را مجبور به ساکن شدن در دهکده ها کرد ، با افزایش جمعیت دهکده ها به چیزی تبدیل شدند که دایموند آنرا  خان سالاری  نامیده و در این دوران بوده که بشر موفق به کشف برنز شده . سپس دولت ها پدید آمدند ، نگارش رشد و پیشرفت کرد و آهن و عصر آهن آغاز شد .اما در میان  جوامع شکارچی  پیشرفت به کندی حاصل شده ، دایموند علت آنرا در مجموعه ای محدودتر از حیوانات و گیاهان وحشی مناسب اهلی شدن ، موانع بزرگتر بر سر راه گسترش فن آوری و وجود مناطق کوچکتر و منزوی تر از جمعیت های متراکم تر انسانی نسبت به اوراسیا می داند .بنابر این با پیدایش نگارش ، رشد شهر نشینی ، کشف آهن و استفاده گسترده از آن ، امکان ذخیره غذا ، استفاده از نقشه و پیشرفت در کشتیرانی ، این اروپایی ها بودند که آمریکا ، گینه نو ، آفریقا و استرالیا را مستعمره کردند نه بومیان آمریکا ، استرالیا یا گینه نو .مابقی داستان برای خواننده آشنا تر است ، کریستف کلمب  که اهل ایتالیا بوده با ناوگان اسپانیا دنیای نو ، قاره آمریکا را کشف می کند ، سپس  هرنان کورتس  با نیروی بسیار کوچک امپراتوری آزتک را در مکزیک کنونی شکست داده و البته میکروب ، ویروس و بیماری های شهرنشینان اروپایی تعداد بسیار بالایی تا (95%) جوامع بومی را که مصونیتی نسبت به این بیماری ها نداشتند را از بین می برد . اندکی بعد  فرانسیسکو پیزارو  با همان دلایل مشابه و با تعدادی بسیار کم امپراتوری اینکاها را شکست می دهد و شهر لیما پایتخت فعلی پرو را مقر حکومت خود می کند .می توان گفت اصل و ریشه کتاب اسلحه ، میکروب و فولاد همین است ،  مازاد تولید ، پیشرفت کشاورزی ، اهلی کردن حیوانات ، یکجا نشینی ، دهکده ها ، خان سالاری ، دولتها ، رشد و پیشرفت نگارش و کشف و استفاده از آهن ، در کنار پیشرفت در دریانوردی ، کشتیرانی و نقشه خوانی انسان در اوراسیا و خصوصا در اروپا  را در موقعیتی قرار داد که موفق به استعمار آمریکا ، استرالیا و آفریقا شد . در حقیقت کتاب در قرون وسطی باقی مانده و بعد از تسخیر آمریکا ، استدلال های آقای دایموند هم تمام شده و او دیگر هیچ حرف تازه ای ندارد . برای مثال دایموند توضیح نمی دهد که اسپانیا پس از رسیدن به اوج قدرت به خاطر چه دلایلی به کشوری کاملا ورشکسته تبدیل شد به گونه ای که تا ابتدای قرن گذشته جز فقیرترین کشورهای اروپا به شمار می رفته است . اما دلایل سقوط اسپانیا امروزه تقریبا کاملا روشن است و همانگونه که در کتاب  معمای فراوانی  شرح داده شده ، مجموعه ای از سیاستهای اشتباه اقتصادی و نه جبر جغرافیا بوده که اسپانیا را از پیشرفت باز داشت .امروزه می دانیم که مجموعه ای از دلایل و سیاستهای اقتصادی ، جغرافیای سیاسی ، طبیعت و محیط زیست و سیاستهای داخلی کشورها بوده که آینده آنها را رقم زده و جغرافیا هم یکی از آنها بوده است . جناب دایموند تنها عامل جغرافیا را در نظر گرفته و به راحتی دلایل دیگر را نادیده گرفته است . در حقیقت دایموند هم همانند  جیمز رابینسون و دارون عجم اوغلو  در کتاب  چرا ملتها شکست می خورند  تلاش کرده فرمولی یکسان برای تمام کشورها و ملت ها بیابد . دکتر زیباکلام  هم در دوگانه تحسین برانگیز  ما چگونه ما شدیم  و  غرب چگونه غرب شد  به شرح مجموعه دلایلی پرداخته که ایران را عقب نگه داشته و برخی از کشورها را بر دیگران برتری داده ، استدلال های او هم قابل درک و هم برای خواننده ای از خاورمیانه ملموس هستند . به همین ترتیب  دکتر کاظم علمداری  هم در کتاب  چرا ایران عقب ماند و غرب پیشرفت کرد  اگرچه نگاهی انتقادی و چالشی به کتب زیباکلام دارد اما در کنار آن نظریه های جدیدی هم طرح کرده است . کتاب دکتر دایموند اسلحه ، میکروب وفولاد اگرچه نگاهی جامع به دوران پیشا تاریخ ، عصر برنز و عصر آهن دارد اما متاسفانه با مقوله پیشرفت شگفت انگیز غرب در دو قرن گذشته و عقب ماندن شرق به همان میزان کار چندانی ندارد و در بهترین حالت در ابتدای قرن هجدهم مانده است .شاید بتوان مزیت کتاب اسلحه ، میکروب و فولاد را در زاویه دید متفاوت  آن دانست و به همین دلیل کتابی ایست متمایز که خواننده علاقه مند به مباحث توسعه را با نگاهی از نوع دیگر هرچند نه الزاما درست آشنا می کند .!121!This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read.!121!هذه ليست مراجعة كاملة، وإنما هي رد كتبته على قراءة الأخ خالد المغربي، وقد طلب الأخ الكريم بلطفه نقل الرد ليكون بمثابة مراجعة للكتاب، وها أنا أفعل رغم قناعتي أنه سيكون مراجعة عرجاء وناقصة كثيرا ً.قرأت هذا الكتاب العام الماضي، ولانشغالي حينها لم أكتب عنه للأسف، رغم قيمته الكبيرة وأهميته.يخبرنا مؤلف الكتاب جارد دايموند كيف جاءته فكرة الكتاب خلال محادثة له مع أحد سكان نيو غينيا الأصليين، الذي سأل دايموند لماذا لديكم أيها الغربيون الكثير من الشحنات – Cargos جمع شحنة، وهي الكلمة التي استخدمها الرجل ليعني بها لمَ لديكم كل هذه المخترعات؟ – وليس لدينا نحن مثلها، هذا السؤال لم يجب عليه دايموند حينها ولكنه شغله لسنوات طويلة تالية وكان هذا الكتاب الذي تحول أيضاً إلى فيلم وثائقي ممتع قدمه المؤلف نفسه.الجواب الذي قدمه دايموند يلخصه عنوان الكتاب (أسلحة، جراثيم وفولاذ)، حيث يخبرنا دايموند أولاً باللقاء الشهير بين كورتيز وموكتيزوما إمبراطور الأزتيك وكيف استطاع رجل وبضعة جنود القضاء على إمبراطورية كاملة، ويتخذ من هذه الحادثة التاريخية مدخلاً، ليشرح لمَ كان هناك فارق تقني هائل ما بين الغربيين والأزتيك، شارحا ً عوامل تطور الحضارات، من البيئة النباتية والحيوانية التي تنشأ فيها، وكيف تصنع هذه البيئة فروقات كبيرة على مدى طويل من أعمار الحضارات، وكيف أن تعايش الحضارات وتقاربها يمنحها الفرصة للاستفادة من بعضها، بينما عزلة بعضها يجعلها منكمشة، كما يشرح بعد ذلك أهمية ودور الأسلحة والحديد كأدوات للإنسان، ودور الجراثيم وكيف كان الأوربيون محصنين ضدها لأنهم كونوا مناعة، بينما قضت على السكان الأصليين بشكل مفجع، بحيث مات ملايين البشر بسبب أوبئة وأمراض جاءت مع الأوربيين.الكتاب متين ومهم جدا ً، وإن كان دايموند استفرغ جهده في شرح لمَ كانت حضارات العالم القديم متفوقة على حضارات العالم الجديد – أمريكا وأستراليا -، وأظن أنه يحتاج إلى عمر ثانٍ وكتاب ثانٍ ليشرح لما تفوق الأوربيون كحضارة على بقية حضارات العالم القديم، وهو ما عالجه في هذا الكتاب بشكل مقتضب وسريع.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Economics']"
Between the World and Me (Hardcover),Ta-Nehisi Coates,4.4,331204,2015,"“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.","Sometime early in my reading of this book, I felt in my gut I had encountered a classic. Not a best-seller—this book is already that—but a classic. I envisioned stack upon paperback stack piled on metal shelves in university bookstores, shelves labeled Black Studies 301 but also Basic Comp 100. I could see pirated copies of large portions of Part One passed out to high school juniors and seniors, to be carefully annotated in AP Language and AP Literature, and I could see smaller sections distributed (with the customary ""scaffolding"" materials) to freshmen and sophomores in Basic English I and II. But even now--after the winning of The National Book Award--I doubt my own vision. Coates book deserves to be a classic, just as much as The Life of Frederick Douglass, The Souls of Black Folk, The Fire Next Time, and The Autobiography of Malcolm X—all first-class books—deserve it. But a classic, after all, is not only a book of “first-class” quality, but one that is taught in “class”--and Coates book may be too bleak to appeal to educators--not to mention schoolboards and parents--who prefer books like To Kill a Mockingbird or The Secret Life of Bees that agree to temper (to dissipate?) their truth with the comforts of warmth.Coates book--presented as an open letter to his teenage son--is undoubtedly bleak. He grew up on the streets of Baltimore in the early '90's, and describes the experience in physical, visceral terms. As a black boy growing up in such streets, you knew that your body was continually under mortal threat, often under attack. At any moment your body could be controlled, violated, by the hands or weapons of another—often by the policemen employed by “the Dreamers,” those who define themselves as white in America and wish to preserve for themselves the privileges of the American Dream. And you knew that any of these random violations of the body could lead to the ending of your life. And if you were a young unbeliever—as Coates was and is—you were conscious that this act would end the only life you would ever know.Coates has no faith in America or in its dream. For him, unlike Martin Luther King, the arc of the moral universe bends not toward justice but chaos. The Dream itself is built upon the despoliation and violation of the bodies of black men and women, and may only end when it has finally violated and despoiled the entire planet:
Plunder has matured into habit and addiction; the people who could order the mechanized death of our ghettos, the mass rape of private prisons, then engineer their own forgetting, must inevitably plunder much more. This is not a belief in prophecy but in the seductiveness of cheap gasoline.Once, the Dream's parameters were caged by technology and by the limits of horsepower and wind. But the Dreamers have improved themselves, and the damming of seas for voltage, the extraction of coal, the transmuting of oil into food, have enabled an expansion in plunder with no known precedent. And the revolution has freed the Dreamers to plunder not just the bodies of humans but the body of the Earth itself.
 But this book is more than its bleakness; although it is never hopeful, it is earnest, honest, and aware. Coates describes his odyssey from the narrow streets of Baltimore, to the black “Mecca” of Howard University, to the diverse neighborhoods of NYC, and to his encounter with a profoundly different culture on the boulevards of Paris. He welcomes his increasingly wide world with open eyes (if not always open arms), and his encounters with it deepen—although they do not substantially alter—his perceptions of blackness or the toxic nature of the Dream. Finally, even his atheism seems to be something like a gift. Perhaps it is only by realizing that the body is ultimately all we have that we can finally get our priorities straight, stop believing in forms of “magic” like “salvation” or “the Dream” or ""progress,"" and instead concentrate on making sure that the bodies of all young people are protected and respected, so that each may discover the world with her own unique eyes.Between the World and Me is undoubtedly a great book. Even if its bleakness prevents it from becoming an official classic, there is still a part of my vision that I am sure will come true. I see fathers giving copies to their sons, mothers to their daughters, for generations to come.!121!I'm not sure what compelled me to pick up this book, but that's true of many books I read. I simply felt like it was something I needed to read at that moment, and I'm very glad I did.Between the World and Me is written as a letter/essay from Coates to his fifteen-year-old son, trying to come to terms with what it means to grow up as an African American male in 2015. I almost said ""make sense of what it means,"" but Coates' story is not so much about making sense as it is about finding one's place in a nonsensical context. He does not believe there is an answer to race relations. He believes (as I interpret it) that racial conflict is in itself an artificial construct and part of the Dream that keeps one group in power over another.This is not a book written to explain the African American experience to white people (or as Coates likes to say, people who believe they are white.) As a middle-aged white guy, I am in no way the intended audience for this book. Perhaps that's what made it such an enlightening read for me. There was no sugar-coating, no careful racial diplomacy, no worry about mediating opinions to cater to what white people might be able to hear. It was just a heartfelt, raw, painful and honest letter from a father to a son, laying plain Coates' worry, anger, frustration, and fear for his son's future in light of Coates' own past and the world his son will grow up in. (There again: I almost said 'the world he will inherit,' but Coates would be quick to point out that this is white thinking. We grow up believing we can inherit the future of our country, whereas African Americans grow up hearing a very different message.)Coates' most powerful assertion: doing violence to the African American body is an American legacy and tradition. It is not a failure of the system. It is part of the system. As much as may have changed in the past decades, the past centuries, the basic fear of African American parents remains: that their children can be snatched away, brutalized, killed for the smallest of reasons or no reason at all, and too often this violence is never addressed as anything more than an unavoidable force of nature like a hurricane.We all tend to gravitate toward books that reflect our own experience, toward characters who look and act the way we do. I believe many white readers, if they are honest with themselves, will think, If I'm a white person, why should I read a book about African Americans? That doesn't have anything to do with me. Whites have the privilege of not thinking about race until some violence flares up on the news, and then we think of the issue as a fire to put out, not a sign of some endemic problem. This was true when I was growing up in Texas in the 70s and 80s. It was true when I taught in San Francisco in the 90s. It's still true here in Boston in the 2010s. African Americans don't have the luxury of thinking about race only when it suits them. It is an omnipresent fact of life and death. It makes their experience of American society fundamentally different and exponentially more complicated. That's exactly why I'd recommend this book to white readers. Our bubble can be pretty thick. It is important for us to step outside ourselves.Coates offers no answers, easy or otherwise. He believes in no grand vision. But he offers his son an honest assessment of his own experience and his own evolving thoughts on America. That's what rang true to me: a father talking candidly and caringly with his son. That's common ground I share with the author, as different as our experiences may be. This is a short book, easily finished in a couple of sittings, but it packs a punch. These issues aren't going away. They are only going to become more pressing. Read the book!!121!Less than an hour ago (on 7/26/2015) I finished reading Ta-Nehisi Coates’ book, Between the World and Me. As I read the last sentence, “Through the windshield I saw the rain coming down in sheets,” I was involuntarily overcome with inexplicable, yet wholly warranted emotion. Oddly, tears, my tears, tears perhaps I had been locking inside my fatherly bravado for a couple decades, came down in their own sheets, as thoughts of my child, my daughter, at fourteen years old, still having to face the daemonic vulgarities of a world she had no part in building but would be expected to repair, came to life. The tears came because Coates, in a few pages, captured, exposed, unlocked and translated what so many people of color, so many frustrated and frightened parents, and so many disenfranchised and nomadic youth found so difficult to dictate and explain. For them, the feelings were there but the words simply would not come. I wept because Coates' story was my story from my early experiences as a student at Morehouse College (the Harvard of the South) to the wanderer (and discoverer) of beauty upon the Parisian landscape, to accepting my unexpected role as an English teacher in a tough and directionless Baltimore City, to my exploration and rebirth, producing who I am today.Like so many, I was immediately taken to the oft quoted, extensively analyzed and eternally relevant essay, The Fire Next Time, written in 1962 by James Baldwin, as a “letter” to his nephew, written I suppose, for all the nephews in the world to analyze and digest. The similarities between Coates and Baldwin were uncanny, and certainly intentional, as ""Between the World... was written by Coates to his son, as if a continuation to Baldwin’s last line from “The Fire…”: “And everywhere there is the anguish of being black in a society that at times seems poised on the brink of total racial war.” Yes, Coates released Between the World and Me, several weeks after the ‘unrest’ in Baltimore at the urging of his publisher, a timely and strategically perfect act and as an expose of tumultuous racial injustice and social chaos headlining the evening news the world over. He writes: “But race is the child of racism, not the father.” Indeed. Perhaps.This is a book that must be read and passed on to the youth to read several times over; a book for universities and secondary schools to add to their bulging curriculum to produce and encourage meaningful dialogue without blame or bias. Between the World and Me, is a book that should be discussed over scones and tea and bags of potato chips, and shared during drives to grandma’s house in the country or the inner city. It should be read by all people regardless of color, creed, nationality or social belief. This is a book of substance and timeless relevance. It is the book we all know. Eagerly and with great expectation, I await the next Coates to continue the story between the world and us.!121!I'll get all of my disclaimers out of the way first. I am a fan of TNC but I also resent what he symbolizes. He is a great writer in his own right and he has the kind of co-signers in publishing and journalism that have offered him a platform that he has rightfully and eloquently expanded upon, utilized and maximized appropriately and used to catapult himself into the American race dialogue as one of the most prolific writers on race during our generation. My resentment of what he symbolizes comes from the absence of the same position and opportunity being afforded any Black American woman writer in our time. Essentially, my beef with TNC is not really beef with him at all as much as it is beef with the notion that a singular, vetted Black male voice has always been and continues to be viewed by non-Black readers, editors and consumers of racial rhetoric as the only voice that matters when it comes to writing eloquently about race and politics and intersectionality. All of that said, Between the World and Me has some great ideas and lines. The critique that black women are invisible or marginalized in the book is a faulty one; there is Mabel Jones, whose powerful testimony and grieving for her son closes the book and codifies the only perspective from which TNC would be able to include a black woman's voice - as mother, wife. There are the women he has loved at The Mecca, including his wife. There are authors that he includes in his wheelhouse of important influencers, Lucille Clifton, bell hooks and Toni Morrison. Speaking of Toni, I do not agree that this book is required reading generally. I get the comparisons to Baldwin but I am aggravated by them -- mainly because there is only one Baldwin. And Black writers need to be able to make their own legacies without immediate comparisons that perpetuate the limited imagination that America has for us...along with the continual reality that there can only ever be one valid, praised Black writer at a time. That said, I believe the central idea and argument -- that black bodies are not safe and that protection of them is not a requirement of realizing the American Dream -- will be a revelation for non-Black readers and a healing affirmation for Black readers who have until now not had their experience considered or regarded as anything other than a figment of their imagination or proof of their nihilism or some other sinister sentiment.!121!Listen to the audio book if you can!!121!Between the World and Me is a non-fiction story which is a letter from a black man to his son, Samori.This book accomplishes what a news article cannot—it describes the feelings of being a black person in America, what it feels like to know that the police are not your friend, that they aren’t there to protect you, that they symbolize danger. When a black person is killed, people read about it in an article and move about their day, they don’t feel the weight of it, they don’t feel the true cost: all of the hours taking that child to football, private music lessons, spending hours together tutoring, that the deceased had a bright future. Ta-Nehisi Coates also talks about The Dream. This is the standard that is idealized in the United States of America. Society celebrates those that conform to the social norms of a straight, white Christian man. Anyone who does not conform to these norms is not safe. He raises a good point. Would Barack Obama have been elected if he had dreads? What if he didn’t look like a black version of Iron Man? He is literally playing basketball in a button-up dress shirt! Why can’t society accept people for who they are? One character in the book stated, “By then I was the chief of radiology at the local hospital. And so they treated me with respect.” Why does someone have to be the chief of radiology before being given respect? For additional reading on this subject, I would highly recommend White Feminism by Koa Beck and You Don’t Know Us Negroes and Other Essays by Zora Neale Hurston. 2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta!121!Folks that love Mr. Coates will love this book, as they'll be able to follow him through a piece that is somewhat indulgent -- but he certainly won't win new fans or quell his skeptics (like myself) with this piece of work. Coates says that he wanted to write like Baldwin, but it just comes across as a unfocused, stream of consciousness. As a black man who constantly battles with the work of Mr. Coates, I wanted to give this one a chance, as many lament tons of praise on the work -- but I for one still think that our perceptions of what it means to be a black man in America today are far different--my own not being one of privilege, but one that gives me much more hope than what Mr. Coates likes to deal out to his readers.!121!I've read Coates work in the Atlantic for years now and my fundamental impression of him is unchanged. His limited Black liberal anti-racist appeals to White guilt illustrate his total inability to escape the narrow racial essentialist vision of Black identity. Coates in his book reduces America to basically two categories: The Dreamers, (White Americans) and the rest being Black folk. This thinking demonstrates such a pedestrian understanding of America, especially when considering that the ""Empire,"" as Coates once correctly refers to this nation, is headed by a Black president, Attorney General, and Director of Homeland Security. Coates has no explanation for how the ""black bodies"" he often laments, are being crushed by law enforcement mechanisms which are under the legal purview of a Black Woman. His total lack of effective class analysis further demonstrates that Coates has not evolved past a Martin vs. Malcolm understanding of Black America. Coates' inability to explain American oppression outside of mere anti-black racism is also troubling in its banality. No critique of capitalism that explains why it needs racism and a complete lack of materialist analysis outside the totally unoriginal rhetoric of ""America was built on our backs."" Coates' myopic race speak drivel offers no remedy or policy, simple grievance and complaint. In that way his voice is perfect for our neoliberal age which so perfectly uses identity politics cries for representation in the ""upper management"" cue to maintain the Empire. There are neither original arguments or thoughts in this book. Simply grievance based cries for white attention.!121!I thought it was a little fishy that all the reviews on here are these reverent whispery multi-starred nods of agreement about how important this book is. I mean, that just never happens, especially with the ""it"" book of the moment : there are always naysayers and contrarians and people who just don't get what the BFD is. Since there's a copy lying around my house, I thought I'd check it out -- the season's ""it"" book is rarely just 152 pages and about a topic that interests me, so I was excited to participate in the cool thing for once, after missing out on Fifty Shades of Grey and The Hunger Games and Eat Pray Love and all the rest due to a combination of laziness and snobbery.On some level I was hoping to be the don't-believe-the-hype hater on here, but Coates left me disappointed on that front. It did take me a little while to get into this but once he got to college I was hooked and couldn't stop even though it was late and I had to get up at 3am to catch a transcontinental flight. My main question before I read it was, ""What new is there to say?"" I'd noticed everyone had their panties all in a twist over this book about being black in America and based on what I'd heard I just didn't get what he could've said that seemed so revelatory and new.The answer is, not too much really: it's more the way that he says it. Between the World and Me is an intensely personal book that's rooted in deeply-felt lived experience. As someone who is horrified by our era's obsession with memoir, I am occasionally floored when I see what a personal story can do. I recently read an essay online by a woman whose father had committed suicide that made me seriously rethink my antipathy towards memoir, and my response to this book was similar. So often the recounting of personal experience and private feelings comes off as dull, narcissistic, and unnecessary, but on occasion memoir transcends itself and is able to speak to something much larger than one person's life with an authority that nothing else can.It doesn't need to be said but I'll point out anyway that a lot of this book's success has to do with timing. White Americans have been able to ignore a lot of this for a long time, but recently that's become almost impossible to do. In the past two weeks we've heard Sandra Bland's traffic stop and watched Samuel DuBose be murdered before our eyes and the trauma of witnessing these things, and the rest from the past year, has left pretty much everyone looking for answers.This book did partially answer a huge question I've had for years that I'm sure a lot of other uninformed white people have but that's too offensive and embarrassing to ask black parents directly, which is, ""What do you tell your kids? When do you tell them? And how do you reassure them that it's going to be alright, when as a parent you're supposed to help them feel things will be okay but you're also supposed to be honest and keep them safe?"" This book is constructed as a letter to Coates's fifteen-year-old son, and the reason it's so satisfying is that it does not err on the side of false comfort and remains honestly bleak. It also gave me the uncomfortably excited feeling of access to a perspective I've always wanted to know more about but was -- yeah, I'll admit it -- afraid to ask.I think pretty often about what makes me an adult, and maybe this sounds weird but one of the main things is understanding now what a big deal it is when people die. I feel like when I was a kid I didn't quite get that that actually happened, and then when I was a teenager I didn't think it was very serious, but when I grew up I finally saw that this was it, this was huge, this was almost the only thing that there was that mattered. Between the World and Me's main orientation is corporal: it's concerned with what happens to a person's body as ultimately the sole important thing. For me, this is a helpful way to think about racism. I remember one day when I was not so old, but not really that young either, reading that African American men have much shorter life expectancies than white American men due to health disparities, and it was like a light went off and I finally saw what racism was in a different and much truer way than I had before. So much discourse about race takes place in these abstract terms that speak about social construction and are preoccupied with the nuance of language and ideas, but there is something about a return to the body that blows that away. At the end of the day, redlining matters because it's created conditions in which black kids are more likely than white kids to get hit with a stray bullet while walking to school. It sounds foolishly obvious but police brutality and mass incarceration affect people in the most stark and concrete way: by ending lives, by physically hurting or locking up their bodies. Of course there are other reasons why racism is is a problem, but Coates's emphasis on the body, and his insistence that nothing else matters so much beyond that, resonated with me.This is a book that takes our country's sweet language about having a dream and turns it into a bitter mouthful of ashes. I'm actually surprised it's so popular because I feel we as Americans crave optimism and promises of solutions, and Coates offers neither. There's a lot of beauty in the world, he says, and there are great things about being young, gifted and black or whatever, but he doesn't believe in any moral arc of the universe tilting toward justice or in any of this getting especially better, which according to him (spoiler alert!) will be a moot point anyway soon because we'll all be underwater.A short, well-written, timely book that I, along with everyone else, recommend.!121!I received this book free for review from ShelfAwareness in exchange for an honest review. Despite the privilege of receiving a free book, I’m absolutely candid about it below because I believe authors and readers will benefit most from honest reviews rather than vacuous 5-star reviews.Written in the form of a letter from a father to a son, ""Between the World and Me"" is a detailed crystallization of the state of racism in our country today and its historical roots throughout the entire history of our country. My normal review format is to prattle on about positive and negative aspects of a book but in this case I think it's really more important to the potential reader that they understand what exactly it is that they're getting.For those who want a light breezy primer on racism... this is not it. This is profound and erudite and is the sort of book you could pick apart sentence by sentence for a year and at the end of that year just shake your head in despair. What Coates has done, like I've never seen before, is passionately and profoundly lay out the sad state of race relations in this country. The book reads like a PhD thesis as it patiently and methodically makes its points and then proves them.The book is also infinitely quotable. I read a few passages aloud to my fiancee and her wide-eyed reaction was to simply mouth the word ""wow"". Coates strings words together in a most elegant tapestry that forces the reader to think carefully and internalize the grim realities of life as a victim of racism in this country. Read so that ye may weep and know the truth.PS: I hope my review was helpful. If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that you’d want to know. I always aim to improve. -- Rob SlavenFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tatteredthread/Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile...YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/RobSlave...WordPress: https://tthread.wordpress.com/!121!""But all our phrasing- race relations, racial chasms, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy- serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth."" - Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me A couple of days ago I posted on Twitter a painting by Jean-Léon Gérôme entitled 
""Truth Coming Out of Her Well to Shame Mankind.""
 I love the painting, the title, and I think that's how truth can appear to some people; scary but perhaps appealing as well. On a similar note, I love the honest, truthful accounts people are writing about their lives these days. I've often spoken of the gratitude I feel in particular to the different black writers who have given their unique perspectives that have helped paint a bigger picture about what it means to be black in the West. Although most literature is focused on the USA, so many of us who don't live there understand to a certain extent the experiences.[image error]"" />Jean-Léon Gérôme- ""Truth Coming Out of Her Well to Shame Mankind."" So I read this eloquent and detailed response to the world, a letter to Ta-Nehisi Coate's teenage son, and I'm glad I did. The comparisons to Baldwin are very apt, especially having read ""The Fire Next Time."" Baldwin's book, one of my favourite pieces of writing, is still very applicable to our time, and Coates' has been written specifically for our time with several modern references. I recognized many familiar names; Trayvon Martin, Rekia Boyd, and Michael Brown, and others.This is less of a book review than a response to what emotions and thoughts the book brought out in me, so it might sound a bit disjointed. I can't even begin to imagine the pain and difficulty many black people face when raising their children in a hostile world, a world that does very little to treat black people as worthy. Several of the adults in my family had the ""race talk"" with me. From a young age I knew how I was likely to be perceived, and I was taught ways that I could lessen the impact, and I realized as I got older how exhausting it is to live like this, very often on guard.The adults in my family and community did their best to create a safe environment for the kids despite society's obviously powerful presence. And I don't know if all the repercussions of living in such a world were completely evident to them because perhaps they expected racism and hardships for several reasons, but for someone like me who was raised in the West, my thoughts have always been ""I am practically one of you, your society socialized me, why do I still feel this feeling of unbelonging?""The last few years have been very trying and we're dealing with a lot of backlash from discourses about race and what to do about racism. This book helps to show there is no way to forget our skin colour because we are treated based on what we look like, not on who we are. I often see the onus is on marginalized people to change their ways of reacting to racism, and when I read this book I am more aware of how pervasive racism is in all parts of society, and the effects it has on minorities living in these societies.""We were black, beyond the visible spectrum, beyond civilization. Our history was inferior because we were inferior, which is to say our bodies were inferior. And our inferior bodies could not possibly be accorded the same respect as those that built the West."" I appreciate Coates' discussion of education as he saw it and experienced it. I think it's very telling and clearly shows that the role of the schools was to uphold white supremacy. I can speak from experience that as a black person learning in history class that the main contributions your ancestors have contributed have been slavery, is disheartening, yet I felt grateful that my history was even touched on. It took me well into my 20s, and on my own accord, to study black history that didn't focus on slavery. And the effects of that were obviously huge, and made me realize that my people had contributed so much more than is readily admitted.When I read the story of Coate's friend who was shot and killed by police, I found his reminiscences of his friend very poignant, and adding more depth to what it means for a black person to be killed for no reason but the colour of their skin:""Think of all the love poured into him...And think of how that vessel was taken, shattered on the concrete, and all the holy contents, all that had gone into him, sent flying back to the earth.""This book is full of profound quotes and thoughts that I'm still thinking about weeks later:  ""It struck me that perhaps the defining feature of being drafted into the black race was the inescapable robbery of time, because the moment we spent readying the mask, or readying ourselves to accept half as much, could not be recovered.""I could really go on and on about this book because there is so much to say. I'm very thankful I was able to read it.!121!I opened this book expecting to find a reasoned analysis of the situation in which many black Americans find themselves today, along with a reasonable set of recommended solutions to their problems. That is not what I found at all. I read the book because I saw and heard Mr. Coates on several TV news and talk shows, and I thought he might have something of value to contribute to the national discussion. I was wrong. Mr. Coates is a very angry man. His ideas have been shaped by other angry men. He is every bit as warped as the most virulent of white supremacists. The only difference is that he is bent in a different direction. This book is nothing more than a hate-filled diatribe that seeks to blame white America for all of the problems that can currently be found within the black culture and community in the United States. In the book, the author portrays a white America that is totally removed from reality. He describes brooks running through the back yards of white children, and white boys pushing their toy trucks through the trees adjoining those brooks. I don’t know how to tell him this, but there is a great deal of white America that comes nowhere near this idyllic dream of how white Americans live. This world exists only in the sick mind of Mr. Coates.Coates apparently used the shooting death of Michael Brown as the inspiration to write this book. He constantly harks back to this event throughout the book, making allegations and implications that are without merit. Never mind that Michael Brown has been proven to have been a criminal and a thug who committed a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store, walked down the middle of a street intended for motor vehicles (which is probably against the law in every city in America), refused to obey a lawful order from a police officer, physically fought with that officer through the open window of a police cruiser, attempted to seize the officer’s firearm, caused the firearm to discharge at least twice while it was still inside the vehicle, and then turned and charged the officer when that officer attempted to detain and arrest him. Coates takes none of these facts into consideration in his hateful screed, insisting, instead, that the shooting death of Michael Brown was unjustified. He ignores the fact that a lot of people who have read the transcript of the Grand Jury hearings believe otherwise, as did the Grand Jury, itself. Mr. Coates emphasizes the fact that the body of Michael Brown remained in the street for more than four hours, and that the police did nothing to remove it. He ignores the fact that, under Missouri Law, nobody but a Coroner, Medical Examiner or a member of that person’s staff is allowed to move or remove a body when a crime might be involved. This is also true of many other jurisdictions, and Coates could have learned this had he made any attempt to do so. It took a significant amount of time to complete the crime scene investigations, and for the Medical Examiner’s staff to remove the body, and this is often the case in smaller jurisdictions that must rely on a Coroner or ME from a different jurisdiction. It is unfortunate that the system works this way, but it does. Mr. Coates would do well to spend less time whining and more time learning about how his governments work at all levels. The color of the skin of the victim makes absolutely no difference to the operation of a Coroner or Medical Examiner’s office. With limited resources, they do their jobs the best they can, and if it had been a white person who had been killed, the body would probably have remained at the scene for the same amount of time. The author goes on to blame the school system where he attended school for many of the problems that he faced later in his life. He believes that the courses and curriculum offered by schools should be tailored specifically for black people who, presumably, share his philosophies. This, rather than to impart the knowledge that history has shown us that humans need in order to succeed and thrive. How selfish and self-centered is that? Never mind that white kids probably sat in the same classrooms and studied the same course work taught by the same teachers as Coates, but probably did not feel that they were cheated out of an education. Mr. Coates projects his own hatreds, his own anger, his own fears onto all black people. What gives him this right – the right to speak for all African-Americans? He says it! On page #29 he says: “all black people.” He’s just wrong. There are many black people who did not grow up with the hate, the anger, and the fear that Coates describes. President Barack Obama comes to mind. As does General Colin Powell, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and many, many more. Many of the conclusions reached by the author and related in the book are based on false assumptions. On one page, for example, Coates talks about the first black “five star general.” To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a black five star general because there have been only five five-star generals in US history: Eisenhower, MacArthur, Bradley, Arnold, and Marshall. I don’t believe that any of them was black. The rank of five-star general was created in 1944. Generals who carried the title of “General of the Army” wore only four stars before 1944. In addition, four US Navy Admirals were granted the rank of five stars during WWII. None of them was black. There are no five-star generals of any skin color serving today because it is a temporary rank that is only granted during wartime. Coates has not done the research expected and required for such a serious book.On page #83 of the book, the author acknowledges that the member of the Prince George’s Police Deportment who shot and killed his friend Prince Jones “was black,” saying: “The officer who killed Prince Jones was black. The politicians who empowered this officer to kill were black. Many of the black politicians, many of them twice as good, seemed unconcerned. How could this be?” Even though he says this, he is able to blame white America for the death, and for all problems in the black community. It makes absolutely no sense, and I do not understand his reasoning at all. Coates then goes on to make a point of claiming that no criminal charges were ever filed against the officer who killed his friend, and that is true. Coates fails to mention, however, that a civil damages suit against the officer and the county was successful, and Prince Jones’ daughter will receives a total of $4.6 million in damages to be paid in regular installments until she reaches the age of 40. The Prince George’s County undercover narcotics corporal was found to be civilly responsible for Jones’ wrongful death. On page #86 of his book, Coates revealingly tells us that: “I would never consider any American citizen pure.” He says it in the context of blaming all of America for the death of his friend Prince Jones. He apparently reaches this conclusion while standing on the roof of his apartment watching the plumes of smoke rising from the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001. I found his words to be a startling revelation of the amount of hatred in his heart. On the very next page, Coates goes on to tell us that: “I could see no difference between the officer who killed Prince Jones and the police who died, or the firefighters who died.” How warped and twisted is it to compare American heroes to somebody who was, in all likelihood, a cold-blooded murderer? The author describes walking through his neighborhoods in Flatbush, in Harlem, in Baltimore, and having to deal with the “same boys with the same bop, the same ice grill, and the same code” that he had known all his life. Even though all of these boys that he refers to are black, he still blames all of his problems on the white race. Coates has apparently concluded that all evils perpetrated against black people, or white people, is done so by other white people. This idea is so patently absurd and false that it is beyond reason. In Africa, for example, there are terrorist groups that commit terrible acts of violence and evil against the population, and against anybody else that they can find, including innocent white shoppers at a mall in Kenya. These groups are predominantly black. Boko Haram is just one example of such a group. al-Shabaab is another. Coates probably has never heard of them because he is so narrowly-focused.The author’s thoughts and narrative ignore the fact that non-whites and non-blacks routinely perpetrate vicious acts of violence and evil against other members of the same race. North Korea is an example. Perhaps Coates has never heard of North Korea. Maybe he knows nothing at all about the Taliban, or al-Qaeda. Or, in spite of his referral to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he knows nothing at all about the Gulag and its forced labor camps in Siberia. Does he believe that the inmates who are held there in slavery are all black? The author repeatedly refers to the myth of Trayvon Martin. He compares Martin to Prince Jones. Actually, there is no comparison, and if Coates had bothered to watch the George Zimmerman trial, or if he had bothered to read the trial transcripts, he, too, could know the truth about Trayvon Martin. The two incidents were totally different with absolutely no relationship to each other. It seems like whenever something bad happens to a black man, Coates universally blames it on white racism. Trayvon Martin was killed by a Hispanic man who was trying to defend himself from a brutal assault. What does that have to do with the white race? What does it have to do with the police? What does it have to do with the death of Prince Jones, who might very well have been murdered. The author seems to be keenly aware of the black experience in two large Eastern American cities: Baltimore and New York. He also seems to be very familiar with the history of black slavery in the Southern United States up to and through the Civil War. However, he seems to be totally unaware of the human experience in other parts of the world, including the Far East, the Middle East, Europe and many other places. His perspective is, therefore, very, very narrow. On pages #108 and #109 Coates describes the heart-rending eviction of a black family from its home in Chicago. He tries to convey the sense that only black people ever get evicted from their homes. The very first real eviction that I ever saw or heard of was when I watched one of my neighbors, a white man, be evicted from his longtime family home. Several of my neighbors lost their homes and were evicted after the Great Recession of 2008. None of them was black. Evictions take place every day somewhere in the United States. Not all of those being evicted are black, contrary to the author’s attempt to convince us otherwise. I feel pity for Coates, but I feel even more pity for his son, who is doomed to grow up in a household dominated by two emotions: hatred and anger. On pages #111 through #113 the author, as is his way, relates an incomplete, twisted, and inaccurate portrayal of the shooting death of Jordan Davis in Jacksonville, Florida. Coates says: “. . . the killer was convicted not of the boy’s murder but of firing repeatedly as the boy’s friends attempted to retreat.” He then continued: “Destroying the black body was permissible – but it would be better to do it efficiently.” The truth of the matter is that the killer, a man named Michael David Dunn, was actually convicted of one count of first degree murder, three counts of attempted second degree murder, and one count of shooting into a car. He has been sentenced to a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The killer did not escape justice. It appears, then, that destroying a black body is not permissible at all. How many of you who have, or will, read this book would know that Coates is being dishonest on this matter? It is clear that he sees everything through the prism of race. Coates certainly could have done what I, and probably many others, did and downloaded the trial and grand jury hearing transcripts so that he could learn the truth. He didn’t. Coates could have heard the same sworn testimony that the jury heard in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin trial, but he didn’t. He prefers to wallow in his hatred and his anger, perpetuating lies and distortions because they fit with his sick, twisted world view. Then, he compares a proven thug, strong-arm robber of convenience stores, and assaulter of a police officer to his own son? How sick is that? Is he raising a thug and a criminal? Unless you have a high tolerance for sick, twisted propaganda, you should probably skip this book. It is a hate-filled screed that is not worthy of attention from reasonable, sane readers.!121!I was both very impressed and frustrated with Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Between the World and Me. Written as a letter to his son, Coates presents racism and white privilege as a visceral experience, with much discussion, especially early in the book about what it means to lose your (black) body. I’m not going to explain what Coates means by losing your body; you should read how he frames this in the context of both American history and his own experience. While I intend to re-read the first half of the book, the second half feels repetitious. Even though I am convinced that the U.S. still has unresolved structural and institutional problems which allow the continuation of racism and oppression, I don’t feel that Coates offers either a solution or any call to action. If, as Coates points out numerous times, it’s not enough for individuals to recognize how racism operates in this country (and thus act in ways which aren’t prejudiced), what’s the answer? If individuals can’t be a force for change, is it even helpful to recognize white privilege in the first place? 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars because (while I may fairly or unfairly want more) I do feel this is a powerful work that should be read.!121!Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me is an essay to his teenaged son. Toni Morrison on the cover maintains that this should be required reading. In this short yet powerful message, Coates delivers a rap on race and offers hope to African Americans in their struggle to maintain their culture. Coates is a respected journalist and essayist and here writes a lyrical prose that had me captivated from the first pages. His message is simple- African Americans have to work twice as hard because of their bodies and the never ending struggle to prevail in a culture where the color of their skin works against them. It does not matter if one has been brought up in the projects, suburbia, or wealthy, gated communities- the struggle is the same. There will always be an undercurrent of fear just below the surface of a bringing a black child into the world and raising him/her free of violence, free of the brutality of an unjust system. There will always be pressure to be a Dreamer to get out and Coates warns people of acting white. He interviews Dr. Mabel Jones, respected radiologist and mother of his murdered classmate Prince Jones. The daughter of sharecroppers, Dr. Jones was determined to make a better life for herself, to the point of integrating a high school and later as an adult sending her children to private schools. Yet despite her dream of her son attending Harvard, he chose Howard, the Mecca for black students who need a space to be themselves, to flaunt their rap and hip hop and African culture. And yet despite this upbringing, her son was still murdered for being black. The advice she gives to Coates, which he pens poignantly, is to still be oneself, to not be afraid to wear a hoodie and to play rap music. To act white is to give into the authority which has already denied the culture for the last 240 years. Between the World and Me is an eye opening experience to me. I had just read In the Heat of the Night where colored officer Virgil Tibbs is denied respect simply for being black. After reading it, I think that we have come a long way as a nation in the past 50 years. Then, I read Coates essay where he bluntly states that as a parent of a black child, he is fearful for him to go out into the world. Have we advanced in 50 years? Coates published this piece in the aftermath of the Michael Brown killing, spurning race riots in Baltimore. The riots got so bad that the city had to be on lockdown, even forcing a baseball game to be played in an empty stadium. This seems to be one step forward, two steps back, and Coates' essay has been distributed at a key moment in our nation's history. I agree with Toni Morrison that Between the World and Me should be required reading in schools. It could turn out to be the definitive discourse on race for this generation and an important read for students before they enter the world at large. It should only take a few hours to read, maybe a little longer for students, and generates important discussions in and out of the classroom. The United States is a melting pot of cultures and no one should have to renounce their culture due to the color of their skin. A poignant read that I rate 5 stars, I highly recommend Between the World and Me to all.!121!Freedom, opportunity and education are all part of being equal citizens in the first world. But these are things of the mind. If you can't even keep the body safe, then what use are intellectual pursuits and a law guaranteeing you rights? And in seems in America that Black people find it very hard to keep their bodies safe.Who goes to prison more for drugs? Black people, although White people commit more drug offences being as they form the bulk of the population. Why is crack cocaine punished more harshly than cocaine use? Is it because one is a drug of the ghetto and the other of corporate executives? Why is death row filled with more Black people than White when more crimes in general, murder included are by Whites because of their numbers? Why are cops trigger-happy when they see Black people, perhaps especially young men? What does it do to the psyche of Black people when they daily face having to protect their body from harm or death? Even children on the way to school. What did they ever do? You would think that people remembering why Blacks are in the US at all would have a totally different attitude.I have two Black sons. One of them is tall, handsome and loud. He has his own business and always drives very slowly so he can hail everyone he knows. He has beautifully-groomed dreadlocks but is not a rasta, he doesn't do any kind of drugs, he's strictly a Heineken man. I have always dissuaded him from going to the US, go anywhere but there. American cops don't like big Black guys with loud voices and long locks. Go anywhere but the US.The other is wooden boat builder. He in conjunction with the college builds and repairs the traditional wooden boats of the island. His grandfather and family were famous boat builders of three-masted schooners. He also races boats at the highest level, helming for CEOs of banks and visiting diplomats in competitions. He has braids, and sometimes earrings, and likes US ghetto-style clothes complete with gang-style head wrap occasionally (time he grew out of it but still....).Since he is used to giving orders on racing boats for MDs etc and expects them to be followed, he doesn't really have any idea of the respect Blacks are supposed to pay White authority figures in the US as Ta-Nehisi Coates prescribes. He's milder-mannered than his brother, not so loud, always laughing but he can argue, that boy can really argue. I try and dissuade him too from going to the US. I tell him to travel the world but don't go there... I am frightened for my sons, they risk prison at the least with their attitudes, I think a lot of West Indians from professional families have them. I do wonder how they do in the US compared to African-Americans. Coates travelled in Europe and didn't find the institutionalised racism that permeates the US. Racism is there undoubtedly, but it isn't built into every old building that slave labour put up, or every farm that was a plantation, or every school that was once segregated because there was never slavery in Europe. but as Coates writes to his son, this book, this letter, take care of yourself in the US because, frankly, they are out to get to you. The link between then - going after escaped slaves who won't stay in their place and do as they are told and treat the White man with respect. Punish them, make an example of them, and so what if they die in the process? - and now seems to be a very short one. But for some of us, for the author, for my family, we are ""them""._____Notes on reading the book.  I will be interested to see how much this applies to Blacks in general as I live on an island where the Black man is king, but he only got there because of slavery. Quite a few of the kids go away to university in the US, to 'historically black' colleges and come back full of the most disgusting kind of crap and attitude and forgetting they reign here.Some years ago I had a Saturday girl and she was so fantastic that on her last day, I was off island and told her to lock up and put the keys under the door but when I got back at 7.30 pm she was still there. I asked her why and she said that she wanted to leave the shelves perfectly organised for the next person. When she came back from the US she grew locks and joined with a group of people who call themselves by African names and are always going on about race. My family were in Russia until the 1920s but my skin colour condemns me to them, guilty of slavery as far as she and they are concerned.A guy I know, a Black Muslim, very friendly (although his father is an anti-Semite and tries to get people to buy Texe Marrs books). He used to come and buy books, poetry and philosophy and chat. He went away to the US and when he came back he came to invite me to a poetry reading in the local poetry and drama club. He said that what he had to say was embarrassing but if any of the poems were anti-White, they weren't directed at me. I didn't go.So, yes, I will be interested to see how the Black American views his land and how it has influenced the Caribbean kids who study there.!121!Hmm. A lot to think about here. Stay tuned.!121!Posted at Heradas5/27/20 update: Obviously people still need to read this book, because this shit keeps happening. Already read it? Buy another copy and give it to a friend.A deeply illuminating, honest look at the realities of being black in America, written as a letter to the author's teenage son. It doesn't insult by offering a solution to the problems, but aims only to make the reader acknowledge the deeply internalized, institutionalized racism, hate, and fear that built America and the American Dream. Read it.“The forgetting is habit, is yet another necessary component of the Dream. They have forgotten the scale of theft that enriched them in slavery; the terror that allowed them, for a century, to pilfer the vote; the segregationist policy that gave them their suburbs. They have forgotten, because to remember would tumble them out of the beautiful Dream and force them to live down here with us, down here in the world. I am convinced that the Dreamers, at least the Dreamers of today, would rather live white than live free.”""..a society that protects some people through a safety net of schools, government-backed home loans, and ancestral wealth but can only protect you with the club of criminal justice has either failed at enforcing its good intentions or has succeeded at something much darker.""""The pursuit of knowing was freedom to me, the right to declare your own curiosities and follow them through all manner of books. I was made for the library, not the classroom. The classroom was a jail of other people’s interests. The library was open, unending, free. Slowly, I was discovering myself.""""I am black, and have been plundered and have lost my body. But perhaps I too had the capacity for plunder, maybe I would take another human’s body to confirm myself in a community. Perhaps I already had. Hate gives identity. The nigger, the fag, the bitch illuminate the border, illuminate what we ostensibly are not, illuminate the Dream of being white, of being a Man. We name the hated strangers and are thus confirmed in the tribe. But my tribe was shattering and reforming around me.""!121!#BlackLivesMatterLet me start off by saying that Toni Morrison has said, this book is required reading. So get yourself a copy! It's necessary reading for the current climate that we are in that is only portraying a single, skewed narrative and on the same side of that coin damaging and manipulating a narrative that needs to be heard. As you may know, this book speaks about race in America, starting from the days of slavery till now, to provide us with this viewpoint that makes the reader understand ‘what it is like to inhabit a black body.’It's almost like a personal diary from Coates to his son explaining how it is we have come to the state we are in, and to offer consolation to his son through it. This is such a beautifully written book. I love that the author was able to write with such clarity that enabled the reader to really be put in a black person's shoes. To understand their culture and to comprehend that the root cause of it all is fear; that is what is driving these people forward as it is their only means of survival. Crippling fear where your guard is up 24/8 because you know that as soon as you step out into that world you have a target set and ready on your back, translating into a harshness within an individual that at its essence is fear. And Coates lets the reader (and his son) view this fear through his eyes, his upbringing and experiences and understanding of the world. I was just on the constant verge of tears, whether it was out of anger or sadness, because what else are you meant to feel when you know that a specific group of people are completely broken down due to the colour of their skin? Yet, he actually speaks on understanding the 'white’ mentality. This book is full of empathy, it seeps out of every word, every sentence that is constructedHe speaks on identity, the social construct of races, the all American Dream that is a facade and build on the back of slavery, police brutality and the concept of whiteness. It's not all doom and gloom. There is hope, there has to be and he shares beautiful moments in his life where barriers within himself are broken and clarity poured in, that the world is much more than America and the toxic narrative/lifestyle they put forth and the simple wonders of life that we take for granted. I know that this is a book that I'll casually flick through every now again. I've filled it with my thoughts, which I'll probably have to add to as my perspective of this world changes and my own understanding grows. It was truly an an eye-opening read. I feel invigorated and my mind is more curious, hungry and eager to find out more. Initial review.Review to come when I can think straight, but this has to be one of the most harrowing and truthful (modern) accounts on what it means to be black in America. Incredible, incredible book!!121!An America that looks away is ignoring not just the sins of the past but the sins of the present and the certain sins of the future.The moment I really fell for Ta-Nehisi Coates was during his interview on the Diane Rehm’s show after he was asked his opinions on gun control. The question came after a statement by him about the safety of his son living in Paris as opposed to the United States with regard to the rampant gun violence in the US. Gun control is a very ‘hot-button’ issue in the US as of present, and anything this journalist from The Atlantic said was sure to become another .gif in the meme politics of American social media. Coates gave the classiest of answers possible, declining to address an opinion on gun control due to a confessed lack of proper, journalistic research. He listed many socio-political issues he felt he was well-researched upon enough to give an opinion, but on gun control he lacked a ready-built answer complete with statistics and citation so he felt it would be improper to broadcast his opinion on the matter. As Wittgenstein wrote ‘whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.’ This classy response won me over even more so than his reading from his book Between the World and Me,’ though it is highly recommended you listen to his wonderfully cadenced voice recite the pure poetry that flows through his book¹. The National Book Award winning book is written in the form of a letter to his son—' I would have you be a conscious citizen of this terrible and beautiful world.’—and addresses the issues of racism and racial violence prevalent in the United State and how it is a product of American history itself. ‘You cannot forget how much they took from us and how they transfigured our very bodies into sugar, tobacco, cotton, and gold.’ Coates letter is an extraordinarily blunt and honest stance in the depths of storm, highlighting the violent lunacy of racism—‘race is the child of racism, not the father’—opening our eyes to the real immediacy of violence and white privilege in a poise and prose sure to leave readers awestruck in it’s powerful wake.Hate gives identity. The nigger, the fag, the bitch illuminate the border, illuminate what we ostensibly are not, illuminate the Dream of being white, of being a Man. We name the hated strangers and are thus confirmed in the tribe.Around the time I was toying with the idea of picking up this book (I rarely read non-fiction but the rerun of his interview on NPR was the clincher that brought me that very day to a bookstore found on my Wednesday delivery route) I was pulled over one night for a routine traffic stop. The events that followed lead me to understand what the phrase 'check your privilege’ truly meant. To my ignorance, the right, front headlight of my car wasn’t working and when I saw the flashing lights of a county cop I immediately pulled over and fretted over how I would manage to afford the ticket for whatever infraction I had committed. My mind was abuzz with my lack of finances and confusion over what I could possibly have been pulled over for, at no point thinking ‘this could be the moment my life is ended, my body destroyed.’ The police officer was extremely friendly and helpful. It wasn’t until I was driving away that I realized he never asked for my vehicle registration or even bothered to ask if the car was registered in my name. He asked if I had been drinking and when I smiled and said ‘not yet, sir’ he laughed and replied ‘have to ask, don’t worry, I believe you.’ It was a simple experience. In no point was I eyed suspiciously, my car wasn’t searched, the police officer didn’t pull me out readily questioning if I even legally had possession of the car. That was a flat out privilege that I was able to coast through this so easily..Imagine now, if you will, had I been a different race. Social media has been filled in the recent year with police-cam videos showing black men and women treated with hostility from the get-go in routine stops and many horrifying clips that finish with the officer discharging his weapon into an unarmed black motorist. Undoubtedly, my mind would have been on much more than simply 'oh no, how will I pay for this,’ but more along the anxiety lines of ‘am I going to be hauled to jail or killed out of this encounter?’ Yes, I had benefited from a moment of White Privilege, and I can’t just walk away from this without reminding those who also benefit from this to keep it in mind, in constant check, and remember that we coexist with those who do not benefit from this.

Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred. It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others...

Discussing White Privilege is not about discrediting someone’s shortcomings or problems because they are white as many seem to mistake it, it is not about saying white people are less important, it is simply about remembering that your race has dealt you a different hand. For better or for worse. It’s just about being self aware. Much like how Black Lives Matter does not mean White lives don’t matter, but about reminding you that black lives do matter too in a world that sometimes neglects to think about it, that all lives matter. So you must wake up every morning knowing that no promise is unbreakable, least of all the promise of waking up at all. This is not despair. These are the preferences of the universe itself: verbs over nouns, actions over states, struggle over hopeBetween the World and Me delivers horrific account after horrific account of what living on the side of those who are destroyed, as he often puts it, simply for not being of the benefiting race. He reminds you of the fear, the hate, the violence and the fury boiling in the reality of the racial problems in America, and reminds you that it is a man-made and perpetuated problem.
[A]ll our phrasing--race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy--serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this.
 Coates refuses to let the issue be sugar-coated and rubs the reader’s nose in the gore and terror of reality to make sure you will not forget it. He does not make apologies. The naysayers frequently like to dismiss the horrible murders mentioned in the book by pointing out that the victim had been committing a crime, yet this is grossly missing the point. Remember the ‘I can’t breathe!’ incident from a year or so ago, where the man was strangled by a police office responding to him illegally selling cigarettes? His crime in no way negates the fact that his arrest led directly and immediately to his death. ‘Sell cigarettes without the proper authority and your body can be destroyed,’ Coates reminds us. The punishment in no way equals the crime. The police officer should not be the judge, jury and executioner, the punishment of death is not theirs to decide. What is worse is that ‘The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions.’ From Michael Brown to Prince Jones, Coates looks deep into the death of men at the hands of police. ‘All you need to understand is that the officer carries with him the power of the American state and the weight of an American legacy, and they necessitate that of the bodies destroyed every year, some wild and disproportionate number of them will be black.’In order to fully learn a lesson one must not just retain the knowledge but also act upon the knowledge. Don’t just be a sword in it’s scabbard on the battlefield of society. Recognizing white privilege isn’t enough, and neither is writing this review. I must always keep it in mind, recognize it and act with it in each moment and breath like the religiously devout and then reconfigure myself to help others; I must see the message and deliver it for the good of all humankind with each and every action I undertake. I want to take the plunge, to walk that peaceful warrior’s road, and I want you all to walk with me. It’s the only way to a better horizon. Ta-Nehisis Coates emphasizes on one particular race issue, but the message is easily expandable and adaptable to shelter all race, sexual orientation and gender issues under it’s empowering umbrella. I brought a daughter into this world and I don’t want it to be one she will regret having been forced into. This could and should be a world where we don’t see race—it feels necessary to reiterate Ta-Nehisi’s point that race is a symptom, not the infection—or gender, but the human race as a whole. The most common criticisms of Between the World and Me are that he is not saying anything new or, as Eddie Glaude, author of the wonderful Democracy in Black: How Race Still Enslaves the American Soul, states that Ta-Nehisi only questions without offering solutions (far from condemning Ta-Nehisi, Glaude goes on to praise the man for at least asking the right questions in his own interview on the Diane Rehm’s Show). However, what succeeds in heroic fashion for Coates is his infectiously beautiful prose which impregnates the reader with his ideology through the purity of it’s complicated simplicity and power. He opens eyes like a sunrise. We must all take his words to heart. It’s a difficult road, but I’ll take your hand if you’ll take mine and we will squeeze them with the brave reassurance as one would squeeze the hand of a terminal cancer patient. Let us not allow racism to be the tumor of society, let us not fall victim to the fear of the Other. Let us forge a brighter future.4.5/5‘You must resist the common urge toward the comforting narrative of divine law, toward fairy tales that imply some irrepressible justice. The enslaved were not bricks in your road, and their lives were not chapters in your redemptive history. They were people turned to fuel for the American machine. Enslavement was not destined to end, and it is wrong to claim our present circumstance—no matter how improved—as the redemption for the lives of people who never asked for the posthumous, untouchable glory of dying for their children. Our triumphs can never compensate for this’¹ The interview between Coates and Diane Rehm can be found here.!121!“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.”This book was freaking stunning and written so beautiful, the writing is so raw and honest and I can't really put into words how this moved me. This should be required reading as it is very educational and eye opening and I strongly urge everyone to read this. “You are growing into consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict yourself to make other people comfortable.”!121!Drawing on an established tradition by American writers of color, 'Between the World and Me' is Ta-Nehisi Coates' own letter to his son. While I was reading, I heard loud echoes of of black writers passing on their experiences with race issues through their lives, including James Balwin's ""My Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation, 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X and MLK Jr.'s 'Letter from Birmingham Jail.' Interestingly, it also reminded me of Krishnamurti, who talks a great deal about being blinded by the Dream. In his case, Krishnamurti means blinded by the seemingly 'real' and concrete world around us at the expense of the world of the spirit. In Coates' case, he's referring to the degree to which people adopt and believe the (American) Dream and how it and its tradition is defined.""The question is not whether Lincoln truly meant “government of the people “ but what our country has, throughout its history, taken the political term “people “ to actually mean.""There's an intriguing theme running through the book about the importance of control over one's body and space, and the lack of control--both historic and current--black people have over their own. Coates frequently singles out treatment of black skin in the hands of the police, as well as armed citizens, drawing upon the well-publicized cases where black people have died strictly as a result of misconception and racism. His examples and references are wide-ranging and integrated into the writing, sometimes almost as an aside. He doesn't go much into issues of legal justice or the prison system, I think because he is partly consumed with the perception of safety and freedom, when the evidence is in front of us all that people of color are not equally safe or free. He muses on the meaning of freedom of the body and social significance without feeling the need to prove the validity of his perception. If you want to understand racism statistically, look elsewhere. He will not explain for you its ubiquitous nature.""The truth is that the police reflect America and all of its will and fear, and whatever we might make of this country’s criminal justice policy, it cannot be said that it was imposed by a repressive minority.""""I knew that these were theories... that justified the jails springing up around me, that argued for ghettos and projects, that viewed the destruction of the black body as incidental to the preservation of order. According to this theory “safety” was a higher value than justice.""One of my favorite things about Coates--I have more than one--is that his work reflects chewing at the meat of meaning, to find sustenance in what he consumes and experiences. He is very much involved in a Socratic process. He understands meaning, subjectivity, and change, and I loved the way he acknowledges it:""But every time I ask it, the question is refined. That is the best of what the old heads meant when they spoke of being “politically conscious”—as much a series of actions as a state of being, a constant questioning, questioning as ritual, questioning as exploration rather than the search for certainty.""Such questioning seems to lead him to be less optimistic than his forebearers. He lacks the general love of humanity that Baldwin has, and yet who can fault him?""It began to strike me that the point of my education was a kind of discomfort, was the process that would not award me my own especial Dream but would break all the dreams, all the comforting myths of Africa, of America, and everywhere, and would leave me only with humanity in all its terribleness.""Wide-ranging and thoughtful, I'd highly recommend it for anyone. I'd particularly recommend it for white Americans as part of the process of addressing their own beliefs in the Dream, or for Americans of color who might be looking for reflections and validations of some of their own experiences. There's too many people still who don't understand or believe how many Americas there are, and seemingly find it hard to believe that their own (white) experience isn't universal.""History is not solely in our hands. And still you are called to struggle, not because it assures you victory but because it assures you an honorable and sane life.""!121!4.5/5 stars!I listened to the audiobook for this, which was superb, I love that the author narrated it. I do think that I would really benefit from re-reading this physically, as at some points I got lost and not everything stuck in my mind. I want to have the chance to take it slow, savour the incredible writing and really feel the power of his words.!121!Reading this book was like being punched in the gut. But it's a blow I hope more people can take because this book needs to be read.Structured as a letter to his teenage son, Ta-Nehisi Coates writes about what it means to be a black man in America. His writing is eloquent and powerful, beautiful and heartbreaking, strident and yet bleak. When I first started reading, I thought I would finish it in one day because the book isn't very long. But it was so provocative that often I could only read a few pages before I had to set the book down to think about it more deeply. Coates talks about his childhood, his education, his early days of trying to find work as a writer, the fears he has as a parent, and underneath it all is the issue of race. An especially poignant section was when he wrote about a college friend, Prince Jones, who was shot and killed by police. When Coates writes about the treatment of blacks by police, his simmering anger starts to boil.You would be a man one day, and I could not save you from the unbridgeable distance between you and your future peers and colleagues, who might try to convince you that everything I know, all the things I'm sharing with you here, are an illusion, or a fact of a distant past that need not be discussed. And I could not save you from they police, from their flashlights, their hands, their nightsticks, their guns. Prince Jones, murdered by the men who should have been his security guards, is always with me, and I knew that soon he would be with you ...All my life I'd heard people tell their black boys and black girls to ""be twice as good,"" which is to say ""accept half as much."" These words would be spoken with a veneer of religious nobility, as though they evidenced some unspoken quality, some undetected courage, when in fact all they evidenced was the gun to our head and the hand in our pocket. That is how we lose our softness. This is how they steal our right to smile. This epistle is about 150 pages long, but there were so many incredible passages that I think I set a record for percentage of pages marked in one book. Here is another remarkable section, which caused me to scrawl HOLY SH*T on the Post-It:The birth of a better world is not ultimately up to you, though I know, each day, there are grown men and women who tell you otherwise. The world needs saving precisely because of the actions of these same men and women. I am not a cynic. I love you, and I love the world, and I love it more with every new inch I discover. But you are a black boy, and you must be responsible for your body in a way that other boys cannot know. Indeed, you must be responsible for the worst actions of other black bodies, which, somehow, will always be assigned to you. And you must be responsible for the bodies of the powerful — the policeman who cracks you with a nightstick will quickly find his excuse in your furtive movements. And this is not reducible to just you — the women around you must be responsible for their bodies in a way that you never will know. You have to make peace with the chaos, but you cannot lie. You cannot forget how much they took from us and how they transfigured our very bodies into sugar, tobacco, cotton and gold. After reading that page, I immediately emailed a colleague who teaches an African American Literature course to make sure she knew about this book. She emailed back that she had read it and loved it, and described Coates as being ""the James Baldwin of our time."" I like that quote, but I think even James Baldwin would be depressed that this book had to be written in 2015. We can be better. More Good Quotes""I write you in your fifteenth year. I am writing you because this was the year you saw Eric Garner chocked to death for selling cigarettes; because you know now that Renisha McBride was shot for seeking help, that John Crawford was shot down for browsing in a department store. And you have seen men in uniform drive by and murder Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old child whom they were oath-bound to protect. And you have seen men in the same uniforms pummel Marlene Pinnock, someone's grandmother, on the side of a road. And you know now, if you did not before, that the police departments of your country have been endowed with the authority to destroy your body. It does not matter if the destruction is the result of an unfortunate overreaction. It does not matter if it originates in a misunderstanding. It does not matter if the destruction springs from a foolish policy ... The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions. And destruction is merely the superlative form of a dominion whose prerogatives include frisking, detaining, beatings, and humiliations. All of this is common to black people. And all of this is old for black people. No one is held responsible.""""To be black in the Baltimore of my youth was to be naked before the elements of the world, before all the guns, fists, knives, crack, rape, and disease. The nakedness is not an error, nor pathology. The nakedness is the correct and intended result of policy, the predictable upshot of people forced for centuries to live under fear. The law did not protect us. And now, in your time, the law has become an excuse for stopping and frisking you, which is to say, for furthering the assault on your body. But a society that protects some people through a safety net of schools, government-backed home loans, and ancestral wealth but can only protect you with the club of criminal justice has either failed at enforcing its good intentions or has succeeded at something much darker. However you call it, the result was our infirmity before the criminal forces of the world. It does not matter if the agent of those forces is white or black — what matters is our condition, what matters is the system that makes your body breakable.""""I think now of the old rule that held that should a boy be set upon in someone else's chancy hood, his friends must stand with him, and they must all take their beating together. I now know that within this edict lay the key to all living. None of us were promised to end the fight on our feet, fists raised to the sky. We could not control our enemies' number, strength, nor weaponry. Sometimes you just caught a bad one. But whether you fought or ran, you did it together, because that is the part that was in our control. What we must never do is willingly hand over our own bodies or the bodies of our friends.""""I urge you to struggle. Struggle for the memory of your ancestors. Struggle for wisdom. Struggle for the warmth of The Mecca. Struggle for your grandmother and grandfather, for your name. But do not struggle for the Dreamers. Hope for them. Pray for them, if you are so moved. But do not pin your struggle on their conversion. The Dreamers will have to learn to struggle themselves, to understand that the field for their Dream, the stage where they have painted themselves white, is the deathbed of us all.""!121!This is an extremely important book that should be read. I am late to the party so there is not much for me to say that others haven't.I listened to the audio version of this book. The one thing I will say is that I had to start and stop the audio so many times that I found myself frustrated. I think that I will listen to it again when I am alone with nothing to distract me. For now I'm giving it 4 Stars. It is only a little over 3 hours long and extremely well narrated by the author. People are correct when they say this should be required reading. If you are going to listen to the audio version make sure you have enough time to listen to it in one or two sittings without distractions.Highly recommended to anyone who has yet to read it.!121!I honestly do not feel right putting a rating on this man's experiences, heartfelt thoughts and wishes for his son. I grew up in Chicago and I have seen more than my fair share of the racial divide. Yet, I have never before read an eye opening book like this one. I am not going to express my views on what I think of what he wrote, my opinions have no place here. This is his viewpoint, shared by many of the black race and that is what I found astonishing, because it gave me an inside look at how they feel and why they might react the way they do. Well written, better in some parts than others but yes a must read, regardless of where you stand on the race issue.!121!Damn I hated this book, and it really surprises me to say that, because I thought that I would like this book. I thought that it would be thought-provoking, deep look at racism in contemporary America. It was not.Instead, it was basically the rantings of a very, very angry man. And hey, who am I to say that Coates doesn't deserve to be angry? I don't know him. I wouldn't want to, either, after reading this book, to be honest. But Coates seems to attribute every slight, perceived or real, as being attributable to white people and white oppression. Now, before I continue, allow me to say that I do not check the ""white"" box when I have to fill out forms. I am not white. I am Jewish. And people may feel like they have the right to tell me that I am white (Coates amongst them, actually), but that is NOT change the fact that I do not see myself as white. Growing up, trust me, it was made abundantly clear in my small town that I was other. So when a young black man is shot and killed, without provocation, by a black police officer working for a predominantly black county, whose fault is it?White people, according to Coates.And when a white woman pushes Coates' son because she is in a hurry, why did she do it? Is it because she is a jerk and would likely push any child out of the way? Nope, it's because she's white and she has to express her white privilege.Dude, look, I've been in New York City, and I would likely be perceived as white, and I have been pushed out of the way numerous times by people all shades of the rainbow. I don't attribute it to racism. I attribute it to people being jackasses. Coates really strikes me as being the type who will look for racism in anything and find it just to prove his point.And he strikes me as a racist himself.“When people who are not black are interested in what I do, frankly, I’m always surprised,” Coates said. “I don’t know if it’s my low expectations for white people or what.” (interview with New York Magazine, July 12, 2015)Does that sound racist to you?How about if this was said instead: ""When people who are not white are interested in what I do, frankly, I'm always surprised,"" [white author] said. ""I don't know if it's my low expectation for black people or what.""Does THAT sound racist to you?Your answer should be the same to both questions. If it's not, check yourself.He also seems to believe that the lives of white children resemble those idyllic ones portrayed on sitcoms, filled with toys and love and carefree living. His life, of course, was different because he was black. It wasn't because of class - it was because of race. Now, I know that class and race can be intertwined, but let me tell you, having grown up in Appalachia, that isn't necessarily so. He might think me ""white,"" but my childhood was a lot of being hungry and poor and wondering how cold it would get that night because our heat was turned off again and pissing in a bucket at night because it was too damned far to walk to the outhouse in the dark.This is probably the most disappointing book I've read all year.!121!Powerful. Thought provoking. I listened to Ta-Nehisi Coates book, Between the World and Me, on audiotape. It is superbly narrated by Coates. As the father of a young son, he reflects on American history and the critical experiences in his lifetime to purposefully parent and raise his son. It is deeply moving and I believe everyone should read or listen to Between the World and Me.Some of the memorable passages include:* Schools are not concerned about curiosity, they are concerned about compliance* Schools conceal the truth rather than reveal the truth* The pursuit of reading is freedom* The craft of writing is the art of thinking* Hate gives identity* We give names to groups of strangers we hate* Poetry defined my thinking* We must make peace with the chaos* Embrace chaos and discord* Question what you see* Blacks are told to be twice as good....and to expect and accept half as much!121!Holy shit this book. I broke down into tears on the subway upon finishing the last page. As a very privileged white woman I don't feel like I have much right to talk about this book but I hope when it comes out everyone else talks about it because it is beautiful and devastating and has the potential to be so important.!121!A Letter To A Teenage Son   A Letter To Me  A Letter To You""Never forget that for 250 years black people were born into chains---whole generations followed by more generations who knew nothing but chains"".""To be black and beautiful was not a matter for gloating. Being black did not immunize us from history's logic or the lure of the Dream. The writer, and that was what I was becoming, must be wary of every Dream and every nation, even his own nation. Perhaps his own nation more than any other, precisely because it was his own"". ""The fact of history is that black people have not ---probably no people have ever---liberated themselves strictly through their own efforts. And every great change in the lives of African-Americans we see the hand of events that were beyond our individual control, events that were not unalloyed goods. You cannot disconnect our emancipation in Northern colonies from the blood spilled in the Revolutionary War, anymore and you can disconnect ouremancipation from slavery in the South from the channel houses of the Civil War, anymore than you can disconnect our emancipation from Jim Crow from the genocides of the Second World War. History is not solely in our hands. And still you are called to struggle, not because it assures you victory but because it assures you an honorable and sane life. I am ashamed of how I acted that day, ashamed of endangering your body. But I am not ashamed because I am a bad father, a bad individual or ill mannered. I am ashamed that I made an error, knowing that our errors always cost us more"".""Had I informed this woman that when she pushed my son, she was acting according to tradition that held black bodies as lesser, her response would likely have been, ""I am not a racist."" Or maybe not. But my experience in this world has been that people who believe themselves to be white are obsessed with the politics of personnel exoneration. And the wordracist, to them, conjures, if not a tobacco-spitting oaf, then something just as fantastic---an orc, troll, or gorgon"". Coates takes us on a journey in Baltimore, with the Black Mecca of Howard University, New York, and Paris...He tells his son...""struggle for your grandmother and grandfather, for your name. But do not struggle for the Dreamers. Hope for them. Pray for them, if you are so moved. But do not pin your struggle on their conversation. The Dreamers will have to learn to struggle themselves, to understand that the field for their Dream, the stage where they have painted themselves white, is a deathbed of us all"". The Dream is the same habit that endangers the planet, the same habit that sees our bodies stowed away in prisons and ghettos"". Tips Guidance/Advice Warnings/Awaken!121!I read this book first in October, and now read it again with my Language and Literacy grad class. We had a pretty lively discussion about this book and three articles I provide links to below with respect Coates' views on reparations for Arican Americans.This is a short book by Coates, who was in 2015 awarded one of the MacArthur ""genius"" grants, AND the National Book Award for Non-Fiction for this book. I recommend your checking it out. It comes in the form of a letter to his teenaged son, and it's essentially a short memoir. While books as letters are a recognized form, this one seems inspired by James Baldwin’s letter to his nephew, The Fire Next Time. Both are passionate and painful to read at times.I am a middle aged white guy, 63, which places me as someone who was in school in the sixties, and one of those liberals who was transformed by the Civil Rights movement--the riots, watching Black Power emerge (hey, I even went to SDS meetings in Ann Arbor in 1968, and attended a gathering of SDS and Black Panthers in those years, too)--as well as the Women's movement, the rise of environmentalism, and one heck of a lot of great music. I was the kind of kid who read Mao's Little Red Book when I was 16 and was preparing for The Revolution, even as I saw MLK, Bobby and JFK shot down. I grew my hair for a time in some kind of white man's version of an Afro.I was an English major, a reader, so I read Ellison's Invisible Man, MLK, Malcolm, and all the essential James Baldwin. And Toni Morrison's Nobel prize perspective on race in literature. In recent years I have seen the left divided into camps, and have despaired of claims that any one thing is the reason the US of A is going to hell, which is a perspective trumpeted by Marxists, Feminists, GlBT activists, and a group that identifies itself with Critical Race Theory (CRT) that sees race as the the single most important defining issue in the U.S. today. I do think this country and world is going to hell, but I think it is a range of interconnected issues. Some folks call that intersectionality. Or just not subscribing to the single bullet theory. Though maybe I think at the moment that Class more than anything trumps most things, which means Coates thinks I am a typical white liberal. A Bernie kinda guy. Guilty as charged. Ayn Rand as the new-liberal icon.I think I slowed down reading much theory about race a few years ago, not sure I hadn't heard it all before. Of course the killing of young black people by police has outraged me and I have been part of protests and petitions. And I live in Chicago, where young black kids are killed on a daily and alarming basis. There's an economic explanation, and a racial one, and in Chicago these are entertwined, in my opinion.But when Toni Morrison says Coates is the best black intellectual since James Baldwin, says it is ""required reading,"" well, I listen, and read. I also had read some of his writing for The Atlantic Monthly, so I knew who he was. It's true, the perspective in general is one which I am generally familiar with, but what makes this a real contribution is the quality of the writing: passionate, fresh, engaged, loving, angry, and (somewhat) redemptive. His concern is with the centuries old destruction of black bodies that didn't just end in slavery. His starting point is the alarming cop killings and innocent verdicts, but along the way he tells his story to his son, and it is a tale of Malcolm X, Howard University, and the senseless murder of one Howard (The Mecca) University friend in particular, Prince Jones, who was remarkable and brilliant and good, who was the only black kid attending a Texas prep school, and whose mother is a successful radiologist. A black child of privilege, in many ways, whose family is cut down by one act of racism. Money didn’t protect his black skin.Coates visits Dr. Jones in his last chapter, who talks calmly but clearly of her dead son and the country she did everything right to succeed in, but whom, in spite of everything, became (merely) black, cast aside in some ways by the very Dream ""of those who believe themselves to be white."" It's a pretty powerful book, a provocative perspective, and often as saddening as it is enraging. The best thing about it for me as a reader and writer is that there are sentences on every page that could only have been written by him, that astonish with grace and power. How can we be surprised by any writer in a book about race in 2015? But it does, and you will be, and I was. I highly recommend you check it out.And here's a link to his Reparations essay:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/a...And after hearing some criticism about the essay, his response:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/a...And a smart critique of Coates' position on reparations from Cedric Johnson:https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/ta...","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Social Justice', 'Biography']"
The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Paperback),Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,811864,2000,"The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.","This book is fascinating and I was disappointed to read that many other readers didn't think so. So here's my response. I think those readers are approaching this book the wrong the way when they critisize Gladwell for his inability to prove his points thoroughly. Sure, Gladwell could have dotted every i and crossed every t and shown every counter-example to the theories he's proposing. There's a word for the books that accomplish that: BORING. Gladwell is a storyteller and he knows how to keep the reader involved. By going into too much detail, he would lose his audience. Hopefully the reader who isn't convinced entirely can go into further detail by reading Gladwell's sources which are exhaustively referenced in the back of the book. Another criticism is that Gladwell doesn't come to a specific point or that his points are hazy (this was probably more true with ""Blink""). I almost want to say ""who cares?"" This book and ""Blink"" are veritable digests of the latest advances in psychology and sociology. So what if the overarching idea of the book is loose? You have now understood countless fascinating anecdotes which you can reconstruct in your own way. It is Gladwell's loose structure that allows him to connect these disparate dots in a story that you can digest, and despite the accusations that he is not precise about his overall thesis, the individual incidents are very well explained. I love knowing the differences between Sesame Street and Blue's Clues and the differences between an adult's and a child's cognitive capabilities. Would I have read an entire book devoted solely to that? Probably not, but I was happy to read a chapter devoted to it, and a very well-written one at that.Perhaps I approach non-fiction in a different way than most--and I will admit that I'm fascinated by almost any new, dramatically different idea about any subject, regardless of whether or not I believe it to be true--but I think that people who go into this book seeking a different way of thinking about the world around us, macro & microcosmically, will enjoy themselves. Those who go into the book seeking to be convinced beyond doubt that that way of thinking is the correct way, will not.!121!This book grew out of an article Malcolm Gladwell was writing for the New Yorker. Frankly, it is better suited for a 5-7 page article rather than a 280 page book. The crux of the book is that the ""stickiness factor"" of epidemics (whatever the nature) begins with a tipping point. This tipping point arises because of three distinct sets of individuals: mavens, connectors and salespeople. He also examines the well-known S-curve which begins with innovators, then early adopters, followed by the early majority and finally, the late majority. He is overwhelmingly redundant in expressing his ideas, providing examples of epidemics throughout the text while comparing them to one another (children's television, Hushpuppy shoes, Paul Revere's ride, nicotine, and the list goes on and on...). The Conclusion, the eighth and final chapter, was pointless: if the reader did not understand Gladwell's point by now, he or she must have been as lost as Washington Redskins' new coach Jim Zorn when he commented his family was proud to wear maroon and black.All that said, the book was not horrible. It was a well written first person narrative and the lessons of the emergence of epidemics are applicable to almost any career or lifestyle, as Gladwell demonstrated with his countless examples.!121!Can I give this zero stars?When I read this book, back in 2006, I got really mad and wrote a scathing review of it on Amazon.com. Here it is:""I've been duped!, June 20, 2006By Sarah (California, USA) - See all my reviewsThis book sucks. Don't waste your hard earned money on it. Let me save you a few bucks here: Malcolm Gladwell is either a self-aggrandizing ass who is too busy thinking he is the god of marketing to notice that a great majority of his arguments lack any kind of cohesion or credibility whatsoever, or he is just so excited about his self-proclaimed 'paradigmatic' keys to the essense of social epidemics that he conveniently forgets to include that much needed credible evidence to support his long-winded theories, resulting in a book fit to satiate the appetite of audiences hungry for pop pseudo-science BS that will make them feel smart for reading it. Basically all this book is is a compilation of anecdotal evidence that is supposed to prove the truth in his words. Gladwell's arguments clearly violate some very important rules guiding intelligent thought: correlation does not imply causation (and the fact that two events happened on one occasion at the same time does not necessarily imply correlation), and the idea that a theory is bankable because one instance of anecdotal evidence exists. Umm, okay, that's like saying that I know a guy who won the lottery (I don't, but humor me), so it must be a logically good place to invest my paychecks (I don't have paychecks, but, please, humor me). I mean, I'm a 21-year-old college student, and not even a GOOD college student at that, and I could easily point out the flaws in his arguments -not just a single argument, but ALL of his arguments -as soon as I read them. I didn't even have to put the book down to think for a few minutes before I realized how absolutely pointless and downright ludicrous his 'insights' were. All that aside, his writing style is so patronizing and self-congratulatory that I could hardly stand to read any more than five pages at a time before my face got all scrunched up and I started uncontrollably muttering curse words under my breath. It makes me sad that people read this book and consider it a revelation in modern psychological and scientific thinking, not seeing it for what it is: an apparently very successful (thanks, readers of America) profit-driven waste of time. Gladwell made a ton of money off what probably only took him, like, 15 minutes to write, and THAT is the only thing genius about this book.""Yeah, I was kinda mad when I wrote that. This book doesn't really do much in the way of illustrating how to market ideas -rather, it seems more like a marketing tool itself. Gladwell sure knows how to create a brand for himself, complete with a legion of raving followers who can't think for themselves. That scares me.!121!How the flying fuck did this piece of shit ever get published? How on God's green earth did this thing become a bestseller? Yes, I'm the last person in America to read The Tipping Point, and I'm glad I waited. Now that all the hype has burned off, it's easy to see this book for what it is: a very well crafted collection of half-truths and speculation, sold as ""truth"".Let's look at one example. I read The Tipping Point as an ebook, so my pages might not match completely with yours, but it's the story about the AIDS virus, Chapter One, Section 2, page 24. In writing about a weird epidemic among newborns in the 1950s, Gladwell says of the lead scientist, ""Goudsmit thinks that this was an early HIV epidemic.""Nothing wrong with that. Gladwell is reporting what a scientist thinks. Gladwell then offers an extended quote from Dr. Goudsmit, which is loaded with conditional statements: ""this adult could have died of AIDS"", ""he could have transmitted the virus"", ""she could have given birth to an HIV infected child"", ""unsterilized needles could have spread the virus"". Again, all well and good: Goudsmit was speculating, and making it clear that what he was saying was not certain, but that it ""could have"" happened.Then Gladwell returns and destroys the careful foundation he had built by making concrete statements about things that a moment before were only hypotheses: ""They defeated HIV"", ""The strains of HIV circulating in the 1950s were a lot different from the HIV circulating today"", ""HIV itself changed"" None of this is proven by any of the information Gladwell gave us. All of it is speculation. But Gladwell draws firm conclusions from things that are, at best, educated guesses. I'm sorry but that's just wrong. Actually, I'm not sorry. What Gladwell did is so wrong it's unforgivable.I've been a journalist for 20 years, and I work with some of the finest fact checkers in the world. If I ever handed in a badly reasoned piece of shit like this book, they'd tear me a new asshole. (No they wouldn't. They're very nice people. But they would tear the manuscript a new asshole, as they should.) More to the point, I have enough respect for myself, my readers, and my fact checkers that I'd never hand in something like this in the first place. That Gladwell thought he could get away with it (and let's face it, he did get away with it) is metaphorically criminal. Fuck him.!121!Really good book. It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think.three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context.Law of the Few (people who influence): - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into ""conversational harmony"" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan.Stickyness Factor - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show was good. - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. - make the message personal to make it memorable The Power of Context - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways.  - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.!121!I think missed the best by date for this book. It's more fun than an introductory course in sociology and covers some of the same material. Reminded me of Bellwether by Connie Willis and William Gibson's Blue Ant series. All looking for the point where people change behavior and a new trend begins.I loved the part about creating the children's education tv programs Sesame Street and Blue's Clues. What worked with preschoolers, and what didn't.It seems likely Gladwell relies on his enthusiasm for his theory more than fact. That being said, I'll probably read more of his books. It's good food for thought.!121!Here’s why you need to read The Tipping Point. You don’t!!Look, it’s not because the writing is poor, the concepts disorganized, or the book fails to instruct. It’s simply that the ideas are anachronistic. This is no fault of Malcolm Gladwell. He published in 2000, wrote in ‘99, and used case studies from the mid-90’s. How could he have known he was publishing a book about social media on the eve of social media’s inchoate move into our social DeoxyriboNucleicAcid, or that the overgrowth of social connectedness would evolve at rates understated by the term logarithmic.This is a snappy little book--a good one for Thursday evening book club affairs. I quite liked it. Digestible chapters with jaunty titles, connecting for the reader complex sociocultural beliefs to gravid marketing slogans. Pert discussion, and a context that builds on previous conclusions, leading the audience like an unbridled horse gently to water. Gladwell, he’s a good salesman, one that can close a deal without hiding a rotten premolar or repeatedly glancing at his wristwatch. It’s 3.5 stars.Nevertheless, if you’ve fogged a mirror in the last 10 years, much of what Gladwell worked hard to synthesize in year 2000 is merely a matter of course in the mercurial, social, connected life we lead today. Essentially the book is about marketing. (There’s more herein than marketing, but that’s what I’d like to focus on). The title underscores a link throughout the book, viz., that no matter the medium, information reaches a ‘tipping’ point beyond which it spreads above and away from any reasonable measure of altitude control. He repeatedly uses the term epidemic, and I like the image that word conjures in my mind when I think of how pervasive and persistent and contagious marketing can be (like the scene in Ten Commandments where the pestilence of God’s wrath moves down from the moon and like a swampy yellow miasma flows through the streets of Ramses’s Egypt) . Gladwell lays down some meaty discussion about the ‘whys’ and ‘wherefore's’ of the nature of networked relationships, using sociology, psychology, penal philosophy, genetics, pop culture, economics, archeobiology, and personal interviews. It’s a snapshot of a fossil, though. He is in essence describing our world when information was still Near Real Time (NRT), a military acronym meaning ‘actionable’ but not ‘exactable.’ We upgraded that acronym circa 2004-2006 when information became--no shit--Real Time. Real Time worldwide data is a phenomena we’ve only recently begun to comprehend and manipulate. Write a discussion about how your start-up can triangulate consumers, and you’ll have a lead story in Harvard Business Review. Develop an android app that geolocates high volume consumers, and Starbucks will give $$credit$$ to the first 10 people that check into their stores in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Chattanooga. Twitter trends topics, not daily, but hourly. Google Metrics displays global boolean traffic on word searches RIGHT NOW. Crowdsourcing, flash mobs, #hashtags. I can set a Google alert that pings me the next time Brittany Spears has an inadvertent bush shot at the Palms Casino. I can scan barcodes on my phone, and know by a factor of pennies where I can get the cheapest sun dried tomatoes. I can listen to any law enforcement scanner in the country while sitting in my tighty-whities in my fall-out basement. Gowalla, Foursquare, StumbleUpon, grooveshark, HTML5, mashable, MMORPGs, skype, Goodreads. And the every present memes--viral video memes, photo memes--Christ, look at the major news networks during an election and watch the TV anchors in the studio move to the floating, diaphanous plates of glass and enlarge voting counties and predict elections with two-fingered zoom.Malcolm Gladwell could not have foreseen the breadth and rapidity of tipping points in today’s market. No one could have--not even industry leaders in year 2000. Tipping points are not isolated events anymore, like the slow resurgence of Hush Puppy shoes from 1994-1996 (the most cited tipping point in the book, and one Gladwell considers--by his own criteria--rapid). They are daily memes, forcing us into ever tighter circles of consumption, and causing many of us to brux our teeth when we lose cell coverage or go to airplane mode on our smart phones. SMART PHONES--a technology by itself that puts the rust on Gladwell’s conception of tipping points. Despite sound research methodology, and pertinent statistical evaluation, I don’t envision many people going back to The Tipping Point. It’s like reading last week’s headlines; last year’s Consumer Reports; financial data from 2008; political promises from 2006; real estate values from 2005, or the Manhattan skyline on 10 Sep 2001. Maybe for an anecdotal dissertation by some students squirreled away at Weber State or Lehigh University, but other than that I think most of the 77,000 Goodread reviews of this book occurred much nearer the time it was on the best seller list in 2000-2001. There are 4 copies available at my library. It ain’t flying off the shelves anymore, and neither is the 1994 Rand McNally Atlas. You dig?But, wait, let’s go deeper. I dogeared these passages.Here are the titles of the 4 parts of this book. I.EpidemicsII. The Law of the Few: Connectors, Mavens, and SalesmenIII. The Stickiness FactorIV. The Power of Context-- These are important constituents in marketing, but Gladwell speaks of months and years. We both know it's days and hours in 2011.What was the connection between the East Village and Middle America? The Law of the Few says the answer is that one of these exceptional people found out about the trend, and through social connections and energy and enthusiasm and personality spread the word about Hush Puppies. (p. 22)-- Social connectedness was an ephemeral measurement in 1999. Now organizations have followers (see Facebook and Twitter) and can measure their daily virility (see the ‘like’ button and most-viewed videos on Youtube) and watch their epidemic spread (see trending topics on technorati or mashable or gizmodo).It is safe to say that word of mouth is--even in this age of mass communications and multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns--still the most important form of human communication. Think, for a moment, about the last expensive restaurant you went to, the last expensive piece of clothing you bought, and the last movie you saw. In how many of those cases was your decision about where to spend your money heavily influenced by the recommendation of a friend...word-of-mouth appeals have become the only kind of persuasion that most of us respond to anymore. (p. 32)-- Yes, word of mouth is, indeed, persuasive. But, today we are motivated and persuaded even more by word of text!!!Your friends...occupy the same world that you do. They might work with you, or live near you, and go to the same churches, schools, or parties. How much, then, would they know that you wouldn’t know? Your acquaintances, on the other hand, by definition occupy a very different world than you. They are much more likely to know something that you don’t... Acquaintances, in short, represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more powerful you are. (p. 54)-- This is perhaps Gladwell’s most prophetic statement. I know more people today having never met face to face than actual people I knew in 1999.Mavens have the knowledge and the social skills to start word-of-mouth epidemics. What sets Mavens apart, though, is not so much what they know but how they pass it along. The fact that Mavens want to help, for no other reason than because they like to help, turns out to be an awfully effective way of getting someone’s attention. (p. 67)-- Today Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and Ben Affleck, combined, have more ‘followers’ than the population of Panama.We have become, in our society, overwhelmed by people clamoring for our attention. In just the past decade, the time devoted to advertisements in a typical hour of network television has grown from 6 minutes to 9 minutes, and it continues to climb every year...estimates that the average American is now exposed to 254 different commercial messages in a day, up nearly 25% since the mid-1970s. There are now millions of web sites on the Internet, cable systems routinely carry over 50 channels of programming, and a glance inside the magazine section of any bookstore will tell you that there are thousands of magazines coming out each month... (p. 98)-- Multiply all of the above figures by a factor of 10 to the 2nd power. A rate of growth that cannot be compared by measuring from 1999 back to the existence of Abraham.The spread of any new and contagious ideology has a lot to do with the skillful use of group power. (p. 172)-- The skillful use of group power makes me feel violated in today’s marketing environment.!121!The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, Malcolm GladwellGladwell defines a tipping point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point"". The book seeks to explain and describe the ""mysterious"" sociological changes that mark everyday life.

Malcolm Gladwell's own take on this is what The Tipping Point is mostly about. And it sure is interesting.""Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push - in just the right place - it can be tipped.""This is a relatively short book - compared to some other books on same subject - and attempts to explain the author's three principles with the help of some well known 'social epidemics'.

You realise, of course, I’m talking about intellectually stimulating or satisfying when I say sexy. That is what I want to talk about – the thing that gives me my biggest intellectual buzz.Look, it isn’t any of the obvious things you might be thinking of – and all of those obvious things this book has in abundance. Not that I actually read this book – I listened to it as an audio book, and that is important to say because I don’t know if the book always has the afterword – and it is something in the afterword that I loved most about this otherwise merely wonderful book. (As you may have guessed, we will be returning to this later)What I’m saying is that Gladwell is a sexy kind of guy anyway, even before he did the best of all possible things in the afterword of this book. He is what I like to call an interpreter. I think he even refers to himself as this somewhere. He straddles a number of worlds – psychology, medicine, marketing, social theory, economics – and he draws lines between those worlds in the way one might if one was to place a piece of plastic film over another piece of plastic film on an overhead projector, so that what is written on both films of plastic merge to ‘complete the picture’ in beautifully interesting ways. Now, that is sexy – but it is only level one sexy. I love watching relationships and patterns appear and I love a good story and Gladwell knows his stuff when it comes to patterns and he really knows how to tell a good story. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing the matter with level one sexy – but it is intellectual foreplay and needs something more to be truly satisfying.One of the things this book is about is trends. How do trends start? What makes it fashionable for kids to start smoking? Why do books by unknown authors suddenly become best sellers? How is it that two people can do much the same thing (and he gives a fascinating example from American History to explain this) and yet have completely different (in fact, nearly opposite) results?Or why did Hush Puppies, a brand of shoes that had virtually died, suddenly become – in the lingo of the streets – uber-cool? (Yes, I know, ‘don’t try being cool, McCandless, it really doesn’t suit’.)Essentially, he talks about a small number of personality types that exist in the world that kick trends along, and these types of people help make ‘the virus of the latest thing’ spread to us all. Those types of people are, communicators (people who know essentially everyone), mavens (people who know essentially everything) and salesmen. Sometimes we think that if we want to spread an idea far and wide we should find a way to get it to as many people as possible – much like spam. But when was the last time you bought something recommended to you from a piece of spam you received in your inbox? See what I mean. But I guess most of us know some car nut we go to when we are thinking of buying a car, someone who reads all the car magazines and (maybe) even spends his (it is always a boy) weekends ‘test driving’ the latest models. This is the sort of person who can not only tell you the difference between an overhead cam-shaft and polyunsaturated margarine, but also why the cam-shaft is better than butter. (In case you have not quite worked it out yet, I am not one of those mavens)In a world awash with ‘information’ – much of which is lies (although it is probably best we call it by its more polite name, advertising) – we are becoming, ironically enough, more dependent on word of mouth information from sources we know we can trust. Now, isn’t that a wonderful thesis and a direct confirmation of what you probably already suspected, but hadn’t put into words yet. I guess this might be the second level of intellectual sexy.The next level towards intellectual nirvana is when someone says something totally unexpected that makes my brains resonate in a way that I know will have me thinking for weeks. And he did that this morning as I was walking back from the beach by talking about collective memory. This is penultimate in the scale of intellectual sexy – I knew when he said this that what he was saying was going to end up in my review.They did a test on people, they put people through a series of remembering tasks – and they gave them these tests in pairs. Some of the pairs were people who didn’t know each other from a bar of soap – and the others were people who were literally couples, people in relationships. And the result? Well, the people in the relationships did lots and lots better at remembering stuff than the people that the fickle hand of fate flung together. Isn’t that fascinating? Doesn’t that send a shiver down your spine? But it gets better. He then goes on to talk about why this might be the case – and essentially he claims that we use our partners as a memory extension slot for our own brains. In a relationship there is a division of labour when it comes to remembering stuff – with one partner remembering the kids’ birthdays and the other remembering how to use the ice cream maker.And now comes the bucket of ice water that made me stop on my walk and think, “God, now, isn’t that really, really interesting”. Part of the reason people fall into a deep depression when they go through a divorce (and I thought, perhaps even die shortly after their ‘life partner’dies) may not just be that their partner has metaphorically taken away a part of their heart, but literally taken away a part of their brain. It is that line from Laurie Anderson about when her father died how she felt like a library had burnt down (I think from The Ugly One with Jewels, just before Speak My Language, but I could be wrong).But do you know what is the sexiest thing about this book? And the reason why you should avoid a first edition and get an edition with the afterword? It is that after he has built a pretty good case for something, made a rather good comparison that he uses to sustain the last bit of the book, after he has finished writing the book, after it is printed and ‘done and dusted’, he thinks about it some more and makes a couple of major revisions to some of his thinking in the afterword that goes in a later edition. It is utterly clear to me that if he had the chance to write this book again he would do it differently. Essentially, the afterword is showing us how he would have made it different. He is showing that no idea is ever finished with, no idea can be finally put aside as a shining trophy, only to gather dust and bird shit, but ideas are only worthy of that name if they are alive and alive things change and grow or sometimes they sicken and die.And someone who does that, that goes away and thinks about it even after it is done and finished with and then comes back and says, “Actually, I could have done that a bit better, let me see if I can just say it this way…” Now, that is sexy – that is the best. This book is not nearly as good as Outliers, and I only read this book because I read that book. But do you know what? This book is good enough that if I’d read this book first I would have gone on read that book too.!121!The biography of a very simple ideaThe back cover marketing blurb describes it very simply. “THE TIPPING POINT is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.” The introduction covers that summary in slightly greater detail, “It is the best way to understand the emergence of fashion trends, the ebb and flow of crime waves, or, for that matter, the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth, … Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.”Teachers, advertising executives, business owners, politicians, social workers, authors and the like would do very well to read Malcolm Gladwell’s brilliant musings concerning the characteristics of “epidemic” style societal change – contagiousness; little causes can have enormous effects; and change happens, not gradually, but a single dramatic moments. I’m not sure that I learned anything that would affect my personal life or cause me to change my behaviour in any way but there is no question that I did learn stuff and I also enjoyed the ride.Indeed, there is every likelihood that if I had read THE TIPPING POINT as a young man, I would almost certainly have added Psychology as an elective to my university course list. It’s compelling, convincing and astonishingly interesting. BLINK, another of Malcolm Gladwell’s work, was just as amazing and I’ll look forward eagerly to trying more. OUTLIERS and TALKING TO STRANGERS come to mind as top of the list candidates.(On a related note, I'm wondering, given the world's current overwhelming concern with Coronavirus pandemic, if any public health officials have given thought to applying Gladwell's ideas to the intractable problem of persuading blockheaded American anti-vaxxers to change their minds??)Paul Weiss!121!The book that became a catchphrase! The term ""tipping point"" has become so commonly used in news stories that I wonder how many people know it came from a book.I read this back in 2000 when I was in grad school for sociology. It's a fun little book of case studies, many of which applied to what I was learning in my classes. Here it is 13 years later and I can still recall many of the details and theories, which shows how interesting I thought they were. Gladwell, who writes for The New Yorker, has a skill of weaving different elements and stories together into an enjoyable narrative. The gist of the book is how information spreads among people -- why do some ideas/products spread quickly and effectively, but others don't? Are there kinds of people who are better at transmitting information? (Hint: Yes, there are.)Some of the stories I remember best are about how ""Sesame Street"" was founded and its impact on literacy (it's surprisingly high!); how to reduce the spread of HIV among drug addicts; how the size of an office can enhance the feeling of community among its workers; how suicide can become more widespread in a region if someone of high stature commits it; and how crime can rise and fall in a city.But perhaps the most salient concept I still use is about connectors vs. mavens. A connector is someone who knows lots and lots of people. They are extroverts and are good at making casual acquaintances wherever they go. In contrast, a maven is a Yiddish term that means one who accumulates knowledge. These are people who gain the respect of friends and colleagues for giving good advice, so when they recommend something, the advice is usually followed. (For example, as a librarian I try to be a maven of good books.) Advertisers are interested in mavens because their opinions carry weight. Gladwell gives several examples of the differences between connectors and mavens, the main one being that the advice of a connector is not always taken even though he/she may give it to more people (because they know more people), but almost everyone follows the advice of a maven, even though they may give it to fewer people. So a maven might have more of an impact on spreading an idea.It would be interesting to reread this book now to see how it holds up, because many of these ideas seem to have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. I think I would still recommend it to anyone interested in some pop sociology.!121!کتاب عالی ای بود، اولش یکم سرد شروع میشه و موضوعش تکراری بنظر میاد ولی تو بخش the law of the few اوج میگیره. مفاهیم connector و maven و salesman فوق العاده جالب و کاربردی بود مخصوصا برای افرادی که به بیزینس و روان شناسی علاقه دارن. توی بخش the stickness factor با اینکه موضوع جالبه ولی باز یکم معمولی میشه و جزئیات زیادی مطرح میشه که لزومی نداره ولی دوباره تو بخش power of context اوج میگیره. دو فصل راجب context هست که هم فواید کاری هم فواید فردی و شخصی میتونه براتون داشته باشه. در کل بسیار لذت بردم از خوندن این کتاب گرچه هنوز outliers تو کتاب های گلدول بهترینه بنظرم. واسه کتاب بعدی سراغ David and Goliath میرم و بعد ازون ریویو کامل راجب کتاب های گلدول مینویسم!121!In a work heavily influenced by the budding science of memetics (though he never once uses the word meme), Malcom Gladwell seeks to provide a framework for explaining why certain isolated phenomena (suicide in Micronesia, wearing hush puppies, reading a particular novel) can suddenly become widespread and why situations can suddenly swing from one extreme (rampant crime in 80s NYC) to another (the huge drop in crime in that same city during the 90s). Gladwell postulates three mechanisms of cultural epidemiology, the axioms of the law of the few, the stickiness factor and the power of context. The law of the few declares that change is often initiated by a small group of people (three different types) with an ever-widening pyramid of influence. Making up the first type are the connectors, basically human nexuses whose webs of important acquaintances (note that these are not friends) spread out in logarithmic vertigos of extension (e.g., Revere’s “the British are coming” spread more quickly than that of William Dawes because of the many people Revere knew in the towns he visited). Another group mentioned in the law of the few are mavens, whom we could term data strategists, their almost hobby-like information-gathering not just carried out to further their own interests, but to assist a broader sphere of people. The final set of individuals counted among the few are the salesmen, persuasive communicators whose instinctual ability to adapt the non-verbal cues of others and infect them with emotion is key to effecting wide-sweeping change. The second axiom in Gladwell’s informal theory is stickiness: the impact of the vector on the host, i.e., an idea or product must be memorable in order to spread; otherwise, it will not be embraced by the people in the connector's network. As a result, marketers must constantly devise ways to present products so that they are memorable. Of course, there is no ready-made science of what makes something catchy. However, the effectiveness of a product or idea’s packaging can be tested and tweaked, as Gladwell demonstrates in his discussion of how the creators of Sesame Street and Blue’s Clues try to ensure that children remember their message (in other words, learn the concept being taught). The final factor leading toward the tipping point is the power of context. This area is less well defined by Gladwell, and he unfortunately seems to be trying to herd together a host of disparate considerations under a single, handy rubric. The basic concept is that human behavior is strongly influenced by external variables of context. For example, ""zero tolerance"" efforts to combat minor crimes such as fare-beating and vandalism on the New York subway led to a decline in more violent crimes; the perception of increased vigilance altered the behavior and attitudes of the passengers. This theory of broken windows is well-known in sociology: attention to small details, reparation of seemingly unimportant (when looking at the big picture) problems, can engender massive change in a larger system (this is sort of the butterfly effect of sociology). On the whole, however, Gladwell has made an admirable foray into the construction of a theoretical model of memetic transmission and epidemiology. Building upon his layman’s approach, scientists specializing in cultural transmission might now begin testing his specific claims with an eye toward developing such a model.!121!This was a reread for me (15 years later) and it was interesting how my perspective on the information shifted somewhat. I didn't love the chapter about Goetz and NYC because I felt only certain factors were looked at in assessing the why's of what happened and the later clean up by the police. I felt only the factor of increased policing was looked at for the change in crime and not other farther reaching factors such as poverty, programs, and investments into communities. However the rest of the book stood about the same. Still a great read and food for thought!!121!Malcolm Gladwell has written five books, all of which have been on the New York Times bestseller list. He is extremely readable.This now-famous book is about popular ideas and products, and how they spread through society. Starting off small at first, they slowly gather momentum until they reach a 'tipping point', where they take off and become fantastically popular. This book is all about the mechanics of how this happens, and the different types of people and businesses enabling the process.The best bits for me? The illustration of how we are all incredibly different - how some people are freakishly sociable, others are freakishly knowing, informative and knowledgeable, whilst others have the charisma to sell you anything. Given Gladwell's clear examples I was easily able to slot a couple of my friends into these categories, and therefore relate to the ideas he was describing. These are the movers and shakers - the people who make things happen.He uses a wide range of phenomena to illustrate the idea of social epidemics - the rise to popularity of Hush Puppy shoes, a sudden decline of crime in New York, the success of the children's programmes Sesame Street and Blue Clues, the cleaning up of the New York subway, the spread of new corn seed in Iowa in the 1930s, an increase of suicides in the South Pacific islands of Micronesia, plus the reasons why smoking has drastically increased amongst teenagers in the US, despite strenuous efforts to discourage it. I was impressed by the wide range of his examples.My one criticism is that it was all rather predictable. The relationship between causes and effects were often ones I had heard before, or that I had worked out for myself. Unlike the book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything I didn't feel that I was being exposed to some really original ideas behind society's statistics.Still - an interesting read by an excellent writer. It clarified several concepts I already had, and made them a lot less woolly.!121!Holy suppositions, Gladwell! There's a whole lotta coulds, may haves, apparentlies, perhapses up in here!Malcolm Gladwell's basic premise in The Tipping Point: To explain how word-of-mouth is spread.A couple of the examples he used were how crime was reduced in NYC under Giuliani's reign and how an old, dead-in-the-water brand of shoes seemingly suddenly were selling like hotcakes. But honestly, my favorite bit was the section on Sesame Street.It's interesting stuff, no doubt with some truth to it, hell maybe even all of it, but it seemed like every hypothesis put forth was followed by misrepresentation of studies. Scientists were quoted as saying that possibly their study pointed towards such-and-such a conclusion, and then Gladwell took it and ran with it. That's not the case through out the book, but even if it only happens once, it casts doubt on the whole freaking thing. There were times I hated this and times I actually enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, more than I wanted to. For you see, this is the sort of thing feasted upon by ladder-climbing, power-lunchers, who want to put Gladwell's theories into practice for the purposes of creating their own wildfire word-of-mouth epidemic in the exalted name of the great and almighty greenback. That sort of greed, rising above the heads of most of humanity to serve the bloodsucking desires of one, is repellent. I guess I'm one of the few who didn't read this about 10 years or more back. I resisted for a while, but succumbed to peer pressure and misrepresentation of the book's content. Regardless, here I am. I've read it and probably you have too. So I ask you, is this shit or is it genius? After all, this stupid little book managed to put its theories into practice and the damn thing blew up like nobody's business.!121!موضوع: نقطه اوج، چه طور مسائل جزئی موجب تغییرات بزرگ می شوندخلاصه ای از محتویات: به طور کلی مالکوم گلدول، ژورنالیست مشهور نیویورکر در این کتاب علت وقوع اتفاقات اپیدمیک رو بررسی می کنه. اینکه تحت حضور چه شرایط و عواملی یک تبلیغ، یک شایعه، یا یک رویه در جامعه مد واپیدمیک می شه. از اطلاعاتی که در کتاب هست می شه در بحث های مارکتینگ و بازریابی، تبلیغات موثر استفاده کرد.خلاصه ای از جالبات کتاب:1. six degrees of separation: یکی از مطلب های جالبی که توی کتاب یاد گرفتم مفهوم شش درجه جدایی هست. به طول خلاصه طبق این تئوری، هر چیز یا شخصی که در دنیا وجود داشته باشه، با یک واسطه شش نفره از ذنجیره دوستان ما، و دوستان آن ها در دست رس ما خواهد بود. 2. Connectors: یکی از عوامل اپیدمیک شدن یک موضوع وجود افرادی با هویت رابط هست. این ها افرادی هستن با شبکه ای بزرگ از ارتباطات میان فردی. افرادی اجتماعی و خوش مشرب که معمولا مورد اعتماد و تحسین دوستانشون هستن. یک مثال خیلی جالب در خصوص این افراد این بود که می گه یک لیست 40 نفری از دوستانتون تهیه کنید و مشخص کنید چه طور با هر یک از این دوستانتون آشنا شدین، در نهایت به یک عدد کوچک می رسید. به این معنی که یکی یا دو نفر از دوستانتون موجب آشنا شدن شما با ما بقی افراد موجود در لیست دوسانتون هستن. این افراد همون اشخاص با هویت رابط هستند.3.  بر خلاف باور عموم مبنی بر اینکه انتخاب دوستانشون بر اساس ویژگی های مشترک هست، مطالعات و بررسی ها نشون می ده که ما دوستانمون رو بر اساس نزدیکی محیطی و اجتماعی انتخاب می کنیم. کسانی که فعالیت های مشترکی با اون ها داریم و نه ویژگی های مشترک. We're friends with the people we do things with, as much as we are with the people we resemble. We don't seek out friends, in other words. We associ­ate with the people who occupy the same small, physical spaces that we do.4.  Six degrees of separation doesn't mean that everyone is linked to everyone else in just six steps. It means that a very small number of people are linked to everyone else in a few steps, and the rest of us are linked to the world through those special few.5.  یکی دیگه از مطالبی که یاد گرفتم این بود که این دسته افرادی که با هویت رابط می شناسیم و دایره دوستان زیادی دارن آدم هایی هستن که ناخودآگاه معتقند که همه آدم هایی که قراره ببینن به یک نحوی فوق العاده و شگفت انگیزن و این طرز فکر باعث می شه زیبایی های آدم ها رو در حالی که از دید بقیه پنهان هست ببینن... جای بسی تامل داره این موضوع...6.  یک موضوع کاربردی و بسیار جالب دیگه در خصوص پیدا کردن شغل این هست که طبق آمار، اغلب افرادی که مشغول به کارهای رده بالا و خوب می شن اغلب شغلشون رو از طریق آشنایانشون (چه خیلی دور و چه خیلی نزدیک) پیدا می کنن که این مسئله اهمیت داشتن شبکه دوستان بزرگ رو مشخص می کنه. The strength of weak ties... Acquaintances, in short, represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more power­ful you are.7.  The more close an idea a message come to a connector, the more probability that it spreads.8. Mavens: Those people who hoard knowledge if particular subjects and present them to anyone need that type of information merely out of goodwill which in turns make them popular and trustworthy.9. The broken window theory  این نظریه بسیار جالب می گه اگر یک پنجره ای شکسته بشه و تعمییر نشه، باعث می شه که به مرور پنجره های بیشتری شکسته بشن و این آغازی می شه برای گسترش بی نظمی و جرم. وجود کوچکترین نشانه از آلودگی یا بی نظمی و بی توجهی به اون باعث گسترش اون می شه. crime is the inevitable result of disorder. If a window is broken and left unrepaired, people walking by will conclude that no one cares and no one is in charge. Soon, more windows will be broken, and the sense of anarchy will spread from the building to the street on which it faces, sending a signalthat anything goes. 10.  the convictions of your heart and the actual contents of your thoughts are less important, in the end, in guiding your actions than the immediate context of your behavior11.  Peer influence and community influence are more important than family influence in determining how children turn out 12.  Caring about someone deeply is exhausting thus limiting us on the number of people we can mentally afford to heartily and truly care about.13. Transactive memory:  حافظه انتقالی به این معنی هست که ما مواردی در زندگیمون داریم مثل شماره تلفن، آدرس، یا مجموعه مواردی که باید بهشون رسیدگی کنیم که این ها رو در حافظه خودمون حفظ نمی کنیم، بلکه در جایی ذخیرشون می کنیم و آن جا را که نگهدارنده اون موارد هست به خاطر می سپاریم.مثلا مسائل زیادی هستن مثل یک تجربه یا یک نوع بازی یا محاوره که حفظ و نگهداریشون رو بر عهده شریک زندگیمون می سپاریم. به همین خاطر طلاق یا جدایی انقدر دردناک می شن، به این دلیل که دیگه به بخشی از اون خاطرات دست رسی نمی توانیم داشته باشیم. کلام آخر:  یک ستاره ای که کم شد از امتیازش به دلیل حجیم بودن کتاب بود که می تونست خیلی خلاصه تر باشه. البته این مورد بین اغلب کتاب ها مشترک هست که دلیلش مسائل اقتصادی و مالی هست بیشتر. اما در کل کتاب واقعا خواندنی و آموزنده ای بود، و از مطالعش لذت بردم.!121!تجربة قراءة كتاب اللغة الإنجليزية هي تجربة رائعة جداً,تفتقد شعورك تجاه لغتك الأم تجاه لغة الضاد..ولكن لا يعني ذلك أنك تؤثرها على الإنجليزية,عندما يفتح لك باب القراءة بلغة أخرى إنما هي نعمة أنعم الله بها عليك فلا فضل لك ولا قوة فـ لله الحمد والشكر أولاً وأخيراً. الكتاب نقطة التحول عندما بدأت في قراءة لم أكن أستطيع تصنيف الكتاب بأي قسم أضعه وتحت أي مجموعة أصنفة فما كان مني إلا أن أنتهيت من الكتاب وقلت في نفسي هذا كتاب قد يكون تسويقي وقد يكون جزء من علم النفس. الكتاب يدور حول ثلاث فصول مهمة:فصل قانون القلة.وهو كيف أن قلة من الناس هي التي تقوم بنشر ""الأمراض""كما يسميها قلادويل وماهي الأمراض هي كلمة تخرج من الفم ويحدد ذلك بثلاث شروط أساسية وهم (المتواصلون-الذين يعرفون كل شيء - والمسوقيّن-)فـ بهؤلاءِ تكون الأفكار والأمراض تنتشر ويقول أنها تنطبق على جميع الحالات الإنسانية وقد لا تكون كذلك.وبعد ذلك هو فصل قوة اللزوجة وليس معناها الحرفي ولكن ""الإلتصاق"" المعلومة أو الخبر أو حتى الإعلان في رأس المتلقي وأخيراً هو فصل""قوة السياق"" وأن بعض الحوادث والأحداث تكون قوية نتيجة سياقها وتكون ضعيفة نتيجة السياق أو الحالة التي وجدت فيها.الكتاب يحتاج تركيز أكثر.جميل بـ مجملة وأفكارة ولكن كثرة الأمثلة كما هي عادت الأجانب فهم يعشقون شيء أسمه""الإحصائيات والأمثلة""لكي يعزز فكرته بكل صغيرة وكبيرة يذكرها.ولم أكن معتاد على هذا النوع من الكتب فكان صعباً أن أهضمة داماً قرأته في تاريخ ١٢-١٠ وإنتهيت منه في تاريخ ٣-١١.!121!احب قراءة مثل هذه الكتب فهي تجعل الإنسان يلتفت لأشياء لم تكن تثير اهتمامه من قبل، ويفسر الأمور بشكل مختلف، وتتغير نظرته كثيرا حتى في حياته العادية.كيف يمكن لسلوك اجتماعي، أو فكرة معينة، أن تنتشر في فترة زمنية قصيرة فجأة ومن دون سابق إنذار لتتحول إلى عدوى.هل يحتاج الامر إلى جهود مضنية ام أنه يعتمد على بعض العوامل التي قد تبدو بسيطة في ظاهر الأمر. يحاول الكتاب تفسير هذا الأمر بأسلوب مشوق يعتمد على الكثير من الأمثلة الجذابة والدراسات النفسية والاجتماعية. القواعد الثلاث لنقطة التحولقانون الأقليةعامل الالتصاققوة السياق يقول قانون الأقلية إن هناك عاملا أساسيا في الأوبئة وهو طبيعة باعث الرسالة فانتشار الوباء يعتمد على وجود اشخاص ذوي صفات معينة؛الموصلون: الذين يعرفون الكثير من الأشخاص.اصحاب الخبرة: من يعرفون الكثير من المعلومات ويريدون نقلها إلى غيرهم.البائعون: من يمتلكون مهارات الاقناع. عامل الالتصاق:ان تكون الرسالة نفسها تعلق بالذهن. قوة السياق:يمكن لعدد من التغيرات البسيطة نسبيا أن تؤثر بشدة على طريقة تصرفنا وكينونتنا.هناك اوضاع معينة تستطيع الطغيان على ميولنا الفطرية، والأساس هو الظرف او السياق الذي يحيط بالأمر.!121!Malcolm Gladwell shows us with this book that he is a jack-of-all-trades (or intellectual disciplines) and master of none. He very loosely weaves together existing social science and economic research to support his thin idea that there is a ""tipping point"" in all epidemics. While it was a page turner and interesting to read, his glib conclusory statements interpreting others' research was a bit jarring... For example, use of the word ""always"" when describing a social phenomenon is not a practice to which most trained social scientists would subscribe. I was also hoping for more practical advice resulting from his work, but not much was to be found other than that many complex forces (people, context, etc.) are at work in achieving a tipping point in most epidemics.!121!To understand ""The Tipping Point,"" one must understand what led to its creation: In 2000, there were 5.5 billion people living on the planet Earth. Many of them were considered human beings, but a few were thought to be celery. The difference between the two categories bewildered the top dog breeders of the day. To help us think more deeply about the consequences of the problem, consider the following fact: If you were born after 1975 and tried to ride a bicycle from Iceland to Darfur, the chances of crashing your bike into a British nanny increased 13% based on the number of Blossom reruns you watched as a child. Whether or not your parents are divorced is immaterial, as is the amount of padding in your seat. Social Scientists had a term for this late 20th century phenomenon: ""Whoa!"" Meanwhile, in Canada (if that's your real name), a young, mild-mannered boy named Malcolm recognized the unique power of combining individual letters into meaning-units called “words.” He quit his job making ice sculptures out of rusted fenders and moved south of the border to America (the nation, not the ice-cream stand). His timing was impeccable. At the end of the 90s, America had just entered a period of reckless behavior wherein, with little prompting, Americans would try to arrange words into ""sentences"" and, if sufficiently coked-up, slap those sentences into ""paragraphs."" Conservatives like Pat Buchanan were furious. Senator Bob Dole went on Meet the Press and blamed his erectile dysfunction on syntax. The era ended suddenly on December 31st, 1999, when, according to a budding bow-tie fanatic named Bill Nye, both the year AND the century had run their course. Feeling threatened, Gladwell went on national television to declare ""writing"" is the radical, counterintuitive explanation for the existence of what he called ""books"" but what conservatives called ""syphilis"". The strategy worked: He signed a contract with the biggest publishing house in America, which then promptly issued his first minor masterpiece: ""Writing: How Letters, Sentences, Paragraphs, and Chapters Add Up To The Thing That Came Before the Colon."" From that point on, it was all gin and roses (until Slash and Hypen left the band).!121!1 Start - Horrible book.Yes, yes, even though I started this yesterday I did actually finish it. And after doing so, I regret reading this. Full disclosure, the subject matter didn't really interest me but I've been wrong before so I gave it a go. I'll never be able to get back those precious reading hours.There are two things that make this book, in my opinion, unreadable. The first is that the concept/central theme of this book is nothing new. Now, I know this was published ca. 2000 so I'm about 17 years late to the party but come on. I can't imagine how this book struck a chord with so many people. The idea that there is some sort of tipping point (clever) that causes certain trends, ideas, etc. to become phenomenon's. To me that seems logical and a no-brainer. I mean, duh. There are certain elements that cause certain things to catch on while others don't. I just wasn't impressed with the author's fervor and excitement in trying to explain a logical thing. I felt as if he was talking down to the reader.The second thing that made me despise this book was that the author leaves a lot of half-thoughts. He rarely finishes an idea all the way to the end and the book is full of cases that are unfinished. He leaves one example before he's fully explained how it relates to his thesis and begins on another. I found it irritating and a bad way to write a book.I have Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by the same author and while I'll probably read it, I need to cool down from this one before I can jump into another one of his (what I presume will be horribly done) books.Do not read.!121!It has a number of eye openers and will broaden one’s vision to see how little things matter so much.A combination of lucid explanation with vivid (and often funny) real-world examples, the book sets out to explain nothing less than why human beings behave the way they do.!121!Inductive reasoning but still believable for the most part. Extreme fun to read.!121!“A book, I was taught long ago in English class, is a living and breathing document that grows richer with each new reading.”Tipping Point is a fascinating book. I enjoyed listening to Malcolm Gladwell narrate the audiobook and provide fascinating insights about social epidemics etc.One of the easiest five stars I've ever given.!121!The tipping point', an analysis of that magic moment when ideas, trends, social behaviours etc. tips over, and spread like nobody business sometimes into becoming mainstream. An interesting theory… I liked the examples and note that this much more than just a book of examples. To me, I liked the breaking down of how something started and grew to something more from the likes of Sesame Street and rumours through to sneakers and New York crime! The magic number 150 chapter is thought provoking, although to be clear Gladwell was far from the first to identify essentially the maximum number of acquaintances one can have. Recommended read, just to be aware of the trend examples provided. 7 out of 12, up to 9 out of 12 after my 2016 reread!!121!This is Gladwell's most thorough book. It has everything that I wanted from Outliers and Blink: research, diagnosis, and a clear call to action. Although admittedly, the research is not quite as fun as it is in his two following books. If I had Gladwell's attention, I would ask him this: How do you capitalize on your role as either a Connector, Maven, or Salesmen? And what if you are none of the above, but rather a part of the phenomenon-following mob? Can you aspire to a different role than the one you are naturally gifted with? I identified with the Maven, as I'm sure most journalists do. So what do I do with that beyond disseminating news and culture? Can a Maven be a trend setter or a Connector? Since I don't have Gladwell's attention, I guess that is rhetorical.One thing I love about Gladwell is that he presents strong theory and analysis in a way that allows for variance. One of my favorite quotes from this book: ""That's why social change is so volatile and so often inexplicable, because it is the nature of all of us to be volatile and inexplicable.""!121!من مدونتي: ثمانون كتابا بحثا عن مخرجhttps://saudomar.wordpress.com***طوال تاريخ الشرق الأ��سط الحديث لم تشهد المنطقة أي ثورة حقيقية, لم يكن هناك سوى مظاهرات نادرة مبعثرة هنا وهناك. وفجاءة, ومن دون سابق إنذار, تندلع الثورات الواحدة تلو الأخرى في أرجاء المنطقة .. تونس .. مصر .. اليمن .. البحرين .. ليبيا .. المغرب .. والقادم مذهل أكثر.ليس من الصعوبة بمكان أن نحلل سبب نشوء كل ثورة من هذه الثورات على حدة, لكن الشيء الذي يستعصي على الفهم هو سبب حدوث كل هذه الثورات في هذه الفترة القصيرة ( حوالي خمسين يوماً ). ما لذي دفع بعجلة الثورة لأن تتدحرج بهذه السرعة الرهيبة من دولة لأخرى؟ هذا السؤال, في وجهة نظري, جوهري جداَ, ويستحق التأمل والتفكير مطولاً. إذا عرفنا السر, ما لذي يمنعنا من إعادة استخدام الوصفة لإستحداث ثورات جديدة على امتداد الوطن العربي؟ إن الشعوب العربية التي انقلبت على انظمتها السياسية المستبدة ما يزال أمامها طريق طويل, وما تزال بحاجة لأن تقوم بثورات أخرى لإصلاح التعليم, لإصلاح القضاء, لإصلاح القطاع الصحي, لإصلاح القيم الاجتماعية البالية, وغيرها, كي تصل للمكانة التي تبغيها لنفسها. يوم من الأيام, بعد أن تهدأ الثورات في الوطن العربي, سوف تجد الشعوب العربية نفسها أمام تحديات جديدة تستلزم تغييرات جذرية, وحينها سوف يكون السؤال الذي يتداوله الجميع: كيف نفعلها مرة ثانية؟كتاب ( نقطة التحول ) للكاتب الكندي ( مالكوم غلادويل ) كتاب بعيد كل البعد عن المجال السياسي, لكنه يقدم ثلاث قوانين لتفسير التغيرات التي تنتشر في أي مجتمع بشكل مفاجئ وسريع. هذه القوانين مرنة جداً, تستطيع استخدامها كي تحلل سبب انتشار الثورات العربية, كما تستطيع أن تستعملها لتفسير نجاح تقنيات معينة مثل الآي باد وفشل تقنيات أخرى مثل قوقل ويف, تستطيع استخدامها لفهم أسباب انخفاض أو ارتفاع معدلات الجريمة, تحليل نجاح الكتب والروايات الأكثر مبيعاً, شيوع موضة معينة, بل إنك تستطيع أن تستخدمها لفهم سبب الإقبال غير العادي للشعب السعودي على شراب ( الفيمتو ) في رمضان.قبل أن نستعرض هذه القوانين الثلاثة, لنبدء بسؤال يطرح نفسه حول عنوان الكتاب: ( ما هي نقطة التحول؟ ) أي تغيير يحدث في المجتمع يحدث عادة بشكل تدريجي وعلى فترة طويلة من الزمن. على سبيل المثال, في فترة ليست بعيدة في السعودية كان منظر الشخص الذي يربط حزام الأمان مثير للاستغراب ( وربما للضحك أحياناً ), وإن لم تخني الذاكرة بدأت الجهود تتركز على التوعية بحزام الأمان في عام 2000, ومنذ ذلك الحين ونحن نشهد زيادة طفيفة سنوياً في أعداد من يلتزمون بربط حزام الأمان. هذا هو التحول الطبيعي؛ تحول يحدث بشكل تدريجي وعلى فترة طويلة من الزمن. لكن من جهة أخرى, هناك تحولات اجتماعية تحدث في غضون فترة قصيرة جداً, وبشكل غير متوقع, مثل الثورات العربية الراهنة. لحظة الغليان التي تنقلب فيها الأمور رأساً على عقب فجاءة ومن دون أي سابق أنذار لتنتشر ظاهرة أو سلوك غير متوقع في المجتمع انتشار النار في الهشيم, هي اللحظة التي يسميها مالكوم غلادويل ( نقطة التحول ).مصطلح نقطة التحول ( The Tipping Point ) هو أساساً مصطلح يستخدمه علماء الأوبئة لوصف اللحظة الحرجة التي ينفجر فيها الوباء بشكل شنيع في المجتمع. عندما كان غلادويل يعمل كمراسل لصالح ( واشنطن بوست ) أسندت له مهمة تغطية انتشار وباء الإيدز, ومع احتكاكه بعلماء الأوبئة بدأ يذهل من الطريقة الغير مألوفه, والمخيفه, والتي يصعب التنبؤ بها لإنتشار الأوبئة. في عام 1982 حدثت نقطة تحول شنيعة لوباء الأيدز, فقد انتقل من كونه وباء يعاني منه أفراد قلة, لكونه وباء عالمي. هذه الحادثة, وهذا الوصف لها, جعل غلادويل يطرح فكرة أن لكل شيء, وليس فقط الأوبئة, نقطة تحول. ما لذي يمنع, تساءل غلادويل, من أن يكون للأعمال التجارية, الموضة, الأفكار, التيارات, المنتجات, الإعلانات, نقطة تحول أيضاً؟الفكرة الأساسية التي يبني عليها غلادويل قوانينه الثلاثة لحدوث ( نقطة التحول ) هي في أن نتصور أفكار وسلوكيات المجتمع كأوبئة, ومثل الأوبئة, هذه الأفكار والسلوكيات لها خاصية الانتقال والعدوى. لذلك, يسمي غلادويل قوانينه ( القوانين الثلاثة للأوبئة ). دعونا الآن نتسعرض هذه القوانين.القانون الأول لإنتقال الفكرة أو السلوك في المجتمع اسمه ( قانون الأقلية ). ينص القانون الأول أن هناك أشخاص قليلون جداً في المجتمع بإمكانهم نقل العدوى ( الفكرة أو السلوك أو الرسالة ) أفضل من غيرهم. هناك ثلاث ملكات اجتماعية اذا امتلكها الشخص صار موصلاً فعالاً للعدوى, وهي: القدرة على الاقناع, القدرة على تكوين صلات اجتماعية, والقدرة على جمع المعلومات.القانون الثاني هو ( قانون عامل الإلتصاق ): محتوى الرسالة وطريقة عرضها تلعب دوراً أساسياً في انتشارها. من السهولة إيصال رسالتك للجماهير, لكن كيف تجعلهم يتذكرونها؟ كيف تجعلها ترسخ في أذهانهم؟ كيف تجعلهم يؤمنون بها؟ هذا هو التحدي الحقيقي, وهذا هو لب القانون الثاني.القانون الثالث هو ( قانون قوة السياق ): ينص على أن الظروف والأحوال المحيطة بالعدوى تلعب دوراً مهماً في انتشارها. حتى نستطيع أن نتصور كيف تعمل هذه القوانين الثلاثه, من الأفضل أن نربطها بالشكل التالي: القانون الأول هو قانون عن الشخص الذي ينقل الرسالة ( العدوى ) والقانون الثاني عن الرسالة نفسها, والقانون الثالث عن الظروف المحيطة بها.باستخدام هذه القوانين الثلاث�� تستطيع أن تعيد النظر لتحلل الأفكار, والسلوكيات, والرسائل الذائعة في المجتمع لتفهم سبب ذيوعها, بل إنك تستطيع أن تستخدمها عن عمد لنشر أفكار معينة. في الطبعات اللاحقة من الكتاب, قام غلادويل بإلحاق فصل في أخر الكتاب اسمه ( دروس من العالم الحقيقي ) في هذا الفصل نشر غلادويل بعض محاولات القراء لتنفيذ نقاط تحول في بيئتهم ومجال أعمالهم.حقيقة أني, وبكل صراحة, أعتبر نفسي قد ظلمت كتاب ( نقطة التحول ) أشد الظلم حتى الآن. غلادويل ينال على المحاضرة الواحدة التي يلقيها أربعين ألف دولار, وقد باع من هذا الكتاب أكثر من مليونين نسخة حتى عام 2006, قبل أن تعود مبيعات للترتفع مرة أخرى بعض صدور كتابه التالي. صدقني, هذا الانتشار الغير عادي لم يكن لأن الناس تريد ان تعرف سبب انتشار السلوكيات والأفكار في المجتمع ( رغم أن هذا شيء مثير ) .. هناك أسباب مغايرة لشعبية غلادويل الجارفة.أسلوب غلادويل في الكتابة هو أسلوب من عالم أخر. غلادويل يؤسس فكرة الكتاب في البداية, ثم ينطلق بعد ذلك بسرد قصص قصيرة وأبحاث علمية متتالية عن اشياء غير مترابطة إطلاقاً ( في أحد الفصول تجده يتحدث عن برنامج الأطفال الشهير شارع السمسم والفصل التالي تجده يتحدث عن الثورة الأمريكية ) لكنك تجده في النهاية, وبشكل مدهش وعاصف للعقل, يجر حبلاً سحريا من مكان مجهول لتترابط كل هذه القصص لتدعم وتؤكد فكرة الكتاب الأساسية. إن أسلوبه في السرد لهو إعجازي بكل معنى الكلمة. إن كل من وجّه إنتقادات حاده لكتبه (بمن فيهم العالم والمؤلف الشهير ستيفن بانكر) لم يستطع ألا أن يعلن إنبهاره بهذا الأسلوب الساحر في الكتابة.إنني أتحداك الأن أن تفتح هذا الكتاب ( أو أي كتاب أخر له ) وأن تشير لسطر واحد ( فقط سطر واحد ) وتقول هذا سطر ممل. هذا الرجل باستطاعته ان يجعلك أن تنهي كتابه في جلسة واحدة من دون أن تشعر بوجودك. في الكوميديا هناك ما يعرف بسطر الخبطة (Punch Line) وهو عبارة عن الجملة التي تأتي في نهاية النكتة أو القصة كي تفاجأ الجمهور وتضحكهم ( وكأنها خبطة على رؤسهم ). كل قصة من قصص غلادويل تنتهي بسطر خبطة هستيري على رؤوس القراء؛ إما تحليل أو استنتاج أو إعادة تشكيل للقصة أو إبراز لعنصر خفي يتم بطريقة لا استطيع ان اصفها الا بأنها طريقة ( غلادويلية ). حتى لو كنت تعرف القصة التي يقصها, سوف تتفاجئ بانها يعيد صياغتها بشكل درامي ليجعل منها ملحمة تنتهي بنهاية واستنتاج غير قابل للتوقع ولو بعد مئة عام.كتب غلادويل تستعصي حتى على التصنيف, في كل مره ازور مكتبة جديدة أجد تصنيف جديد لكتب غلادويل. أحيانا أجدها في قسم (الأعمال) وأحيانا في (علم النفس) واحياناً في (تطوير الذات). بالنسبة لي, أفضل تصنيف وجدته لكتب غلادويل هو, كما يقترح هو نفسه في موقعه, مغامرات فكرية. كتبه تتحدى الحكمة التقليدية, وتفتش في الخفايا والدقائق الماكرة, وتعتبر كل شيء ( موضة, برامج اطفال, رياضة, أبحاث علمية, جرائم .. كل شيء ) مادة خصبة للتفكير والتأمل والكتابة, تعالج القضايا بطريقة جريئة جداً, بل إنها تتطرق لقضايا غير مألوفة.غلادويل هو من أصل كندي, ولد في إنجلترا عام 1963, ويعيش حاليا في نيويورك, ويكتب منذ عام 1996 في مجلة نيويوركر. نشئت فكرة الكتاب في البداية كمقال قدمه للمجلة, والذي تم على أثره قبوله ككاتب فيها. استلم مبلغ مليون دولار مقدما لنشر كتابه, وتم نشره في عام 2000, لكن مبيعات الكتاب فاقت أشد توقعات غلادويل جموحاً, وربما وجد بعض العزاء لاحقاً في الطلب الساحق عليه لإلقاء محاضرات نظير مبالغ ضخمه. من المثير للإنتباه ان هذا الكتاب أدخل الكثير من المفردات للغة الإنجليزية وجعلها مفردات متداولة حتى بين من لم يقراءه, مثل: The Tipping Point, The Law of The Few, Mavens وغيرها.في عام 2005 ضمت مجلة التايم غلادويل ضمن قائمة أكثر 100 شخص تأثير, وفي عام 2006 قدم محاضرة رائعة في مؤتمر تيد بعنوان ( صلصة السباغيتي ), وفي عام 2007 نال جائزة من من منظمة علم الاجتماع الأمريكية للتميز في تقديم القضايا الإجتماعية, وفي نفس العام نال درجة شرفية من جامعة واترلو.الترجمة العربية للكتاب صدرت من ( الدار العربية للعلوم ) وتقييمي لها بأنها ترجمة ( قابلة للقراءة ) لكن هناك ( كالعادة ) أخطاء في الترجمة لا يقع فيها طالب إعدادية تجعل من بعض السطور مربكة وصعبة الفهم. مشكلة الترجمة في العالم العربي, في تصوري كقارئ, انها تتبع نظام ( ترجم وانشر ) من دون وجود أي مرحلة للتنقيح أو مراجعة الترجمة. على كل حال, بإمكانك فهم النص الأصلي من خلال الترجمة مع وجود حاجة لسد بعض الحفر والثغرات في الترجمة.تمنياتي لكم بقراءة ممتعة!121!هو ثالث كتاب أقرأه لغلادويل بعد آوتلايرز الذي أثار إعجابي جدا ، وبلنك الذي كان شبه محبط بالمقارنة . سعيد بأن أقول إن غلادويل قدم في ذا تيبينغ بوينت مادة بقوة كتاب آوتلايرز من ناحية قراءة وتحليل الواقع وقولبته في قوالب إستنتاجات تفيد أصحاب الأفكار سواءا تجارية أو هادفة أو مجتمعية أو غيرها في إحداث التغيير في المجتمع بأخذ العوامل التي يطرحها بعين الإعتبار.","['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Psychology',

In Cold Blood (Paperback),Truman Capote,4.09,655197,1959,"On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. In Cold Blood is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.","""How much money did you get from the Clutters?""""Between forty and fifty dollars.""

Paroled: 7-6-59.As I write this review, I'm sitting about 60 miles from the Clutter house in Holcomb, Kansas. Holcomb is a small, farming community located just west of Garden City. This is a place where everyone in the whole county not only knows your name, but also has a working knowledge of your family history going back fifty plus years. I usually avoid reading true crime books. I don't want my head filled with tragedy. I want to go about my life with a degree of caution, but not be ruled by the fear I feel such books will instill. I picked up a copy of this book at the Dodge City Library. The librarian at the check out desk, a woman about mid-sixties, slender, elegant, and still attractive ran her finger along the edge of the spine. I noticed a shiver had rolled up her back and rippled her shoulders. She looked up at me with pinched blue eyes and said in a whisper, ""I remember when this happened"". She watched her father put locks on the doors for the first time. The murders became a demarcation line in her life there was life before the Clutter murders, and then there was life after the Clutter murders. Her response surprised me. We live in a time when any crime anywhere in the country is broadcast out to the nation and something tragic that happens in Illinois or in Virginia or Alaska impacts our lives. I would have thought over time some of the significance of the Clutter murder would have been buried under the avalanche of murder and mayhem that the news cycle brings us 24/7. For this community and for all the small communities dotting the map of Kansas, and even in the surrounding states, this was something that wasn't supposed to happen in a small town. This was big city crime that happened in their own backyard. As I talked to people about the Clutter murders most everybody had some kind of physical reaction. They flinched as if they were dodging a blow or took a step back from me or developed a twitch along their jawline. Their eyes gazed through me or beyond me as the fears and anxieties of 1959 came flooding back into their mind. Most of them attributed more deaths to the crime, each of them citing six deaths rather than four. I'm sure they remembered that there was six family members, but two older girls had already left the home to start their own lives. They were not present on that fateful night when their family was murdered. In Cold Blood was required reading in many schools in this region clear up until about the 1970s, so even people who were too young to remember the crime have experienced the tragedy through Truman Capote. In the description above regarding Perry Edward Smith there is a reference to Phillips County. This has special significance for me because I was born and raised in Phillips County. The family farm is located in Phillips County. My Father and I graduated from Phillipsburg High School. My Dad was a sophomore in high school in 1955 when Perry Smith decided to burglarize the Chandler Sales Company in Phillipsburg, Kansas and this seemingly insignificant act was really the beginning of this story. Smith and his accomplice, also Smith, stole typewriters, adding machines etc and left town with their ill gotten goods in the backseat of the car. Later they ignored a traffic signal in St. Joseph, Missouri and were pulled over by a police officer. The cop was very interested in what was in their backseat. They were extradited back to Phillipsburg, where through an open window (imagine my embarrassment for the law enforcement of my home county) they escaped. Later Perry was caught again and sent back to Phillipsburg where the law enforcement fortunately did a much better job of keeping track of him. Perry Smith received 10 years in the Kansas Penitentiary in Leavenworth. Richard Eugene Hickock was already serving time in Leavenworth for fraud. The two met and became friends. The final piece to the puzzle that not only determined the fate of the Clutter family, but also the fates of Smith and Hickock was snapped down in place when they meet Floyd Wells. Wells, serving time for some bit of stupidity, had worked for Herb Clutter back in 1948. He told Hickock and Smith that Clutter was a wealthy farmer, and kept a safe full of cash in his house. Wells was absolutely full of shit. There was no safe. There was no pile of cash. There was absolutely no reason for four people to lose their lives for $40. 

After the murders they went to Mexico for a while, but even though they could live cheaply down South the money still trickled through their fingers. After they burned through the goods they had acquired through the Clutter robbery and through defrauding a series of retail stores, they found that working in Mexico didn't pay well either. They came back up to the United States and there was this baffling moment where Perry Smith is reading the paper and sees an article about a family that was tied up and shot to death. ""Amazing!"" Perry glanced through the article again. ""Know what I wouldn't be surprised? If this wasn't done by a lunatic. Some nut that read about what happened out in Kansas."" WTF? Some nut? How about the original coconut heads that murdered the family in Kansas? Perry does have a moment or two where he weighs what happened in Kansas. ""Know what I think?"" said Perry. ""I think there must be something wrong with us. To do what we did.""""Did what?""""Out there.""""Deal me out, baby,"" Dick said. ""I'm a normal.""Truman Capote had been looking for the right story for an experimental form of writing he'd been considering trying. He wanted to blend fiction and nonfiction. The Clutter murders struck him as the perfect story to launch this new form of writing. I have to admire his fortitude, for a man of his sensibilities not only spending that much time among farmbillies, but having to befriend them as well. It must have been somewhat of a painful experience. 

Capote in the Clutter homeFloyd Wells eventually comes forward and tells what he knows about the murders. He had always liked Herb Clutter and felt ashamed that what he had told, in a moment of prison bonding, had led to such a vicious conclusion. Without his statement I'm pretty sure that Smith and Hickock would have gotten away with the murders. The slender evidence tying them to the murders would have made it almost impossible to prosecute them. Their sentencing can have only one conclusion...death. As they are being led back to their cells:Smith says to Hickock, ""No chicken-hearted jurors, they!"" They both laughed loudly, and a cameraman photographed them. The picture appeared in a Kansas paper above a caption entitled: ""The Last Laugh?""When I consider their bravado the last vestiges of any sympathy I may have been harboring for their plight dissipated. This is a beautifully written book. I want to thank Harper Lee for her role in helping Capote bring this book to completion. I'm not sure Capote would have had the perseverance to see it through without her holding his hand. I was surprised about how many connections I have to the events in this book many of which I had no idea until I read them in the book for the first time. I was long overdue to read this book and this experience has certainly convinced me to add more of the classic True Crime genre to my reading queue. This book is legendary not only because of the heinous nature of the crime, but also because Capote was ushering in a new way to tell a story. If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten!121!I just wonder why it took me so long to get this masterpiece on my currently-reading shelf. What a breathtaking story! And told in the most amazing novelistic style! The cold-blooded murders in Kansas in 1956 are described by a cold, distant narrator via the interviews of the family, acquaintances, and community around the victims and the hair-raising stories of Perry and Bobby, the murderers. It is a real page-turner - I couldn't put it down! The descriptions of the youth of all the tragic protagonists are explored from every angle under a magnifying glass. In Cold Blood kept me thinking that most of the recent murder mystery shows and movies were indebted to this piece of literature (that Capote probably deserved a Pulitzer for but was passed over, helas, in 1965). There is this strange homoeroticism between the two murderers (who call each other ""sugar"" and ""honey"") but who both spout homophobic words throughout. Like the lawyers, I felt Richard was the coldest one and Perry the most twisted and tragic. This book is a true masterpiece of the non-fiction novel (even if some of the facts brought out by Capote were disputed) and its narration is stupendous in character development and maintains an enormous amount of suspense end-to-end. It is even more astounding because the reader already knows who commits the crime, the novel only elucidates the ""why"" and even that is ambiguous and pathetic. An awesome read.Note that in A Capote Reader, there is a great short essay about the making of the movie In Cold Blood where Capote talks a bit about the 6 years it took him to write this masterpiece. (Haven't seen the movie yet :/)[UPDATE] I finally saw the movie Capote and it was absolutely amazing as a backstory to this book. I still haven't found the movie In Cold Blood yet.!121!This story made a huge impact on my life. There were six of us kids and come summer my mother couldn't handle all of us so she farmed me out every year to the aunts. One aunt lived in Indio. My mother put me on a Greyhound bus and nine years old; all alone with my brown paper grocery bag as luggage. I was scared to death. A Seagull hit the expansive windshield with splat of blood and feathers. Unfazed the driver merely turned on the windshield wipers and made and even bigger mess.I arrived in Indio a hundred plus degrees and my aunt Carol picked me up at the bus station. She said she was taking me and my cousin Danny to the movies. Oh, boy I loved the movies. We stopped at a store to pick up some candy and I bought my favorite Chicken-O-stick. I was nine my cousin was seven, she bought our tickets at The Aztec theater and ushered us through the door. She said she'd be back when the movie was over. It was nice to be out of the sweltering heat. We sat down ate our candy in great anticipation. The movie started and it was in black and white. It was In Cold Blood, not something a nine year old should be watching.Ten years later my cousin Danny and my Aunt Carol would be arrested for killing my favorite uncle Don in a murder for hire. My aunt hired a hit man out of Orange County named Cornelius. They stiffed in a fake call of an emergency at the Metropolitan Water Distinct where my uncle worked. There was a clause in the life insurance policy that if he died at work it was double indemnity. My uncle showed up in the middle of the night and they shot him in the back of the head. Of course there is lots more to this true story.And to this day I can not forget In Cold Blood, the movie.Sorry for the rant this was supposed to be a book review.David Putnam Author of the Bruno Johnson series.!121!An absolute masterpiece of True Crime literature, In Cold Blood is both gritty and intelligent.This should be on everyone's list of Books to Read in a Lifetime. Capote's writing in this account is absolutely flawless. As many of you may know, In Cold Blood is a true account of the heinous murders of the Clutter Family in 1959-Kansas. Through Capote's words, you are transported to this small town; you get alternating accounts from the family, the killers and from other individuals close to the crime. The description of the night of the actual murders is bone-chilling and can disturb sleep, believe me! This is my second time reading this book and I found it just as impactful during my reread. To me, it is interesting to think about Capote investigating and compiling his research for the novel. He actually went and lived in this town, along with one of his closest friends, Harper Lee, and they painstakingly interviewed hundreds of people associated with the events. Just the sheer amount of data collected and how it was intricately woven into a cohesive narrative astounds me.Yes, I know that is what nonfiction novelists do, but this was truly a ground-breaking piece of journalistic writing at the time and should be appreciated as such.Another interesting aspect of this is how focused Capote was in the psychology behind the killers' motivations and actions, as well as their complex relationship with one another both before and after the crimes. Ahead of his time in that regard, in my opinion.I think anyone who enjoys True Crime, Criminology, Psychology and even Sociology will find this book absolutely captivating. If you have been putting off reading this for any reason, please stop, pick it up, NOW!!!!121!Truman Capote - image from the NY Post This is one of the great ones. Capote blankets Holcomb, Kansas with his curiosity. The root of this work is a ghastly crime. Two recently released convicts, seeking a fortune that did not exist, invade the Clutter family home, tie up the four family members present and leave no witnesses. It takes some time for the perpetrators to be identified, then tracked down. Capote looks at how the townspeople react to this. Many, fearful that one of their own was responsible, become withdrawn. How do people mourn? He looks at the sequence of investigation that leads ultimately to the capture of the suspects, focusing on one of the chief investigators. He looks in depth at the criminals. What makes them tick? How could people do such awful things? In reading this I was reminded of some of the great panoramic art works of a bygone age, works by Bosch, or Breughel, in which entire towns were brought together into one wide-screen image. This is what Capote has done. But even with all the territory he covers there is considerable depth. I was also reminded, for an entirely different reason of Thomas Hardy. Capote has an incredible gift for language. He writes beautifully, offering descriptions that can bring to tears anyone who truly loves language. It has the power of poetry. This is truly a classic, a book that defined a new genre of literature. If you haven’t read it, you must.Murderers, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith - image from ABC AustraliaIn case you are in the market and in the neighborhood, this 10/24/19 item from SF Gate by Clare Trapasso, might be of interest - The Untold Story Behind the Infamous 'In Cold Blood' Murder House—and Why It's for Sale!121!“‘This is it, this is it, this has to be it, there’s the school, there’s the garage, now we turn south.’ To Perry [Smith], it seemed as though Dick [Hickock] were mumbling jubilant mumbo-jumbo. They left the highway, sped through a deserted Holcomb, and crossed the Santa Fe tracks. ‘The bank, that must be the bank, now we turn west – see the trees? This is it, this has to be it.’ The headlights disclosed a lane of Chinese elms; bundles of wind-blown thistle scurried across it. Dick doused the headlights, slowed down, and stopped until his eyes were adjusted to the moon-illuminated night. Presently, the car crept forward…”-	Truman Capote, In Cold BloodAmerican crime writing stretches all the way back to before the founding of the United States. If you want – I don’t necessarily recommend it – you can read Cotton Mather, and find him recounting the alleged criminal actions committed by his neighbors (some of which involves taking license with farm animals). Since then, there have been countless newspaper articles, magazine stories, and entire books aimed at fulfilling an insatiable appetite for understanding the felonious conduct of others. Despite the overwhelming number of entries in the true crime genre, however, you cannot have a conversation about it without mentioning one notorious book: Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. Billed by its creator as a new literary form, the “nonfiction novel,” this product of the New Journalism was not actually a first of its kind. That does not lessen its impact, or its artistry. In Cold Blood begins on the windswept plains of Kansas, outside the town of Holcomb (“The land is flat, and the views are extensive; horses, herds of cattle, a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples…”), and ends in a cemetery underneath the same big sky (“the graves…lie in a far corner of the cemetery – beyond the trees, out in the sun, almost at the wheat field’s bright edge...”). In terms of structure, pacing, dialogue, reveals, and fully-realized scenes, this reads as good as any fiction, and far better than most. That’s the problem, though. A lot of it is fiction. *** The story behind the making of In Cold Blood, which was the subject of two major motion pictures, at times threatens to subsume the underlying subject matter, like a snake eating its own tail. According to legend, Capote, a famed author and bon vivant, saw a small article in The New York Times about the murder of Herbert, Bonnie, Kenyon, and Nancy Clutter, members of a relatively well-off farming family. With his authorial senses tingling – nothing sells like murder in the heartland – Capote set off for Kansas with his buddy Nell Harper Lee. Once there, this odd couple essentially embedded themselves into the community, pumping them for information until the well ran dry. Later, once two suspects – Perry Smith and Richard Hickock – were in custody, Capote insinuated himself into their lives as well. When all was said and done, it became hard to know whether Capote was simply a fact finder, or an active participant, one whose unseen hand actually shaped the outcome of the case. *** Even with all its baggage, it is startling how much talent is on display here. This is a book that grips you, and insists that you keep reading. The prose is luminous, the characterizations acute, and the setting marvelously realized. Capote finds his arc, and he builds carefully around that, modulating the tension until his big payoff, before settling on as graceful an ending as you can imagine. There are moments of subdued ghastliness, such as Perry Smith’s confession:  [Alvin] Dewey’s ears ring with it – a ringing that almost deafens him to the whispery rush of Smith’s soft voice. But the voice plunges on, ejecting a fusillade of sounds and images: Hickock hunting the discharged shell; hurrying, hurrying, and Kenyon’s head in a circle of light, the murmur of muffled pleadings, then Hickock again scrambling after a used cartridge; Nancy’s room, Nancy listening to boots on hardwood stairs, the creak of the steps as they climb toward her, Nancy’s eyes, Nancy watching the flashlight’s shine seek the target (“She said, ‘Oh, no! Oh, please. No! No! No! No! Don’t! Oh, please don’t! Please!’ I gave the gun to Dick. I told him I’d done all I could do. He took aim, and she turned her face to the wall”); the dark hall, the assassins hastening toward the final door. Perhaps, having heard all she had, Bonnie welcomed their swift approach.There are also moments when Capote describes a place – a cheap hotel room in Mexico, or the gallows in Kansas – with such tactility that you can almost reach out and touch it. In Cold Blood lives so strongly in the memory because it indelibly implants these images into your head, as well as any movie. Towering over everything is Capote’s portrait of Perry Smith. In Cold Blood is not a whodunit. Rather, in large part, it is the character study of a killer. A cripple suffering from chronic pain in both legs – which had been crushed in a motorcycle accident – Smith grew up with an alcoholic mother who died when he was very young. He spent time in several orphanages, where he claimed to have been abused. In Capote’s compassionate hands, this victim-turned-victimizer becomes a tragically tortured figure, one so skillfully etched that his ultimately homicidal acts feel like an inevitability. Of course, part of the problem with In Cold Blood is this very thing. By lifting up Perry Smith, Capote casts a shadow over everyone else: his partner in crime, Hickock; the law enforcement agents who caught him; and most of all, the victims themselves. Still, if overemphasizing the killer was In Cold Blood’s only problem, it could be dismissed as a common failing of the true crime genre. After all, many (if not most) of these types of stories focus more on the criminal than the victim. Unfortunately, this is a dramatic imperative, since the criminal is the agent of action, while the victim is the passive recipient. As noted above, however, this is not the only issue with In Cold Blood. ***From the moment of its publication, In Cold Blood was trailed by accusations: Capote made up dialogue; Capote invented things; Capote was wrong with his interpretations. Some of these criticisms are off base, as they involve judgment calls or sour grapes. Obviously, people who came off looking bad cried foul, but that doesn’t mean that Capote was wrong. Other criticisms, though, are right on point. The creation of scenes whole cloth, for instance, particularly rankles. For example, the book’s ending – providing a beautiful counterpoint to the opening – is so perfect that it feels fortuitous. According to one of the men involved, it was too perfect, because it never happened.Perhaps more troubling is Capote’s absence in this story. Told objectively in the third-person – except for long portions of purportedly verbatim recollections from various participants – Capote does not place himself into events. On the one hand, this was nice. There is a trend in modern true crime for an author to insert him or herself into the chronicle, making their personal story equal to that being presented. This can work, if done right, such as in Michelle McNamara’s posthumously released I’ll Be Gone in the Dark. But it’s hard to do right. In my opinion, many efforts suffer from this intrusion, which can be annoyingly distracting, or used as filler to supplement otherwise meager facts. In Cold Blood is blessedly free of self-conscious handwringing about the ethics of crime-writing. There are no digressions into areas about which a reader could not care less. For all of Capote's legendary ego, there is no reflective navel-gazing. Above all else, there is the thrilling sense of watching things unfold as a witness. Yet Capote’s absence can be seen as an act of mendacity. According to some sources, he was pulling strings and moving pieces in order to shape the outcome. The extent of this can be debated. Nevertheless, I think it’s fair to say that In Cold Blood without Capote as a character cannot – for this reason alone – be considered the full story.In the end, the controversy cannot do much to knock In Cold Blood off its pedestal. While it may not be a great work of investigative journalism, it is undoubtedly a powerful piece of art.!121!In Cold Blood, Truman CapoteThis article is about the book by Truman Capote. In Cold Blood is a non-fiction novel by American author Truman Capote, first published in 1966; it details the 1959 murders of four members of the Herbert Clutter family in the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas. When Capote learned of the quadruple murder, before the killers were captured, he decided to travel to Kansas and write about the crime. He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee, and together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes. The killers, Richard ""Dick"" Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested six weeks after the murders and later executed by the state of Kansas. Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book. When finally published, In Cold Blood was an instant success, and today is the second-biggest-selling true crime book in publishing history, behind Vincent Bugliosi's 1974 book Helter Skelter about the Charles Manson murders.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «به خونسردی»؛ «به خونسردی - شرح واقعی قتل چهار نفر و پی آمدهای آن»؛ «در کمال خونسردی»؛ نویسنده: ترومن کاپوتی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هفدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 1998میلادیعنوان: به خونسردی؛ نویسنده: ترومن کاپوت؛ مترجم: باهره راسخ؛ تهران، فرانکلین، 1347، در 345ص، موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: به خونسردی - شرح واقعی قتل چهار نفر و پی آمدهای آن؛ نویسنده: ترومن کاپوتی؛ مترجم: پریوش شهامت؛ تهران، نشر پیکان، 1376، در 467ص؛ شابک 9646229123؛داستان برگرفته از خبری واقعی، از قتل‌عام یک خانواده، در «کانزاس» است، و همین رویداد به نویسنده فرصت می‌دهد، تا نخستین رمان ناداستان خویش را بنویسند؛ نویسنده زمان بسیاری را صرف گفتگو، با «شاهدان»، «دو قاتل»، و «بررسی گزارش پلیس»، می‌کنند؛ کتابشان در سال1965میلادی، با تیراژی میلیونی برایش نامداری، پیروزی و ثروت به همراه می‌آورد؛ با این کتاب به اوج می‌رسند، و نمی‌توانند هرگزی کتاب دیگری در همین اندازه بنویسند؛ زندگینامه نویسش «جرالد کلارک»، علت را زمان طولانی پژوهش، و خستگی ناشی از کار سنگین ایشان می‌داند؛ تاری بهنگام رسانی 27/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 22/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!At the beginning, In Cold Blood reads like a classic southern gothic tale. I've read about Harper Lee hanging out with Capote while he put this thing together, and at times it feels like she greatly influenced how it was written. You meet the Clutters who are just the nicest people in the world out working hard and going to school and being awesome people in the town. And, I know there's all this controversy over how the book is written since it adds fictional conversations and thoughts that Capote obviously couldn't have known, but everything is rooted in the nonfiction account of what happened, and I think it adds a deeper layer of connection to the family. I read Helter Skelter in high school, and I remember that book starting out right from the gate with all the details of the murders before diving into the Manson family and the trial. In Cold Blood works more in reverse and saves the details for later, and my God when I got there I didn't even want to read about what happened. It was all so senseless and random. I had a hard time finishing the book after that. I just wanted it to be over. Often beautifully and brilliantly written, sometimes tedious to get through, sometimes way too meticulous with details, sometimes spending a couple of pages discussing cats or a building or something, this book is a classic in the true crime genre. I haven't read a lot of true crime in my reading life, but I've read enough to know that this deserves a spot at the top of the list. Capote does an excellent job laying out the story, and gives the family, the murderers, and the cops an overwhelming amount of description and development. I knew more about the killers than I ever wanted to know, and I want things to go a different direction even though I knew they wouldn't. Now I have to watch the movie, then Capote, then Infamous. This is a story that will be stuck in my head for a while. It's a harsh reminder of the evil that exists in the world, and how fragile our existence on this planet really is. It's also a very detailed account of the senseless murder of most of a family, but I took away a lot of other stuff from its pages, too. Read it.!121!After I read it, I looked up pictures of the Clutter family, and just stared for about five minutes. They endured what is probably everyone’s worst fear.Having never heard anything of the Clutter murders prior to reading this book, the experience of reading it was intense, gripping, and suspenseful from beginning to end. Capote, with his impartial writing style, relayed facts and details in such a way as to give a complete character illustration of everyone involved: from each of the Clutters, to the investigators, lawyers, and even the murderers themselves. He did not reveal his personal sentiments or biases, or even presume to know right from wrong. In what he coined a “non-fiction novel,” Capote brilliantly combined the elements of a fictional murder novel with factual journalism and psychological analysis to show the moral dilemmas surrounding the act of murder.In the section about the Clutter family life during their final days before the murders, Capote’s description of their daily routines and habits made what was to come even more troubling. Nancy and Kenyon were going through the typical hardships of adolescence; Nancy had a boyfriend of whom her father did not approve and was the most popular girl in school, while Kenyon was self-conscious, nerdy, and socially awkward. Herbert and Bonnie’s marriage was a bit shaky; Bonnie had a mysterious and fleeting mental illness, and Herbert was very busy with his farming business and did not have much time to tend to her. However, despite their problems, they maintained a strong family bond, were well-liked by the entire community, and we get a sense that things were looking up for them.After the murder takes place, as if to intensify the suspense, Capote does not immediately reveal to us exactly how or why Perry and Dick committed the crime, but instead takes us on their journey as they attempt escape through the deep South while the investigators begin to try to solve the crime. We learn much about these two characters through their interactions with each other, letters, diary excerpts, and interviews with family members. We are brought deep into their psyche, learning everything from their personal hygiene habits to their mannerisms and quirks. In an uncomfortable yet brilliant way, Capote allows us to sympathize with the murderers, if only for a moment. What exactly went wrong with them? Did Perry Smith’s childhood of abuse, neglect, and displacement lead him to have moments of extreme callousness and violence? Dick, who had a seemingly normal childhood and a loving family, was in a car accident which left him with a permanent head injury. Was his head injury the cause of his downfall, or was it some other unknown character defect? Even though they were capable of evil and cold-heartedness, they also had goals and insecurities as well as the capacity for creativity, love, and fear. The murders were a tragic “psychological accident” (according to Alvin Dewey), the collision of two personalities gone terribly wrong with an innocent family who was in the wrong situation at the wrong time.The final section of the book, from their first of many trials to their execution, presents us with the moral dilemmas surrounding the punishment of crime. Capote does not make any definitive conclusions, but poses many questions: Is execution right or wrong? Why the long delay (approx. 6 years) between the guilty verdict and the execution? Was a fair trial possible or necessary, given the horrific nature of the crimes committed? It is impossible to summarize the impact of this book in a few paragraphs, but it will definitely stay with me for years to come.!121!In Cold Blood is the new school classics selection in the group catching up on classics for November 2016. Having read Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's recently and enjoying his writing, I could not wait to read this nonfiction thriller in advance of the upcoming group read. Writing in his relaxing southern style, Capote turns a horrid crime into a story to make the how's and whys accessible to the average American. It is in this regard that I rate this thrilling classic five stars. On November 15, 1959 Richard ""Dick"" Hickock and Perry Smith, on a tip from another inmate, brutally murdered four members of the Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas. Having heard that the Clutters possessed either a safe or $10,000 cash in their home, Smith and Hickock desired this wealth for themselves so that they could live out their days in a Mexican beach resort. To their surprise and chagrin, the Clutters did not have neither the safe nor the cash, but Hickock had said to leave no witnesses. Crime committed, the pair escaped to a life of continued crimes and violence and believing that authorities would never catch up with them. And in the beginning it appeared that this ill advised lifestyle might actually work. Due to the relentless work of the Kansas Bureau of Investigations (KBI) lead by Alvin Dewey, Hickock and Smith were eventually brought to justice and ultimately given the death penalty. Capote weaves a tale by giving us the backstory of both felons as well as a picture of Holcomb and nearby Garden City, Kansas as an idyllic place to raise a family. The crime changed everything. Families kept their doors locked and did not allow their children to venture far from home. In the surrounding areas, people viewed their lives as a before and after. Inevitably, the Clutter case lead to less community interaction and a beginning of a breakdown of society. Yet by providing the backstories of the felons, Capote allows the the readers to emphasize with their place in society. Dick Hickock was on his way to finishing at the top of his class with a possible athletic scholarship and a degree in engineering. His family could not afford a university education even with the scholarship so Hickock went to work. An automobile accident left him partially brain damaged as his parents maintained that he was not the same person since, and this one incident lead to his adult life of crime. Smith, on the other hand, lead a bleak childhood to the point where readers would feel sorry for him. Coming from a fractured family and only a third grade education, Smith suffered from a superiority complex his entire life. His role in the Clutter murders was the consummation of a lifetime of rejection. The felons came from diametrically opposed upbringings and yet I was left feeling remorse for both. Capote pieced together the crime to the point where I felt that I knew the people of Holcomb as well as the principal players in the crime intimately. This work lead to a new genre that brings together nonfiction and fiction in a way that history feels like a story. Both Capote and his research assistant Harper Lee ended up as award winning authors. Their fictional writing skills allowed for the personalization of this tale and ultimately help change the way many write nonfiction. Truman Capote is one of 20th America's master storytellers, and In Cold Blood is by many considered his opus. His research was detail oriented and allowed him to bring the story of the Clutter murders to the average American home. After completing this five star work painting the picture of the how's and whys of murder, I look forward to reading more of his charming Southern stories.!121!I am embarrassed to wait too long to read two brilliant true crime story novels : one of them is Helter Skelter and the other is of course this blood chilling, disturbing book I’m reviewing right now as I’m slapping my forehead. Sometimes I have hard time to prioritize my reading list and my chubby tbr may direct me wrong kind of books! But today I’m so happy to find my way to this classic after watching it’s amazing movie adaptation.  After four members of Herbert Clutter family were brutally killed in a small town named Holcomb located in Kansas, Mr. Capote decides to write an article about those murders by traveling to this small town just before the killers are caught.  He is accompanied by the one and only Harper Lee ( we realize they are childhood friends), making interviews with the locals who know about family history and police officers who are conducting the investigation. Six weeks later two perpetrators are finally convicted and executed in Kansas.  It’s quiet different nonfiction with its elaborated, long and detailed depictions. You want to skip those parts to focus on crimes and the trial process but you find yourself enjoy those chapters which are more like his short fiction stories than a nonfiction directly talking about the facts of crime.  Mr. Capote finish this book in six years and organize those thousands of pages interviews with people chronically. It was truly fascinating, unique classic. Especially loyal fans of true crime stories shouldn’t miss it! I’m so relieved to read at last! My favorite quotes: “Just remember: If one bird carried every grain of sand, grain by grain, across the ocean, by the time he got them all on the other side, that would only be the beginning of eternity.”“Imagination, of course, can open any door - turn the key and let terror walk right in.”“The enemy was anyone who was someone he wanted to be or who had anything he wanted to have.”“Those fellows, they're always crying over killers. Never a thought for the victims.”“In school we only learn to recognize the words and to spell but the application of these words to real life is another thing that only life and living can give us.”!121!In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was described by its author as a non-fiction novel. The novel was first published in 1965 and at the time this style of writing, perhaps even the template for a new genre, was fresh and new and bold. Almost 50 years later and the disturbing images are as fresh, vibrant and malevolent as when the ink was wet. The style of writing has no doubt inspired generations of writers since, but their imitation has done little to diminish the power of Capote’s work. Whether it was wholly accurate or not is for journalists and scholars to debate, but for the reader, his vision was compelling and his perspective on the crime, and especially as a character study, almost a biography, on the criminals is hypnotic. Critics may take umbrage with Capote’s sympathetic depiction of the killer’s plight, and perhaps such an argument has great merit, since the murderers showed no mercy to their victims, but Capote’s contribution lies in his objective illumination of all the surrounding facts and details of the crime. The author began with the crime scene outlines of the victims as they were stenciled on the floor of an upper middle class home in western Kansas and rippled outward until his narrative covered the lives, background and family dynamics of the victims, their murderers and the laws and cultures that had produced both. A staggeringly detailed account of a brutal slaying, Capote has left us with a rich literary gift that should be on a list of books that must be read.!121!This book is one of the first, if not the first, true crime novel. According to Wikipedia, only Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders has sold more copies in the True Crime category than In Cold Blood. While true crime fans might read this today and think that it sounds like your basic true crime story, at the time it was groundbreaking to detail a crime in this much detail and in a format as big as a novel.One of the things it appears that this novel set the precedence for, and that I have seen in other true crime novels, is that the author is not only researching the story, he is getting in the mix and talking face to face with the criminals (example - Ann Rule). Sometimes this leads to relationships and feelings that are reflected in the retelling. After you finish reading this, it is interesting to look this up online and see some of the theories about how Capote approached this crime and the people involved.Speaking of Capote, I have never seen any of the movies about him, but it sounds like all of them focus on this part of his life – and there are at least 3 of them! I may need to check them out to see what I think. Also, I need to check out the classic film that came out shortly after publication.One think I found very, very interesting  when speaking of what criminals could do on death row in Kansas, basically everything – every form of comfort, entertainment, ways to pass the time – were taken away from them. The justice system went out of their way to make things as uncomfortable as possible for those awaiting death. However, they let them read as much as they want. I am wondering why reading was the one acceptable past time they were given?One thing I forgot to add when I originally wrote this review was that having read this and Breakfast At Tiffany's, it is hard to believe it is the same author. Probably the most diverse writing from the same author I have ever encountered. True crime fans! Non-fiction fans! Fans of must read classics! You must add In Cold Blood to your list.!121!I know this book is considered a masterpiece. I know that I’m supposed to love it and be touched by its revolutionary take on the True crime genre but for some reason I just kept falling asleep while reading it. The novel addresses many key points about crime in the late 50s, about our justice system, about the pros and cons of capital punishment. I just got a little lost in all the minutia of it. I’m glad I read the book and got a taste of Truman Capote’s work but it didn’t touched me like I thought it would.!121!A seminal work for the nonfiction novel and the true crime genre, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood stands apart from most of its literary descendants. Not only is it compelling and suspenseful even when you know (like many crime dramatizations) what's going to happen, it's also very well-written. In fact, its literary quality gives In Cold Blood a dimension which few other nonfiction novels will match. The evolution of the form, since In Cold Blood, is nothing short of astonishing. It makes you appreciate how different the experience of reading the book is now compared to when the book was published. Yet, it is not a stuffy classic. This work made the world safe for nonfiction! Definitely worth reading!!121!as a massive bookworm and true crime enthusiast, i have no explanation for why its taken me so long to read this. maybe its because i prefer my true crime stories in the form of documentaries and podcasts. regardless, i was super excited to finally pick up the book that is considered the first true crime novel and pioneered the nonfiction subgenre. what really surprised me about this was how capote didnt just stick to the crime and the trial. the novel-like prose explores the familys life, the community of holcomb, and the psychological complexities of the murderers. after reading more about the process of capotes research and writing of this crime, it makes sense why he spends so much time talking about the murderers backgrounds, childhoods, relationships, and connections to each other. for those who are only looking for facts about the crime, i would stick to the wikipedia page. for those who want in-depth character profiles, then this is the book for you. ↠ 3.5 stars!121!I think that was the very first non fiction novel ever written. Brilliant prose, relentless to the point and merciless to the very end. You get a very compelling insight view on what was going on in that house come to know all the events that led to murder and death. Truman Capote interviewed one of the criminals for many hours in prison. This probably is the best real crime fiction that was ever written. You won't regret reading it and you will be glad that you're alive after reading. Absolutely recommended. A modern classic!!121!PART 1: STEVE’S REVIEW4.0 to 4.5 stars. Written over a period of 7 years and published in 1966, this novel, while not technically the first “true crime” non-fiction novel, is credited (correctly) with establishing the genre and being the progenitor of today's true crime novel. I would certainly agree that most of the other true crime novels that I have read followed almost the exact ""blue print"" laid out by Capote in this book. That is quite a testament to the technical excellence of this novel.The book recounts the story of the brutal murders in Holcomb, Kansas of a farmer named Herb Clutter, his wife and their two children. The book spends the early pages going back and forth between introducing the reader to the Clutter family and also to the two murderers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. I thought Capote did a superb job of allowing the reader to “get to know” the Clutter family (and the killers for that matter) so that impact of the actual murders would resonate more deeply.Overall, I thought the job that Capote did of laying out the story in the sequence that he did was masterful. By following the structure that he did he was able to keep the narrative tension high throughout the entire novel. This is a difficult task to accomplish when both the nature of the crime itself and the eventual fate of the perpetrators are known before you even pick up the book. However, Capote pulls it off and for that he deserves much credit. The novel is also much more comprehensive than just a detailed restatement of the murders. The book spends considerable time showing the effect the killings had on the Holcomb community and how different people responded to the event both postively and negatively. It follows the killers, both leading up to the murders and also during their time in hiding afterwards. Further, it recounts the actions of the police and the manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Smith and Hickock. Lastly, Capote spends considerable time on the trial of the two killers as well as the effect the trial and its aftermath had on the people most closely involved with the case. Overall, I thought the book was just about perfect in its execution. The critical events are detailed and fully-fleshed out without excess padding over the book’s 400 pages. I thought it was very interesting to discover that Capote produced almost 8000 pages worth of transcripts, notes and commentary from which he then distilled the final product. This certainly highlights the painstaking research Capote did and the unprecedented access he was given to the events and people surrounding this tragedy. An amazing achievement and one that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people read. PART 2: STEVE’S CONFESSIONI only gave this book 4.0 to 4.5 stars. I feel weird saying “only” when the rating means I more than really liked it (call it really, really, super duper liked it). It just wasn’t memorable enough for me to give it 5 stars. Sadly, I think this says more about me than it does about the merits of the book. The recounting of the killings just did not have the emotional impact on me that I think, in all fairness, they should have. I guess you could say that I was shocked to find myself “not shocked” by the recounting of the murders. Unfortunately, having grown up in a world that has been witness to horrors so far beyond the tragic events described in the novel, the slayings did not evoke the kind of visceral reaction that I would have expected. A contributing factor to this may be that at the same time as I was listening to this book on audio, I was reading Jack Ketchum’s Off Season and DRACULAS by J.A. Konrath et al, two of the goriest books I have ever read. The horrors recounted in Capote’s novel came across as very PG to PG-13. Again, that is both a sad and scary thing to realize just how “comfortable” you can become reading, watching or hearing about crimes like this one. I think this last comment leads nicely into the next section. PART 3: STEVE’S RANTHave the horrors of the world today really become so fucking “over the top” extreme that they have numbed me to the point where reading about the pre-meditated, unprovoked murder of a family of four doesn’t quite have the requisite “shock value” to immediately cause bile to rise in the back of my throat. In all honesty, YES!! In fact, I believe that as horrific as the killings were they would barely be a two minute headline on the evening news today. When you really stop to think about it, how catastrophically and dementedly fucked up is that!! The truth is that nowadays events like the Clutter family killings happen all too often. In fact, it's possible that if the murders happened today they might go completely ignored by everyone except the local news where they occurred. Sadly, when on any given day we might be hearing about some troubled teen going “Columbine” on his classmates because some douche bag tripped him in the lunch room or reading about some disgruntled worker deciding that the boss who fired him doesn’t deserve to live and so proceeds to kill a dozen of his former co-workers because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Don’t take my comments as advocating the curtailment of ANY form of entertainment being made today whether it be books, movies, music, video games or TV shows. NO, NO, No and please NO!! I like and love my violent, over the top, blood-soaked books, graphic novels and even TV shows (pause for a big shout out to Dexter). Now I could do without most of the real gory, slasher type films but hey, to each their own.So this is not about advocating change in what we watch or read (I certainly have no plans to change). I am simply recognizing the fact that as a society we have fallen down the “rabbit hole” and are living in a fucked up, violent, blood-soaked world that tears at our empathy on a daily basis. It is just something that many of us (myself included) seem to have become all too comfortable with it. Whether its loving us some Tony Soprano (and c’mon how can you not) or laughing as we shoot hookers during a game of Grand Theft Auto (I would note without further comment the current serial killings involving prostitutes) or hearing about another 5 dead American soldiers killed by a roadside bomb and then casually changing the channel to get back to the ball game so you can put it out of your mind. This is us. We have become the world that Cormac McCarthy envisioned in No Country for Old Men and, like Sheriff Tom Bell in McCarthy’s novel, I think it would be impossible for the people of Capote’s time to imagine the world as it is today. I am not sure what, if anything, all this says about us or me, but there you have it. Rant over, review concluded.!121!I do not, as I have said many a time, feel things very often. I am just shy of being a sociopathic monster, mainly because I consider myself to be way too cute and charming for that. (Except sociopaths are capable of charm...huh. Back to the drawing board.)Anyway. Even in my actual, real life, I try to experience emotions as infrequently as possible. This is only truer for the books I read.In Cold Blood is a true crime narrative detailing the crime, investigation, and trial related to the murder of four members of the Clutter family, and therefore I wasn’t planning on feeling anything if at all possible. Because, duh, emotions related to that aren’t exactly going to be the equivalent of “eating cotton candy while at the top of a Ferris wheel at a fair in the beginning of summer” or “hearing an infant laugh for the first time.”And yet, by page 50, Truman Capote had me feeling overwhelmingly fond of the Clutter family.I knew what was going to happen to them. Even if I hadn’t known the book’s synopsis going in, I would have felt the building tension. Somehow, though, even though I knew what was coming, I was really hoping the Clutters would be okay.Mr. Clutter, the tenet of his community. Mrs. Clutter, who finally felt she might be overcoming her lifelong struggle with mental health. Nancy, the sweet, kind teenager who overbooked herself because she didn’t want to say no to anybody. Kenyon, nerdier than his older sister, but smart and kind and passionate.As I read about their lives on and before November 15, 1959, I hoped they would be okay. Even as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock entered their home late at night, I hoped they would somehow leave a survivor. What I expected out of this book was an exciting, impressive rendering of a horrible crime. I got a lot more. I was made to care about these people, and to feel their loss. I empathized with their loved ones, their community, their police force. I could have read about the Clutters for much longer than I did.Unfortunately, the Clutters and the crime itself only took up about a third of the book. The remaining two thirds followed the investigation and the trial, but more than that, it followed the killers.I felt no pity for Dick Hickock. I don’t think I was supposed to, or I hope I wasn’t. Because that guy was a piece of total sh*t. I’m someone who believes that people can be partially exonerated by their circumstances, but Dick Hickock had no circumstance that could make up for what a f*cker he was.Perry Smith, on the other hand. Even for him, who suffered all his life, I was only able to feel partial pity. A sickening kind of pity - it nauseated me to read about him.Maybe if this book felt more focused on the Clutters, I would have given it five stars. I don’t know. It’s still a four star read because it’s so impressive. It’s no wonder that this book to some extent birthed the genre of true crime as it is today. The exhaustive research and attention to detail is pretty much astonishing, and the writing is for the most part beautiful.But the later parts of the narrative were sickening, and hard and unpleasant to read. Not just for their content, but for the treatment of the people it followed. I don’t know. It felt like it strayed a lot from the Clutters. Maybe it wasn’t ever supposed to be their story - maybe it was Perry and Dick’s all along. But I’d prefer to think it wasn’t.Bottom line: I love true crime. I love classics. This feels outside of both of those genres. Genre-defying. I don’t even know what it is. It’s good. Hopefully that’s enough.-------------PRE-REVIEWi am so glad that i'm sticking to my plan of reading a classic a month. (i'm so proud of myself you'd never guess it's THE SECOND MONTH OF THE YEAR.)i always forget how much i love classics until i pick them up??? they're classic for a reason.whatever. i digress. this is a great book and i'll review it at some point hurray!121!Reading Road Trip 2020Current location: KansasHow can I explain this? It was like I wasn't part of it. More as though I was reading a story. And I had to know what was going to happen. The end.If you ask a random American to name a book they associate with the state of Kansas, they will most likely answer The Wonderful World of Oz (a story more popularly known by the movie's name, The Wizard of Oz). If you ask a devoted reader the same question, you will get Oz, for sure, but you'll have a quick second answer: In Cold Blood.Having already read Frank Baum's underwhelming story about Oz several years ago, I knew this book would be my obvious choice for Kansas. But I didn't want it to be.You see. . . although I respect Truman Capote as a writer, I am not the reader for this. I don't read “true crime” novels, and I don't read horror, real or otherwise. And this is horror. Real life horror. And it is. . . horrific.I can't think of a better way to express to you what my experience of reading this book looked like this week other than to share this photo of a beloved Seinfeld episode: As implausible as it seems, both The Wizard of Oz and In Cold Blood do share something in common. . . two really creepy bad guys: But, even though I'm trying to lighten the mood with a little humor here, it's only an act. I experienced nothing but heaviness this week. This is a heartbreaking true story, and, even though I believe it to be Mr. Capote's magnum opus, I can only express the greatest relief that this particular read is over. (Thus four stars, not five. Five, for me, means I look forward to a reread).This is a story of broken people who broke people. It was soul crushing for me.To be murdered. To be murdered. No. No. There's nothing worse. Nothing worse than that. Nothing.!121!Capote paints perfect pictures of every character. You can almost feel them breathing right beside you. Their thoughts, their mannerisms, their physique, their psyche, etc. Bravo.He painstakingly describes every detail—with thousands of commas and dashes preceding thousands of commas and dashes—his keen sense of observation (and exaggeration) is both impressive and tiring at the same time. I felt that Truman probably held the details of every interview close to his heart hence a lot of unnecessary banter between town-folk, relatives and even very minor characters were not omitted. The conversations were crucial, but somewhat too plenty.I couldn't help but think of one of Disney's famous editing principles while reading this book: If it's not important in the telling of the story, cut it out. Of course, this is way beyond the family-oriented themes good ol' Walt implemented. It's gruesome, shocking and certainly deserves the accolade of the ""true-crime"" genre.I love how Capote matter-of-factly drops sentences that depict the horror of the crime done after a rather mundane recollection of events. ""I slit his throat."" is one. Narratives of Nancy, Sue, Al Dewey stood out, perhaps because they had a natural flow to the story-telling and did not sound like a police report. Mrs. Kidwell's dream, though briefly described and wildly unbelievable, was haunting.Now let me tell you why I am not impressed. My biggest question is: Would I have enjoyed this book if I didn't know that it was real? Will it stand up on its own minus the decades of controversy around it?The answer lies in the text itself. The book is obviously a novelized transcript of interviews: if it isn't, then it certainly felt like it was. Truman Capote ""filled in the blanks"" with suppositions, questionable truths, and fictional drama—that wouldn't be an issue had he not boldly claimed his work to be ""non-fiction"".It is my belief that Truman wanted to shock the mainstream with his empathic crusade for the murderers. Without question, he had an affinity for Perry and Judge Tate, and a clear distaste for Dick. Perhaps during the interviews, Hickok was appalled by Truman's nosy intrusions and homosexuality—that's just a guess—while Smith was more accommodating.I am not sure if I am simply desensitized by the countless crime books, tv shows and movies I've seen. But I did not feel an ounce of pity towards the criminals. Things would have probably been different if I had read this in the 60s or 70s when coverage of crimes like these were bold and anti-Hollywood, therefore ""cool"".Forgive my natural tendency to reject what's popular...for what most claim to be ""a really great novel"". I just had too many ""Oh c'mon, how could you (Capote) have been there to know that?"" moments to merit praise. Based on further research, many of the characters deny that many events in the book (Mrs. Meir having a picnic with Perry in jail for one) really happened.Had this been categorized as a tale based on true events, then I would have given it double the stars. If you say this story is true, then I'll be doggoned if pertinent details were fabricated just to express that ""creative license"". It doesn't only not help in the telling of the story, it just makes the story something else entirely—a fictional one.!121!I thought to myself, do I need to write another review for one of the best true crime books ever written? And then I thought, yeah, you do. You’ve written reviews on terrible, stupid and boring books and a book this good, it definitely deserves another one. This is the best story about true crime that I have ever read. Hands down.After painting a peaceful scene in the Midwest plains of America, evil makes it's presence felt. This is how the book starts and Truman Capote’s writing had my blood chilled and my heart sad for the victims.It is about the murders in 1959 of the Clutter family at their farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas. The four murders received a ton of media attention, as the motive was unclear. Two recently released convicts, seeking a fortune that did not exist, invade the Clutter family home, tie up the four family members present and leave no witnesses.For the reader, Capote’s vision was gripping and his outtake on the crime was fantastic. His character study was almost a biography. The killers were still impulsive and cruel, but he got into their minds and made them seem more human.Capote took an actual event, a gruesome crime, and used his writing to bring it to life. The sad truth is that if he had not written In Cold Blood, no one outside of Holcomb, Kansas would know who the Clutter family is or the killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. The murders and the execution effectively ended all of their lives but Truman Capote gave them all immortality in this amazing book.!121!Τα πέντε αστέρια δίνονται πρόθυμα, ειλικρινή και ένθερμα στο «Εν ψυχρώ», πρωτίστως για την εκπληκτική δουλειά του συγγραφέα και τον διακριτικό, ταπεινό, διεισδυτικό σεβασμό που χαρακτηρίζει την τεχνική ύφους και γραφής του βιβλίου. Ακολουθεί μια σιωπηρή αξιοπρέπεια στην αφήγηση των γεγονότων χωρίς να αποστασιοποιείται απο την τραγωδία, δίχως επικλήσεις συναισθηματικών εξάρσεων, χωρίς επιτήδευση και μακριά απο την τυπική δημοσιογραφική προσέγγιση. Ένα λογοτεχνικό έργο που δεν δείχνει, δεν προμηνύει το μακριά, το μέλλον, το μετά, μα εστιάζει στην ουσία της πραγματικής ιστορίας. Καταφέρνει με αριστουργηματικό τρόπο να παραμένει αόρατη η μακρόχρονη έρευνα και επεξεργασία που έκανε πριν μας χαρίσει μια αληθινή αίσθηση εγκληματικής φαντασίας ως εν ψυχρώ εμπειρία. Το βιβλίο αναφέρεται σε μια ανατριχιαστικά βάναυση δολοφονία μιας ευκατάστατης, αγροτικής οικογένειας, στο Κάνσας το 1959. Οι δολοφόνοι, δυο περιθωριακοί, απλοί τυχοδιώκτες, θύτες και θύματα μιας αγιάτρευτης κοινωνικής ψυχοπαθογένειας. Το κίνητρο τους αβάσιμο, το σκεπτικό τους ασταθές, το έγκλημα τους μοιραία και ανησυχητικά τυχαίο. Η εξέλιξη γεγονότων και συμπτώσεων που προκαλούν τον αφανισμό της οικογένειας είναι μια λεπτή διαχωριστική γραμμή ανάμεσα στα πάντα,που φαίνονται και είναι κανονικά στην καθημερινότητα των ανθρώπων και στην απόλυτη καταστροφή, που χτυπάει ξαφνικά απο το πουθενά. Ο θεμελιώδης σεβασμός είναι το στοιχείο που διεισδύει και μεταφέρεται σε όλο το βιβλίο. Ο Καπότε σέβεται την οικογένεια των θυμάτων που τους σκιαγραφεί με απόλυτα κομψό άγγιγμα. Αποδέχεται χωρίς μεγαλοστομίες την τοπική επιβολή των νόμων στην αγροτική περιοχή καθώς και τον τρόπο ζωής και σκέψης του λαού της. Δείχνει βαθιά εκτίμηση σε κάθε ανθρώπινη ύπαρξη, σε θεσμούς και φορείς που συνθέτουν την λειτουργεία της κοινωνίας. Ακόμη κι όταν αμφισβητεί τη δικαστική διαδικασία το κάνει σιωπηρά και όσο πιο αντικειμενικά θα άρμοζε στην αξιοπρέπεια. Θαύμασα απεριόριστα το σπουδαίο ταλέντο της ενσυναίσθησης του συγγραφέα καθώς και την κατανόηση που εκφράζει όταν αναλύει τις ζωές των δολοφόνων. Σε πρώτη φάση αφηγείται την πορεία των γεγονότων προς το έγκλημα με σαφήνεια, μα σε πιο βαθύ επίπεδο τα αφήνει όλα μυστήρια, αναπάντητα και ανεξήγητα αναφορικά με τις αιτίες που δημιουργούν έναν δολοφόνο. Αίσθηση τραγωδίας διαπνέει την διαμόρφωση της ζωής τους, μα ο τελικός απολογισμός δείχνει καθαρά να σέβεται όχι το «ποιοι» ήταν οι δολοφόνοι αλλά το ποιοι θα «μπορούσαν» να είναι. *Αξιοθαύμαστο*Η απίστευτη λεπτομέρεια στην περιγραφή, τα στοιχεία που συνέθεσαν το αποτέλεσμα, το ίδιο το έγκλημα, οι δραστηριότητες των εμπλεκομένων στην υπόθεση ή των απλών παρατηρητών, καθώς και αναλυτικές συσχετίσεις με άλλα εγκλήματα εξίσου απεχθή και ανελέητα, αποκαλύπτουν την αξία του συγγραφέα. Τίποτα δεν ακυρώνει το βασικό αίσθημα της τραγωδίας και το τελικό αποτέλεσμα ολοκληρώνεται με μια αιώνια σύγκρουση. Η ρίζα του κακού είναι η μόνιμη φθονερή αντιπαράθεση δυο κόσμων που οριοθετούν την παγκόσμια κοινωνία. Ο δυσλειτουργικός, βίαιος, στερημένος κόσμος των ασθενέστερων κοινωνικών στρωμάτων εκδικείται με αναδρομικά κατάλοιπα τους εκπροσώπους των τακτοποιημένων και ευκατάστατων κοινωνικών τάξεων που εκπροσωπούν επιτυχία και εξουσία. Τελειώνοντας αφήνει την πικρή γεύση της ανασφάλειας και του φόβου στον αναγνώστη που μπορεί να ξεχωρίσει τους δυο κόσμους ... και να συμπεράνει ως εκ τούτου, πως, τέτοιου είδους μυστήρια πίσω απο αυτή την ιστορία, μένουν πάντα ��νεξιχνίαστα. Ό,τι παραμένει για πάντα ανεπίλυτο είναι προφανές πως μπορεί να επαναληφθεί και να εξελιχθεί με πιο δραματική βάση και ουσία. Καλή ανάγνωση. Πολλούς ασπασμούς.!121!As an English reader I had not heard of the Clutter massacre, and all I knew about Truman Capote was his novel ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". It took a while before I recognised this novel as truly great. The 1950's domesticity did not appeal to me. It seemed alien, claustrophobic, gender-specific and rather dull. But after a while I realised the genius in describing the setting of this time and place to the minutest detail. The ""New York Times"" calls In Cold Blood ""The best documentary account of an American crime ever written."" It is a ground-breaking book by Truman Capote, generally agreed to be the first factual novel, although others had explored the idea before. It is about the murders in 1959 of the Clutter family at their farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas. The four murders received a lot of media attention, as the motive was unclear. Partly because of this Capote and his friend author Harper Lee decided to travel to Kansas to write about the crime before the killers were apprehended. They painstakingly interviewed all the local residents and investigators, taking numerous notes which Capote subsequently worked into his novel over the next six years. The killers, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith were arrested six weeks after the murders, but Capote does not start at that point; not at the point of the actual slayings for dramatic effect, as many writers would. He starts by describing the comfortable, happy family lives of devout Christian people living in the small town of Holcomb down to the smallest detail. Their daily lives, the aspirations of both old and young, the clinical depression of Bonnie Clutter (the mother, Herbert's wife) are all carefully set down. Carefully woven into the narrative, Capote also writes a dispassionate account of the killers' early childhoods, recording the highlights and events which in retrospect seem shocking in the extreme, but are so meticulously recorded by Capote that they form a non-judgmental picture. It is the juxtaposition made by Capote which means that the reader assesses the situation for themselves. The impoverished and brutal early childhood (some of the cruellest episodes ironically were perpetrated by nuns) of Perry Smith contrasts sharply with the settled happy community who had been devastated by the event. First hand accounts from the residents are included. Most were fearful; all were stunned and confused. Some bent on revenge, some on forgiveness. Every single one in this church-going community seemed to want to do the Right Thing, though they differed as to what that was. The feelings - the stress and deteriorating health of investigators involved - became more intense as the search went on. Truman increases the feeling of suspense as the search continued whilst making us more familiar with the two characters who had perpetrated it, so we are familiar with both Perry Smith's abusive childhood and Dick Hickock's head injuries and possible brain trauma following a car crash in 1950. At no point however does the author comment on such episodes; he remains impartial. He does not really need to. The reader now has ample material to make subtle inferences as to how responsible for their actions these two could be. The actual murders are recorded about halfway through the book, and the following 6 weeks where they were on the run is chronicled as a time when the relationship between the two was breaking down. Here are the thoughts of Dick Hickock, as he envisages setting off on his own, as set down by Capote.  ""Goodbye, Perry. Dick was sick of him - his harmonica, his aches and ills, his superstitions, the weepy womanly eyes, the nagging, whispering voice. Suspicious, self-righteous, spiteful he was like a wife that must be got rid of."" In turn Perry Smith is beginning to wonder why he ever admired Dick Hickock, who takes a delight in running over stray dogs and prefers to steal even when they do have money in their pockets. Both are coming across as extremely damaged personalities, before we ever get to any formal psychiatric analysis.The pair were eventually tracked down by the evidence of a former cell-mate Floyd Wells. Having himself worked for Herbert Clutter he chatted to Dick Hickock about how well off this Methodist family were, giving details of the farmhouse, habits of the family, whether they had a safe etc. When he saw the subsequent use Dick Hickock had made of the information he told the police. (He claimed that although Hickock had stated to him that he would kill all the family, such boasts were so common in prison as to be meaningless. In addition, there was a reward for information.)There was enough other evidence to convict the pair - photographs made of bloody shoe prints which had been invisible to the naked eye, a radio which had been stolen from the house at the time of the attack and subsequently sold ... It seems precious little evidence to present-day readers used to DNA analysis etc, but coupled with the evidence given by the prisoners later, as to where they had disposed of the weapons etc, this was enough at the time.Capote uses the statements made by both prisoners (who were kept separate so that there could be no collaboration) to describe these horrific events. By this clever device the part of the novel which could have been almost unbearable to read takes on a clinical feel. It is never sensationalist or gratuitous. These are the killers' own words.At this point the complex psychological relationship between the men comes more into prominence. We already feel we know these men; we know perhaps some of the reasons why they were able to do what they did. It is becoming poignantly clear that what sparked the actual events was the complex relationship between the two, who in turn relied on each other, admired each other, hated each other ... Here is a quote from Perry Smith to detective Dewey, ""Then he says to me as we're heading along the hall towards Nancy's room, ""I'm gonna bust that little girl."" And I said, ""Uh-huh. But you'll have to kill me first""….that's something that I despise. Anybody that can't control themselves sexually."" And again, most revealingly as picked up by a psychologist later, ""I didn't want to harm the man. I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat."" And of Dick Hickock, ""I meant to call his bluff… I didn't realise what I'd done til I heard the sound. Like somebody drowning…. Dick panicked….I couldn't leave him like he was…. Then I aimed the gun."" Dick Hickock also shared this antagonism against his partner, but it was only later when his former cellmate Floyd Wells was called as witness, that Capote says, with a flash of insight he realised he was not as dangerous as Perry. ""Suddenly he saw the truth. It was Perry he ought to have silenced."" Capote states that Alvin Dewey, the investigator most involved with this case considered that the two versions of the killings were very much alike. But he concluded that the confessions of how and why failed to satisfy his sense of meaningful design. The crime was a psychological accident, virtually an impersonal act. The actual amount of money stolen was between 40 and 50 dollars.The lead up to the trial, as everything else, is carefully documented. The choice of legal representation, of the judge, of the jurors. One potential juror said, when asked his opinion of capital punishment, that he was ordinarily against it, but in this case, no. Yet he was still allocated to the jury. There were no qualified psychiatrists within Garden City, where the trial held. The prosecuting attorney referred to the profession as a ""pack of head-healers"" sympathetic to the defendants. ""Those fellows, they're always worrying over the killers. Never a thought for the victims….. Our own local physicians attend to the matter. It's no great job to find whether a man is insane or an idiot or an imbecile."" Whereas the defending counsel said, ""Whatever their crime, these men are entitled to examination by persons of training and experience… Psychiatry has matured rapidly in the last twenty years."" Listening to both sides, the judge acted strictly within law, appointing 3 Garden City doctors, despite the fact that the unpaid services of a qualified psychiatrist experienced in such cases had been offered.Details from the trial stick in the memory. The testimony of Dick Hickock's father, who was seriously ill at the time (he died months later) but was mocked by the prosecuting attorney for getting the dates of the car accident which led to his son's head injuries and subsequent personality change wrong. One eminent psychiatrist had been called as a defence witness. However the judge only allowed him a yes/no answer to the question, could he could state that the defendants knew the difference between right and wrong. He answered ""Yes"" in respect of the first one, then was dismissed. No further comment was allowed. Presumably faced with an impossible question to answer in those terms he then answered ""No"" to the question when put about the second accused. Again, no further elucidation was allowed by the judge, as this was perfectly allowable under Kansas law. Capote goes on to quote the psychiatrist's prepared analysis, after his examinations of the defendants, which presents a much fuller picture. The conditions described after several intensive interviews he had had with the killers use terms which are more familiar to modern readers - organic brain damage from the accident, schizophrenia and dissociative behaviour, where an individual suddenly finds himself destroying some key figure in his past, who may be unclear to him. They may well have been new concepts to the jurors who were in the main farming people, but they were not privy to this crucial information in any case.Although the ending of the trial is a foregone conclusion, the actual execution of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith did not take place for a further 5 years. Capote explains that in the US judicial system it is possible to appeal several times, and that this is common practice. He spends a further part of the novel in describing the characters and crimes committed by various other inmates on Death Row. Interestingly, this part of the novel is not as objective as the rest. Capote's feelings begin to impose more. Perhaps it did not seem as important to be scrupulously impartial as these cases were not crucial to the main text. What it does do for the reader however, is to create a feeling of the suspension of reality - a reflection of the interminable waiting that the prisoners must have felt in their turn.The execution by hanging, the witnesses, the quiet behaviour of the killers is all described. And a final short scene is added which is pure fiction, where Alvin Dewey goes to the graves of the Clutter family and meets one of the children's close friends, now an adult. This I found quite allowable as a coda. It ties up the ends nicely, and I am not sure how else Capote could have done this, without inserting his views in a summing-up, which clearly he did not want to do.This novel is not only ground-breaking but superbly crafted; a pretty near perfect novel. The continual switch between present and past tenses only serves to give a more immediate feel; an edge to the narration. My star rating? Well, I cannot say, I ""like it"", (3 or 4 stars) but I can say, ""It was amazing!"" Five stars.!121!In Cold Blood is a non-fiction recount about the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas on a November night in 1959. Admittedly, I knew very little of the story prior to reading this book, as this took place well before my time, nearly 30 years before I was born. This is the first Capote book I’ve read and despite the somber subject, I found it to be an engaging read. It’s impressive that Capote was able to reconstruct the story, background and investigation with the level of detail provided throughout the book. I felt like a thorough picture was painted of who the Clutter family was, as well as who the two murderers were. Troubled pasts and pent up resentments are no excuse for the horrific crime they committed, though it was interesting to rewind and see how the killers had reached this point. I was not unhappy to see justice ultimately served in this case. I enjoyed Capote’s writing style in In Cold Blood, a leisurely build - initially two “separate” stories that undoubtedly, knowing the premise of the book, will intertwine at some point, and continue keep you engaged all along the way.!121!This honestly is one of the best books I have ever read and it certainly was the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I was utterly captivated by it, from start to finish. The way it was written was just so perfect and fitting - incredibly suspenseful and matter of fact, but still with a touch of emotion. I think the official term for this book is ""non-fiction novel"" and while I get why it gets this label, I personally wouldn't actually call it that. Sure, it has the quality of a novel and shares some of the characteristics, but there is something else there, something that makes this specific book unique. Even though it's as captivating as a novel, it doesn't exactly read like fiction. I was always painfully aware that this is NOT a made up story, that all of this has, in fact, really happened. The whole thing was told with so much intensity that you just KNOW that all of this HAS to come from real life.It was extremely easy for me to picture everything in my head, literally everything! There was an entire movie playing in my head while reading and I loved. every. single. second. of it.Something I also very much appreciated was the fact that Capote didn't insert himself into the story. If you do some googling, you can find out how interesting his research journey was. To give you a short summary: He drove to the area of the crime shortly after it happened, accompanied by his childhood friend Harper Lee (yes, that Harper Lee), they talked to residents and investigators and together they collected over 8.000 (!) notes; later Capote also talked to the perpetrators directly - altogether he worked six years on the book. I'm sure he would have had lots to tell about this whole journey and I'm sure it would have been interesting as well. HOWEVER, it would have been ill-fitting and inappropriate in a book about such a serious topic. Capote concentrated on what's important - why and how these murders were committed and who the killers and, more importantly, who the victims were. The whole thing just seemed really respectful, everyone got the amount of time and space they deserved.I make such a big deal out of this because I've seen it happen before, someone writing a non-fiction book and them making a lot of it about themselves and their own life, making the whole thing part-memoir. When I pick up a book about a certain topic I expect to read about this topic and not about the authors life! So yeah, I am very much thankful that Capote focused on the right things here.All in all, this truly was just a magnificent book. Seriously, I could write down every single positive adjective in the English language and all of them would express what I feel.I recommend it to everyone, even to the people who aren't particularly interested in true crime, simply so you can experience some wonderful and well thought out writing.!121!ChillingAn outstanding and powerful work of literature, even more impressive because it conveyed true crimes, a profound investigative insight, the vivid sense of time and place, and the atmosphere that cloaked the evil events carried out on November 15 in 1959, in Holcomb, Kansas. Truman Capote is an artist that painted every detail of the story with such a detailed flow that causes us to stop and appreciate the surroundings rather than wishing the story was being pushed at a faster pace.Looking at America in the 50s from the perspective of a foreigner we often think more of a Holywood version of an innocent age, affluent, white picket fences, apple pie, and rock and roll pervading the airwaves. If anyone asked me when and where I'd liked to have lived it would have been the US in the 1950s. In Cold Blood smashes that image with the reality that cruelty can take away life, a community’s character and the idyllic vision I'd imagined above. The murders of four of the Clutter family by Dick Hickock and Perry Smith for $40, stunned not only the population of Holcomb but ultimately a world-wide audience. My vision, I so wanted to believe of the US, couldn't have been better envisioned than by Holcomb in the 1950s, where families rarely locked their doors and the safety of the neighbourhood was never doubted. Hickock and Smith not only brutally destroyed the lives of four innocent people but destroyed the fundamental promise of safety in our own homes.The story explores the background of the murderers, what drove them, how they considered what they had done, the investigation into the crimes, and the community that became fearful and suspicious that for a long time they did not know who was responsible. To achieve this nonfiction novel with such beautiful prose is a seminal point in literature where it is arguable that Capote created a new genre.I have for a long time been fascinated by the relationship between Truman Capote and Harper Lee and how they helped each other research and draft their renowned classics. It is interesting that Harper Lee had been inspired during the ‘In Cold Blood’ collaboration with Capote to research and use the case of Robert Burns who shot dead the serial killer, Reverend Willie Maxwell, to write her own true-crime novel - which never materialised. Another relationship Capote shattered during his years of self-destruction.I do believe this is a must-read novel and is surely a classic and a powerful combination of true-crime with such beautiful writing talent. I have my wonderful friend Julie Grippo who encouraged me to read this book and read along with me when I had the opportunity to do so. Thank you so much, Julie, and please see her brilliant review at https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...!121!I almost gave up on this classic. The reason I didn't is that this was the very first book I added to my want-to-read shelf when I signed up for this account in 2014! It'll bring bad juju if you know what I mean. 😶‍🌫️

I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat. 


This is a true crime classic published in 1965. In Cold Blood covers a detailed account of the murder, investigation, trial, and execution in the Clutter family murder case. Four members of the Clutter family were bound, gagged, and shot in the head at their Holcomb, Kansas home. Father (also got his throat slashed), mother, and their two youngest high school-age children. I had to listen to the first hour of the audiobook twice. This is rather strange where the middle of the book held most of my attention, the investigation. I had to remind myself this isn't fiction! The trial was rather exhausting and very detailed. What I found interesting is Capote traveled to Kansas to investigate/research for the book with fellow author and friend Harper Lee. The book was completed and published a few months after the execution of the perpetrators.Read for Book Across America BINGO - Snag A Read For Free Group!121!There is no doubting Truman Capote is a writer extraordinaire. For those of you who haven’t read this classic piece (I think I was the only person on this planet not to do so - oh, and Antoinette, Annie, Jonathan, Rebecca, Lori et al) – it’s really an excellent work of journalism. Capote spent six years researching the brutal murders of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas back in 1959. During this time he got to know the two murderers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock.One aspect of this work I really like is the fact Capote humanises these two characters. It is always so easy to label the likes of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock as monsters and be done with it. But, as heinous as their crimes are – and they are – they still have stories to tell. Capote manages to do this with a very fine brush, he strikes a balance of not being supportive and not being hostile to these two men. It is a fine example of objective storytelling.On that, Capote does present this as a story. It could easily have been written as a gruesome piece of fiction. There is no need to describe the murders in this review, but for two guys to commit such acts just goes to show, these kinds walk amongst us.In Cold Blood comes in at a relatively underweight 340 pages, but it reads like a morbidly obese 800-page chunkster. You know the type of book? Every page jam-packed with text, small font, each paragraph gorged with intricate detail. No skim reading here, as each word is important. If you are tired and want to ‘flick’ through a paragraph or two, you’ll be found out – GOTYA!! I did have to re-read some sections again.The reasons I didn’t give this 5-stars are twofold:1.	I am going to be stingier with my stars in 2022. I’ve been throwing around stars like a drunken sailor – thus devaluing the currency. 2.	There were some sections of this book I found to be much too heavy going. Capote did go off on several historical tangents, these contained incredible detail – and sometimes, usually after a long day – I just thought ”Enough Already”. But it’s more me than Truman – perhaps I wasn’t up to his writing?There is plenty here for one to go researching these murders, the Clutter family and the perpetrators. The physical descriptions of Smith and Hickock in this book are really accurate. There’s plenty of other details to cross reference too if you enjoy that sort of thing – and who doesn’t?I did watch a Johnny Carson interview of Capote on YouTube yesterday where the latter explained that watching the hanging of the two murderers was enough to put anybody off Capital Punishment. Apparently it can take up to twenty minutes for the heart to stop beating. Gruesome stuff and this observation in no way mitigates the severity and brutality of the crimes that took place in Holcomb, Kansas back in 1959. If you do take the time with this one, you will find out it’s worth it.4 Stars (maybe a bit stingy but 2022 is the year of Miser Mark)!121!A sprawling, unflinching look into a grisly small-town murder motivated by greed and enabled by an astounding indifference to human suffering, written in arresting prose that fully renders the psychology of the perpetrators and victims alike.","['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'History', 'Thriller']"
Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (Paperback),Malcolm Gladwell,3.96,590168,2005,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing.!121!As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"".!121!Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm GladwellThe author describes the main subject of his book as ""thin-slicing"": our ability to use limited information from a very narrow period of experience to come to a conclusion. The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical. For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said ""Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that thing has never been in the ground"".عنوانهای

اندیشیدن میاندیشیم، درباره ی تصمیم‌هایی است، که در یک لحظه گرفته می‌شوند ــ در یک چشم به‌ هم زدن ــ؛ و همه ی این‌ها به آن سادگی‌ها که به‌ دیده می‌آیند، نیستند؛ چرا برخی از افراد، تصمیم‌ گیرهای والایی هستند، در حالی‌که برخی دیگر ناتوانند؟ چرا برخی پیرو غرایزشان هستند، و برنده می‌شوند، در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما، واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند، که توضیحشان برای دیگران، ناممکن است؟ در کتاب «یک نگاه»، با روان‌شناسی آشنا می‌شویم، که می‌داند چطور با مشاهده ی چند دقیقه‌ ای صحبت زوج‌ها، طول زندگی زناشویی آن‌ها را، پیش‌بینی کند؛ مربی تنیسی، که می‌داند، پیش از اصابت راکت با توپ، آیا بازیکن خطا می‌کند، یا خیر؛ متخصصان عتیقه‌ شناسی، که با یک نگاه، اصل بودن، یا تقلبی بودن آن شی‌ء را، تشخیص می‌دهند؛ هم‌چنین شکست‌های بزرگ، قضاوت در یک نگاه نیز، در این کتاب شرح داده می‌شوند: انتخاب «وارن هاردینگ»؛ تولید کوکای جدید؛ و کشتن «دیالو» توسط پلیس را؛ کتاب «یک نگاه» فاش می‌کند، که تصمیم‌ گیرنده‌ های بزرگ، آن‌هایی نیستند، که بیشترین اطلاعات را فرآوری می‌کنند، یا بیشترین زمان را، صرف اندیشیدن می‌نمایند، بلکه کسانی هستند، که هنر تمام عیار «برش نازک» را، دارند، یعنی از بین انواع ویژگیهای مربوط به یک مسئله، اصلی‌ترین آن‌ها را جدا می‌کنندنقل نمونه متن: (پیش درآمد: مجسمه ای که اصل نبود؛ در سپتامبر سال1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام «جیان فرانکو به چینا» به موزه «پاول گتی کالیفرنیا» مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد، مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد، که متعلق به شش سده پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به «کورس» بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده، با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته، و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی، یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود، که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف، یا متلاشی شده بودند، و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود، و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود، و مبلغ پیشنهادی «به چینا» زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه «گتی» با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه «کورس» را به امانت گرفت، و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه «کورس آناویسوس» در موزه ملی باستان شناسی «آتن» بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما «به چینا» مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه «گتی» ارائه داد، که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، «کورس» از سال1930میلادی، در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک «سوییسی» به نام «لوفن برگر» نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری «یونانی» به نام «روسس» خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام «استنلی مارگولیس» از دانشگاه «کالیفرنیا» به موزه آمد، و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد، و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه، تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد، و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید، که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر «دُلومیت» معدن قدیمی «کیپ وتی» در جزیره «تاسوس» ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه ی نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا «دُلومیت» تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه «گتی» از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات، با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز سال1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ «نیویورک تایمز» حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد، متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، «ماریون ترو»، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال، مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام «فدریکو زِری»، مورخ هنرشناس «ایتالیایی»، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر سال1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته ن��یخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های «یونانی» بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آ��جلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان «آرتور هافتن» متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، «هریسون» چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!»؛ «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب «هافتن» مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه «گتی» با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ سال1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ سال1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ سال1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه «گتی» همان سبک مجسمه «آناویسوس» را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی، دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند، بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه «کورس تنه آ» بود که در موزه «مونیخ» نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود، که در سال1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس «بریتانیایی» در «سوییس» پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس، تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها، میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید؛ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر «دلومیتی» را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه «گتی» تصویری از مجسمه «کورس» چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود پاصد و سی سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه «گتی» پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست)؛ پایان

 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman.!121!I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter.!121!I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society.!121!O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4!121!I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think.!121!so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry.!121!This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no.!121!Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf...!121!Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell.!121!The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.…We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem. We’re a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don’t really have an explanation for.Blink is an interesting book, full of examples of situations when you would be better off trusting your snap judgment over a long, well-reasoned approach. It’s counterintuitive, and it seems like research may continue to flesh out which items are the ones that should be processed by snap decision (such as the book’s heart attack diagnosis example). But the anecdotes were consistently fascinating, and it even explained why Pepsi always wins the Pepsi Challenge yet Coca Cola always sells more soda. Worth reading! Recommended.!121!Probably the best among Gladwell's books. He still stands true to his success mantra - ""Gladwell - The Power of Inductive Reasoning."" But, it was still a well researched and informative book. Blink.!121!I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct.!121!امتیاز واقعی 3.5پلیس مرد رو تعقیب می کنه. مرد دستش رو داخل جیبش می کنه. اسلحه همراهش داره یا نه؟ شلیک میکنه یا نه؟ پلیس باید چکار کنه؟ در اون یک لحظه چطور تصمیم میگیره؟برای اولین بار زوجی رو با هم می بینید. هیچ دعوایی در کار نیست. با هم می خندند و حر�� می زنند ولی حس میکنید مشکلی بینشون هست. چه مشکلی؟ مگه همه چیز ظاهرا خوب نیست؟یک کارشناس هنری از یک گالری نقاشی بازدید میکنه. با دیدن یک اثر بلافاصله حس بدی بهش دست میده. این نقاشی کپی شده. از کجا می دونه؟ فقط میدونه، نمی تونه به راحتی توضیح بدهرزومه حرف نداره. مصاحبه کاری هم خوب پیش رفت و نکته خاصی نبود ولی دوست ندارید این آدم رو استخدام کنید. چرا؟ چه دلیل حرفه ای برای این تصمیمتون دارید؟ این کتاب در مورد همین تصمیم های لحظه ای هست. تصمیم هایی که در مغز ما اما در نقطه ای به دور از رادار آگاهی گرفته می شن و خیلی از رفتارهای ما رو شکل میدن. این تصمیمات می تونن به شدت درست باشند. تجربه ها، اطلاعات و مهارت هایی که در طول زندگی کسب کردیم ممکنه به بهترین نحو در این تصمیم گیری های لحظه ای استفاده بشن و با کمترین داده به بهترین نتیجه برسندیک پلیس با تجربه با استفاده از بررسی لحظه ای تمام مواجهه های قبلی و مقایسه اون ها تصمیم میگیره که مرد نمی خواد شلیک کنهیک کارشناس با آنالیز لحظه ای تمام آثاری که در زندگیش دیده تصمیم میگیره که این اثر کپی شدهاما این تصمیم های لحظه ای می تونن همونقدر غلط و گمراه کننده باشند. کافیه از داده های اشتباه استفاده کنند، از تعصبات ریشه دار مغز نسبت به جنسیت ها، رنگ پوست و تمایلات پنهان ما به خصوصیت هایی که در مغز تکاملی ما نشان دهنده ی ""برتری"" هستند. مثل قد بلند مردانبرای همینه که اون مرد قد کوتاه یا زن غیر جذاب با رزومه ی عالی برای اون شغل مناسب به نظر نمیادیا پلیس به مرد سیاه پوستی که داره کیفش رو از جیبش در میاره شلیک می کنهباور نمی کنید ذهنتون پر از این داده های غلطه؟ نژادپرست نیستید؟ زن و مرد رو برابر می دونید؟ با دگرباش ها مشکلی ندارید؟ این تست ها رو بدید و متوجه چاله های مخفی ذهنتون بشید Harvard Implicit Association Testپس نتیجه چیه؟ استفاده از این تصمیم های لحظه ای خوبه یا بده؟ گلدول در این قسمت جواب خاصی نداره. وقتی درسته خیلی خوبه و وقتی غلطه خیلی بده! متخصص و کارشناس بودن احتمال درست بودن این تصمیم ها رو بالا می بره و تعصبات ذهنی باعث ضعفشون میشهو این دقیقا نقطه ضعف کتابه. ایده ی عالی و ساختار نامشخص. نویسنده حدوداً می دونه می خواد از چی بنویسه و تعداد زیادی مثال برای توضیحش ذکر می کنه ولی کتاب جمع بندی مناسب یا پایه های علمی مستدل تری برای دفاع از خودش ندارهکتاب رو با صدای نویسنده گوش کردم و با وجود ضعف هاش گوش دادن به مثال ها و تحقیقات مختلف واقعا جالب بود. نکته دیگه این بود که دید جدیدی بهم داد و برای بیشتر خوندن در مورد تصمیم گیری کنجکاو شدم کتاب و صوتیش رو هم مثل همیشه اینجا گذاشتمAudiobooks are awesome!121!Exciting cutting edge neuroscience and psychology pitched at a level designed to drop a layman’s jaw!BLINK is about first impressions, unconscious thought, data accumulation at a glance, snap judgments and spontaneous, instantaneous high-speed decision making!In the first chapter, Gladwell summarizes his threefold purpose of writing the book. His first purpose was to convince readers that high speed decisions can be “every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.” His second purpose was to demonstrate that when those snap judgments and first impressions go off the rails, they do so for a very specific set of quite understandable reasons that are obvious enough on their face to allow decision makers to be on their guard when necessary. Gladwell’s final objective, obviously I dare say, was to convince readers that learning the difference and developing the skill of harking to those snap judgments when it’s appropriate to do so is a learnable skill.From first page to last, Gladwell’s descriptions of the science, the psychological tests that were used to bolster the scientific conclusions and the anecdotal examples of instances where snap judgments took the day or, ultimately, failed miserably were, in a word, gripping.For instance, Gladwell’s description of the degree to which facial movements are inextricably linked to emotions is mind-blowing. I dare you to NOT stop and shake your head in dumbfounded amazement when you read, “The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process.” Think about that for just a second. Facial expressions not only reflect emotions that already exist. They can create emotions and enhance or depress already existing feelings. You certainly won’t be hearing me expressing any disbelief when I read about a canny detective’s ability to pick up on kinesic “tells” about lying or information withholding during an interrogation any more.BLINK has lots and lots of succulent meat to chew on – recognition of forged artwork; wartime leadership and decision-making in the heat of battle; the differences between normal perception and autistic perception; judging on appearance; why Coca-Cola made the spectacularly flawed decision to create New Coke; a policeman’s near instantaneous decision to shoot a suspect; and much, much more.Highly recommended (and THAT, by the way, was NOT a snap decision!)Paul Weiss!121!I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe.!121!4 Stars for Blink: Power of Thinking Without Thinking (audiobook) by Malcolm Gladwell read by the author. This was a interesting look into making quick decisions. I think some of the author’s examples worked better than others.!121!مالکوم گلادول می‌آموزد که گاهی همانند ماجرای مجسمه‌ی کورو یا شبیه‌سازی جنگ، باید به حس خود اعتماد داشته باشیم و تجزیه و تحلیل اضافی جز خراب کردن تصمیممان، فایده‌ای ندارد.

A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars.!121!A must read - really interesting stories about how people process things unconsciously.  - for instance, you can't hide your feeling about race from your unconscious - take the Race Test (http://www.understandingprejudice.org...). It said I (and 13% of test-takers) have a 'moderate automatic preference for European American compared to African American'. It also said 48% of test-takers have a ""Strong automatic preference for White people"" - crazy! - I loved the bit about President Warren Harding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_H...), who - according to the author, basically got elected because he ""looked presidential"". I firmly believe looks matter - hey after all I do live in CA where we have the Governator...!121!3.4 starsMy interest in this book varied by chapter--by far the best one for me was ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx"" in part because I have a child with a diagnosis on the ""spectrum"" and in part because it answered my question as to why I now see police officers cruising by themselves (this is for an excellent reason, it turns out, but no spoilers as to why!) While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future.!121!I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary.!121!Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY.!121!From any psychologist's point of view, this book is full of contradicting psychological facts. Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies.!121!A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong.!121!1 Star - Horrible book.Against my better judgement I gave another one of Malcolm Gladwell's books a try. Oh, what precious reading time I wasted on this book! My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one.!121!ثاني كتاب أقرأه لنفس الكاتب... و مهم اللي بيقرا النوع ده من الكتب يدرك جيدا المقصود بالpop psychology... و مياخدش الكلام اللي في الكتاب علي انه حقائق علمية مثبتة... الكاتب بيسوق طبعا دراسات تدعم كلامه... بس هو بيسوقها بالذات للهدف ده: عشان تدعم كلامه... و ده لوحده لا يعني انها صحيحة او دقيقة... المهم الكتاب ده لافت للنظر بالفعل... بيتكلم عن الsnap judgements... ازاي عقلنا بيعرف حاجات معينة من غير ما احنا نعرفها... اللي ممكن نسميه الحدس... و امتي مناسب نستخدم الحدس ده و امتي ممكن الحدس يلبسنا في الحيطة... الرسالة الرئيسية في الكتاب من وجهة نظري ان الحدس ده سلاح ذو حدين... زي ما تبقي مربي كلب شرس... هيخدمك كتير و ممكن ين��ذ حياتك... بس مهم جدا انك تربيه كويس عشان متلاقيهوش في يوم بيعضك انت... تدريب الحدس ده محتاج نوع من الintrospection ... و الاهم محتاج بيئة صحية و ثرية مثيرة للتأمل و فيها ناس experts تتعلم منهم... عشان مهم جدا تعرف ان اللي مصاحب علي علوكة و اشرف كخة مش هيطلع طيار! 😁!121!Total Waste Of Timee,BorBorBoringgg!!","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Audiobook']"
When Breath Becomes Air (Kindle Edition),Paul Kalanithi,4.4,660566,2016,"For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","I finished the book and I'm glad that I perservered with it. It's quite an odd book and an overall rating might be the sum of the parts, but is not going to reflect the writing or content of those parts. Ratings, part I, 1 star, part II, 3 stars and part III, 5 stars.The first part, the foreword, by Abraham Verghese, was verbose, hagiographic and contradictory ie. full of shit. He said he didn't know the author at all until after his death. Then he says well he did meet him and they had a long email correspondence. And so it goes. He says it's the foreword but should be the afterword. Verghese must have sat there with a thesaurus composing endless sentences of praise for the author, who had, like most of us, never accomplished anything much out of the ordinary. I dnf'd this part and give it a whole, rounded-up 1 star.The second part, I feel churlish writing this, I really do. The author had an interesting career in his short life, mostly as a student. He had a MA in English Literature, another MA in History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, a BSc in Human Biology and finally an MD from Yale, before going on to be a neurosurgeon. It was in his brief career as a neurosurgeon and scientist he was diagnosed with cancer. He tried his best to be introspective and give guidance through the exponentially-increasing awfulness that is the journey through this dread disease. The problem was, he wasn't a natural writer although he'd wanted to be one all his life. His prose might have been just the stuff of essays at his Ivy League universities, but to me it was reminiscent of a writers' group where each attempt to outdo the other with portent-laden phrases and lots of deep literary references. It was tedious in parts. But... he did his best and he was a good doctor, husband and father, and this was only his debut book. Five stars for the man, but three stars, just, for this central section of the book.The long afterword was written by his widow. She is a doctor too, but could easily be a writer. She just has 'it' and her late husband, who wanted it so much, didn't. She rounds out the story he told, and continued on at length in the most interesting and well-written part of the book. Her ability to convey emotion without getting either lyrical or sappy was excellent. Five stars. Dr. Lucy Kalanithi should have been credited as co-author. I hope she goes on writing.It won't make sense to read the last part without the second, but you can easily skip the foreword, all it adds is unnecessary verbiage and lots of pages to make it look more than just the thin tome it really is.________________An example of the really rather awful writing that got me down. You may disagree, you may feel that the three words I suggest - dawn came up, are no substitute for the 150 poetic, lyrical, descriptive ones the author wrote instead. I'm too hard, right? ""And then we would sit and watch as the first hint of sunlight, a light tinge of day blue would leak out of the eastern horizon, slowly erasing the stars. The day sky would spread wide and high until the first ray of the sun made an appearance. The morning commuters began to animate the distant south Lake Tahoe roads but craning your head back you could see the day's blue darken halfway across the sky and to the west the night remained yet unconquered. Pitch black, stars in full glimmer, the full moon still pinned in the sky. To the east the full light of the day beamed toward you. To the west, night reigned with no hint of surrender. No philosopher can explain the sublime better than this, standing between day and night. It was as if this was the moment God said, ""Let there be light.""Very poetic, very beautiful image. So anyway, dawn came up.!121!As I finished this book with tears running down my face I asked myself, ""Why did you read this book? You know it was going to be sad, how could a man dying of lung cancer before the age of forty be anything but."" Yet to just classify this memoir, to classify this novel as such is to devalue the man he was. He was a lover of literature, a neurosurgeon, a scientist, a son and brother, a husband and father. He tried to live each day to the best of his ability, he helped many and he acknowledged the doctor patient relationship had a big disconnect with the reality of life, how their lives would change after being diagnosed with a serious illness. He was not a saint, he cried when given a death sentence, but his thoughts were not always for him, he always wanted to make sure his wife had a life after he was gone. So in many ways this was a profoundly beautiful read by a remarkable man. His wife says it best, ""What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.""!121!I don't think you should read this book because the story of an incredibly gifted man who had his life taken away at such a young age might give you the motivation to live life more fully. I think you should read this book because that talented, inspiring man has incredibly important things to say derived from his own experiences, and it's important to listen and learn from them. Read this book with the knowledge that you might not always be able to understand everything someone goes through, but you can set aside the time to listen to their story and hopefully give them the dignity and respect they deserve as a human being, in life or death. “Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” -Paul Kalanithi!121!Oh dear. I was always told not to speak ill of the dead. It feels awful to give a three star rating to a nice guy (by all accounts) who is now dead. But I simply did not find this book compelling or insightful enough. It is mildly interesting to learn about neurosurgery as a specialty and to read the author's thoughts as he faced diagnosis, illness and then death. I always felt that the author was holding back; that it was too clinical, too calm, just not passionate enough. The first time I felt that I was reading something worthwhile was in the 26 page epilogue by the author's wife. I guess the best way to say it is this; this is a quick read. And of course it should not be.!121!A gasping, desperate, powerful little book, bigger on the inside than outside. It's a little bit about dying, but more about being alive.!121!Do yourself a favour and don't listened to the ending of this book while doing your makeup...Theres no way to review a book where the author died too young from cancer leaving his wife and 8 months old baby behind without feeling like an asshole for not giving it 5 stars.That’s why more often than not, I don’t give a rating to the autobiographies I read. I just don’t feel comfortable rating someone’s life.Cancer and the death of a close one is something most of us unfortunately can relate to and I think it’s why this book got so popular.I’m glad the author was able to write this book since it was his dream but in my opinion the best part of it was the epilogue from his wife. I’m sure it’s where most of us ended up ugly crying.!121!""Death comes for all of us. For us, for our patients: it is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms.""Though 'When Breath Becomes Air' had been on my shelf for a while now, I've been going back and forth, unable to decide whether I should read this, as I was somewhat fearful of the impact this memoir might have on me. One must always brace himself/ herself when reading a book like this, for, you dive in knowing well about the inevitable heartbreaking ending. But, now that I'm finished, the only thing I regret is not reading the book sooner. Dr. Paul Kalanithi's insightful, beautiful and emotional memoir is something that everyone must read. ""What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?""The first half of the story is not what I had expected at all. Dr. Kalanithi starts from his childhood, little briefing about the family background and the turning points which directed him towards becoming a doctor, followed by the years in medical school. But what he focuses on most during the first half of the book is, the difficulties faced by a Resident, prior to graduation. The exhausting journey a Resident has to make is explained in a very captivating manner, allowing the reader to empathize with all medical professionals. This part of the book has been an eye-opener for me, for, never had I imagined it to be this much demanding. But it's not only that. He also goes on to describing moral/ ethical dilemmas one had to face, and the different ways each person deals with critical situations.""At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.""With the starting of second half, Dr. Kalanithi moves on to challenges he had to encounter after his diagnosis. The personal experiences are sometime quite overwhelming, navigating through an alternating curve where we continuously switch between hope and despair. Even with knowing the ending, it's difficult not to become hopeful that everything might get better and then stay that way. In my opinion, this latter half of the book is therapeutic for any reader, because, if one had already experienced a similar situation, they'll be able to relate and ease their pain at least a little, while others will understand the anguish and pain suffered by the patients and their families. The way you view people - not just the terminal patients, but any hardships faced by fellow human beings - will change profoundly.""I feared I was on the way to becoming Tolstoy's stereotype of a doctor, preoccupied with empty formalism, focused on the rote treatment of disease - and utterly missing the larger human significance.""Another thing that is going to surprise the readers is the beautiful use of language where Dr. Kalanithi's skills in literature and language really shines through. The narrative is not something one would expect from a doctor. Two main chapters are followed by the epilogue by Lucy Kalanithi, which is even more heartbreaking. But it is commendable how well she completes memoir, and delivering us this remarkable book. Reading preferences notwithstanding, I urge every reader to go through this book, at least once. It won't take you more than a couple of hours, but this book will profoundly change the way you see the world. Thank you, Dr. Paul Kalanithi, for your last, but most exceptional contribution to posterity.
""Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproductible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.""

""Yeah. Yeah, I like happy endings.""!121!Sharing this interesting New York Times interview with Dr. Lucy Kalanithi.She sounds like a very special person too:http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/hea...***********************************************Upgrading this to 5 stars, not sure why I didn't before***********************************************After finishing this profound, emotional memoir I feel like I lost a good friend.Thank you Paul Kalanithi for this beautiful gift you left for us, wherever you are...

Paul Kalanithi & Baby Cady during his last days of life

 Kalanithi with wife Lucy and Baby CadyI was going to try to write a longer review but my mind is not into it these days.All I can say this book will stay with me for a long time and everything good you've heard about how amazing it is it's more than well deserved.Sad, poignant, raw, beautiful...!121!I enjoy memoirs, but this one didn't grip me as much as others have, which is a shame considering how beloved this book seems to be. I admire Paul's resilience and passion for the world and his relationships, and I felt most compelled by his wife's conclusion towards the end when he couldn't complete his book. I think what kept me from being emotionally engrossed in this book was the writing. I would have appreciated more descriptions and storytelling about his experiences and relationships, rather than being told these things. There's lots of talk about finding the value in life, and I would have liked to read more scenes, examples, etc. to support those notions.!121!alternative title: ""How the upper class dies""Autobiographical book by a guy who's trained and studied all his life, nearly became a writer, then chose to become a doctor instead (that's what happens when you come from a family of medical doctors), and is diagnosed with cancer at the end of his training. Torschlusspanik [1] sets in and he has to write that one book he always wanted to write. It's partially an autobiography of his training, a hymn to his wife, and a bit on patient-doctor relationship.Sometimes it's way too pretentious for its own good, lots of classical lit, lots of poetry quotes, lots of namedropping - who on earth reads Wittgenstein to a newborn?? - and sometimes it's too sentimental and just straight-up walks into Tuesdays with Morrie territory. It is not an ugly death - for that the family is too well-trained in medicine to ""fight"" ultimately senseless fights, too well-acquainted with death to cause a fuss, too rich to die in a dump, too well-connected to suffer bad doctors.The last chapter written by the wife after his death is probably the best - still, I wouldn't recommend it, not much new, not that interesting [2]. Would make a good book for Oprah's Book Club.I can guarantee you that yours and my death will be much worse than what is described here. Here there is no constant vomiting, no blood, no mucus, no week-long screaming from the pain. Death is too clean, like the book itself.[1] One of the best words we have in German - literally ""gate closing panic"", it usually denotes a woman who starts to behave unusual once she realises that her child-bearing age window is closing, but it can be used to describe everyone who starts to behave unusual once time starts to run out[2] It feels extremely mean to write that about a guy's work who has just died!121!1/12/16: Update: Just wanted to mention that this book goes on sale today. Its an amazing story!Paul Kalanithi studied literature at Stanford University. For his thesis, he studied the work of Walt Whitman, a poet , who a century before, was possessed by the same questions that haunted him. Kalanithi wanted to find a way to understand and describe what he termed ""the Physiological-Spiritual Man."" Kalanithi had a passion for literature. He began to see language as an almost supernatural force, existing between people, bringing our brains, shielded in centimeter-thick skulls, into communion. ""There must be a way, I thought, that the language of life as experienced – – of passion, hunger, of love – – bore some relationship, however convoluted, to the language of neurons, digestive tracks, and heartbeats.""Paul Kalanithi's thesis was well-received -- but neuroscience as literary criticism didn't quite fit in the English Department. ( nor did he). There was a question he couldn't let go of. ""Where did Biology, morality, literature, and philosophy intersect?"".Kalanithi consulted a premed advisor - set aside his passion for literature - and figured out the logistics to get ready for medical school. He was still searching for answers to the question ""what makes human life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay?""When he was in his fourth year medical school, he watched many classmates choose to specialize in less demanding areas, (radiology or dermatology for example). It puzzled him that many students focused on lifestyle specialities--those with more humane hours, higher salaries, and lower pressures. For himself, he chose neurosurgery as a specialty. Kalanithi was diagnosed with Cancer. ( he actually was almost certain he had cancer many months before getting an X-Ray or MRI). Once it was clear that the cancer had invaded multiple organ systems--( ""severe illness wasn' life altering--it was life shattering""), decisions needed to be made. His wife Lucy, father, siblings, doctors were all involved - and chemo would start soon. Clarifying the rest of his life ( only age 36 at the time), was going to be a process. He and Lucy went to visit a sperm bank to preserve gametes and options. They had planned on having kids at the end of his residency. To think. Paul Kalanithi wrote this book - relentlessly- fueled with purpose during the last year of his life -- never got to finish his life's plan..( yet he still worked that last year).... But he was racing against time. With this book - he was hoping to confront death - examine it- accept it-- as a physician and a patient. He wanted to help other people understand death and face their mortality. ""It's not exotic..but tragic enough and imaginable enough he says"". There is a beautiful - but so sad- Epilogue by Lucy - from Paul's wife at the end of the book. Their baby had been born eight months before Paul died - March 9th, 2015. Lucy reports that Paul let himself be vulnerable and comforted by family and friends.. and even when terminally ill, he remained fully alive! Thank You Random House, Netgalley, and Paul ( and Lucy), Kalanithi!121!i like to wait to read popular books for so long they become modern classics.one, because usually it means they're good. and two, because then i can do this:there's no need to even review this. everyone on earth has read it, and there is a reason for that.bottom line: i love having popular opinions.!121!I read this almost two months ago and realized I never reviewed it. When I finished the book, I just couldn't review it. It's a small book, but it's powerful. I didn't shed any tears at the end of it, but I remember sitting there physically shaking and feeling really numb and tingly. A book has never impacted me that way before, and I'm not even sure why I read the book in the first place since I knew what I was getting myself into. Wait, I know why I wanted to read it. It was very therapeutic for me. I don't want to pull back the curtain too far on my life, but I've seen the havoc cancer causes out of nowhere in people's lives. People very close to me. I've held my grandmother's hand as she took her last breath after battling pancreatic cancer. My grandfather wasn't far behind her thanks to cancer in his lungs and throat. My dad has been battling colon cancer for the last two years. He's up and down. I think chemo does more bad than good. It's definitely taken its toll on him, but he's fighting. All this cancer and death hitting so close to home left me in this weird phase two years ago where I got to learn what a panic attack feels like. It's like having a heart attack, but not really, but close. It's scary. I think cancer blasting through my family while I was in the process of trying to move across the country just really shook me up. I still deal with the effects of it sometimes. I think God was just trying to show me there are some things in life I can't control. I can pick my job, my house, what to watch on Netflix, but I have no power over death or cancer or a heart attack or a car crash or any of it. YeahSo this book was helpful. I felt like I really connected with it and it was something I needed to read. You might not have quite the same reaction, but I still highly recommend reading it. Fiction is always great to escape the dark realities of the world we live in, but sometimes confronting those realities head on is extremely beneficial.!121!This is one of the best medical memoirs I have read. This book tells us about cancer both from a Doctor's perspective and a patient's perspective. Kalanithi's journey from a medical student into a Stanford Neurosurgeon will be an inspiring one for many. But it is the latter half of the book that tells you how to deal with a terminal illness that inspires you the most.

“There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.”!121!Okay, I so wanted to like this very absorbing book more than I did. I am not going to recap it other than to say that Paul came from a privileged background, a very supportive family and an Indian (Asian Tiger) mom. He succumbed to an aggressive form of lung cancer. My own wife died of lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). Outside of the hospital I was her caregiver for a year and a half. I was the one who made sure she had oxygen, got to her appointments, watched this once vital woman deteriorate, and held her hand in icu when she passed. Unlike Paul and Lucy, we did not stay together out of a sense of obligation because one of us was sick. Unlike Paul and Lucy we did not have an extended family to support us. Unlike Paul and Lucy we adopted. I went through this with her because I loved her. I never thought of another option even though she tried to persuade me once or twice that there might be other options. The book is very well written and Paul had a gift for including just the right amount of medical detail and jargon. He explains things precisely when explication as needed. The book flows smoothly from his childhood through Stanford and then Yale medical school. Paul according to himself is just about the best at whatever he undertakes and again according to himself he always takes care to score one more point than his closest competitor. He catalogues a list of the books he has read -- exclusively Western -- and drops a few favorite quotations from some. Strangely he makes no mention of Indian writing or writers or of the great Kiowa author Scott Momaday who matriculated at Stanford. Kinda too bad Paul did not read Momaday. If he had he might have understood the power and use of words better than he did.He becomes according to himself a wonderful neurosurgeon, probably the best ever although he does not reduce it to that exact description. He is decisive, fast, innovative and just an all around wonderful doctor.If you are getting the impression that he comes across as extremely self centered you broke the code. If you are getting the impression that he comes across as lacking real depth you not only broke the code you read between the lines.The book is very well written and at times absorbing, but it left me wondering, was that all there was to Paul and Lucy?!121!Never has a book turned me into a sad sobbing mess so quickly. Philosophical, beautiful, moving, difficult, heartbreaking. Highly, HIGHLY recommend.!121!‘even if im dying, until i actually die, i am still living.’
this memoir offers a very unique perspective on life and death, science and philosophy.as someone who also studied both literature and neuropsychology, i appreciate and completely relate to pauls outlook on how both are connected forces which drive life. his insights to what makes a life meaningful, the importance of purpose, and seeing humanity in people are good lessons to be taught. while not necessarily groundbreaking ideas at the core, its how he exemplifies these ideas in the context of his life and diagnosis that will serve as a good reminders to others to live life to the fullest.↠ 4 stars!121!""ALL ORDERS TEND TOWARDS ENTROPY"" This is the story of the perception and management of life and death (both separately and together) of a 36 year old doctor nearing the completion of his neurosurgery training when he got diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer. Being a person on the path of being a surgeon, having a love for books, philosophy, literature, writing and a thirst to know deeper meaning for life, I felt I could understand the author very well, somehow! The parts regarding a surgeon's hectic schedule, the heavy burden of patients' wellness and care and the thorough explanation of surgical procedures proved to be like my own normal routine and consequently made me feel more at home with this man's philosophies and researches for whatever he was looking for out there in this whole wide universe!Paul had a passion to fully grab the meaning and purpose of life, death and human existence and this love took him on an adventurous journey first through literature, then through medicine and finally both!“Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.” He found that no matter how much close to a patient a doctor was during his illness, he could never grasp the true meaning of his suffering since he could never be in his shoes!This book shows how fragile life is to spoil the long hours of hard work and fail you in achieving your goals, how unpredictable it can be to divert you from the path that so definitely was leading you towards your dreams just in the previous moment.This book shows how life is to be lived, how death is to be welcomed and how much effort it takes to have the integrity to look them both in the eye, fight with dignity and come out a winner, despite losing your breaths in the battle! Tears welled up in my eyes while reading the part when despite having a weakening body, this man invested enough energy to gain unlimited happiness during the moments of delivery of his daughter. He taught us that vulnerability is not weakness. It takes real strength to reveal your vulnerable side. It is in the weakest moments that a man can be the strongest, never knowing he could endure all that pain.This book opens our eyes to our mortality. That our time in this universe is limited. That love and knowledge are immortal tools that we can use to our aid to make our stay on this planet infinite.Finally this book teaches us how the pain and suffering could be reduced by the undying love, affection and care of one's family. That life is not lived in years. Even in the smallest amount of time, we can create valuable and immortal memories.“Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” The book is written in simple and honest language yet it touches the deepest parts of heart and mind. Being written by a man who had a limited time frame and a vast knowledge and understanding of the human miseries and their connections with the beginning, mid and end of the story called life, I would not like to judge it harshly. Just having the courage enough to write a book with such influence on readers is a feat worth praising!The sadness I felt, after knowing that we have lost one of the best neurosurgeons and a visionary, affectionate human being who could do so much with his talent and compassion to reduce the sufferings of the world, was immense!""Only 0.0012% of 36-year-olds get lung cancer. ""The dilemma???He had to be the one!5 starts!Highly recommended!!121!Ahh SUCH A GOOD BOOK. I cried so hard at the end. This story is so heartbreaking yet took me on such a range of emotions from hope to appreciation to anger to sadness. I truly think everyone should read this book.!121!Unforgettable is what Verghese says in his foreword. I agree and am fighting for my own breath to write my thoughts about this stunning memoir that has left me gasping for air. The writing. The emotion. The beauty in the darkness of dying. I mourn the death of this writer, a surgeon of great potential. A doctor of great compassion. But the message he has left us is quite eloquently simple: make life as meaningful as you can in the time you have. Be grateful. The touching epilogue his wife Lucy wrote.My tears runneth over. 5⭐️ - have upped this. This one will stay with me for a long while.!121!I'm sorry Paul Kalanithi died. I'm sorry he had to struggle through something so horrible. I'm sorry that the world lost a clearly brilliant, passionate neurosurgeon. But just once, I'd like to read a cancer memoir from someone without privilege. Without education, without wealth, without the best treatment in the world at their fingertips. I want to hear of the person who is NOT going to leave a legacy behind, whose ego is not so ballooned that the foreword describes their mediocre prose as ""spun gold."" I have learned nothing, except that some people's stories get told, and many times those are not the stories I want to hear.!121!I can't express enough my admiration for this book, for Paul Kalanithi himself.Thank you Paul, thank you for showing us what is life really about.I hope you found the meaning of life and death, the one you searched endlessly.Sir, you will be remembered.!121!همین الان این کتاب رو تموم کردم که دارم این ریویو رو می‌نویسم. ترجیح دادم نوشتنش بلافاصله باشه تا شاید بتونم حتی شده بخش کوچیکی از حسم نسبت به این کتاب رو انتقال بدم.خوندن این کتاب رو تموم کردم و قلبم فشرده شده و در عین حال از هیجان می‌کوبه. فشردگی از غم و هیجان از آموخته‌های لذتبخش و سهیم شدن در جهان‌بینی عمیق یک انسانِ به واقع انسان.قصد داشتم کتاب رو جرعه جرعه بخونم تا لذت خوندنش برام تا مدتی ادامه پیدا کنه و بتونم بیشتر مست بشم و عمیق‌تر بهره ببرم اما خب افسوس که وقتی به چیزی بیش از اندازه لذتبخش می‌رسیم اختیار رو از دست می‌دیم و من محو شدم و مست شدم و کتاب رو تا آخر سر کشیدم.تا حالا به کتابی برخوردین که بتونه ترکیب دقیقی از عشق، معنا، هیجان، فلسفه، معنویت، علم، تجربه و هر آنچه تو کتاب‌های مختلف دنبالش می‌گردیم رو بتونه یک جا تو خودش جا بده و به بهترین نحو در اختیار خواننده بذاره؟ اگر بله لطفا به من معرفیش کنین چون این اولین بار بود که با کتاب آن هنگام که نفس هوا می‌شود تجربه‌ش می‌کردم...داستان در مورد یک متخصص مغز و اعصابه که تو جوونی و دهه سی سالگی با سرطان مواجه می‌شه. پال خودش این کتاب رو نوشته و به صورت عمیق و موثری دیدگاهش نسبت به زندگی رو بیان کرده، نه فقط در خلال سرطانش، بلکه قبل از اون نیز.من فکر می‌کنم ما وقتی می‌تونیم خوب زندگی کنیم که مرگ رو همیشه در گوشه‌ی ذهنمون داشته باشیم و فکر کردن به مرگ ذهن ما رو آگاه و فعال نگه می‌داره و کمک می‌کنه در عین برنامه داشتن برای آینده، تو زمان حال زندگی کنیم. این کتاب به ما درک عمیق‌تری از زندگی و حتی مرگ می‌ده و حاوی تلنگرهای زیادیه برای فراتر رفتن از دغدغه‌های روزمره‌ای که شاید زندگی کردن رو از یادمون برده.این کتاب یکی از بهترین کتاب‌هایی بود که تو تمام زندگیم خوندم و قطعا تو مقاطع مختلف زندگیم باز هم خواهم خوندش. کاش می‌تونستم از پنج بهش صد بدم!به نظرم هر کس تو زندگیش باید حداقل یک بار این کتاب رو بخونه...پال کالانیتی همیشه یکی از شخصیت‌های اثرگذار و الهام‌بخش تو زندگیم خواهد موند.----------یادگاری از کتاب:هرگز آن قدر عاقل نیستیم که در این لحظه زندگی کنیم....شاید پوزو بکت درست می‌گوید. شاید زندگی فقط یک لحظه است. کوتاه‌تر از آن که تصور کنی....چه چیزی به زندگی آن‌قدر معنا می‌دهد که ارزش ادامه دادن داشته باشد؟...بیشتر آدم‌ها با بی‌اعتنایی نسبت به مرگ زندگی می‌کنند؛ اتفاقی است که برای تو و همه اطرافیانت رخ می‌دهد....- اگر تا حدی می‌دانستم چه‌قدر زمان برایم باقی مانده راحت‌تر بود. اگر دو سال وقت داشتم می‌نوشتم. اگر ده سال، سراغ جراحی و علم برمی‌گشتم.+ می‌دانی که نمی‌توانم بهت عدد بدهم....کسب تجربه‌های غنی و بعد خلوت گزیدن برای تفکر و نوشتن درباره‌ی آن‌ها....مرگ را مثل یک مسافر دوره‌گرد باابهت می‌دیدم اما می‌دانستم حتی اگر در حال مردن باشم، تا وقتی بمیرم، همچنان زندگی خواهم کرد....بخش پیچیده‌ی بیماری این است که، همانطور که آن را از سر می‌گذرانی ارزش‌هایت مدام تغییر می‌کند. سعی می‌کنی بفهمی چه چیزی برایت اهمیت دارد، بعد همینطور به فهمیدن آن ادامه می‌دهی....ما همگی خویشتن‌های متفاوتی را در زمان و مکان‌های متفاوت زندگی می‌کنیم....به تدریج بالا خواهیم رفت و به قله‌ی تپه‌های بی‌کران خواهیم رسید، جایی که بادها سردند و چشم‌اندازها بی‌نظیر.!121!Paul Kalanithi is thirty six and so close to finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he finds out he has stage IV lung cancer. As an undergraduate Kalanithi studied English literature and his love of reading and writing had been a constant through out his life. He had always felt that when he was older he would like to write and had decided to focus on neurosurgery for now, where he could make a bigger difference by saving people's lives. All his hopes and dreams for the future were suddenly unrealistic as an upper limit of a handful of years was put onto his life. Kalanithi pens this memoir, dealing with the struggles of facing death and having to go from being able to save others lives to now be the one staring down mortality. The writing was excellent but reading this memoir was so depressing. Just the fact that someone so brilliant was going to die and not be able to keep contributing when they clearly had so much to offer. I was disappointed by where the book left off but then I read the afterword to find out that he had died before he could even finish the memoir which just made it twenty times worse. Death is inevitable but like Kalanithi acknowledges we don't really think about it as being imminent and so it's not the same as when you're terminal and trying to make peace with dying. I just found it so hard to read him struggling to make sense of how to best use the rest of his time especially since there was no way for him to know how limited it really was. Also the fact that he didn't get to see more of his daughter and watch her grow up. It was just depressing honestly, well written but I just felt sad and I don't know what else to say. It just feels unfair because I wish I was even a fraction as smart or eloquent but I'm not but I get to live and he doesnt.!121!I expect the author was actually a much nicer guy than he comes across as being in this book. However throughout the book he tells us again and again that he was the smartest kid in school, that he got into Stanford AND Yale and was the best med student and the best med students become surgeons and the best surgeons become neurosurgeons, so of course he became a neurosurgeon. And then... became the BEST neurosurgeon - chief resident at a top hospital. And wait there's more: he's also well- read and illustrates this by throwing in frequent quotes from literature. It is unfortunate the author spent so much time cataloging his accomplishments when actually he had an interesting story: a young man thought he had most of his life ahead of him and was suddenly faced with a mortal illness. A more introspective story might have explored how this sudden reversal of fortune affected his inner life, relationships, and values. But this is not an introspective story and only touches on such things in a very superficial way. Perhaps the most interesting question here arises from the backstory. Why does a young man when faced with a deadly disease remain narcissistically focussed on his own accomplishments? Is this the price to be paid for an upbringing that reminds us of the ""the Namesake"" and the ""Tiger Mother?""But none of these ideas are explored and unfortunately the book becomes a not very interesting story about a promising career cut short and a too-early death.!121!“The thing about lung cancer is that it’s not exotic,” Paul wrote in an email to his best friend, Robin. “It’s just tragic enough and just imaginable enough. [The reader] can get into these shoes, walk a bit, and say, ‘So that’s what it looks like from here…sooner or later I’ll be back here in my own shoes.’

My thoughts a few pages into this book was that I could never write a memoir because then I would have to publish it and it would be as if everyone could have access to my diary. Then my thoughts more than halfway through the book was that to write a memoir, you must have something really awe-inspiring to write about and you must have lived and more importantly, loved.All of Paul's achievements had enlightening moments to them and to me, the biggest uplifting success of Paul was being able to pin down all these moments throughout his challenges, hectic schedules and treatments. He wanted to teach us to ask more questions whether it was in literature or medicine or life but also not get so caught up in the questioning that we forgot to live in the moments with our people. ❤️***first nonfiction in a long time :) please don’t disappoint🤞🏽!121!Wow. I had to wait a little bit to pull myself together before writing a review of this exquisite book, even though I am tremendously late to the party on this one.""...See what it is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone, by your words. In a world of asynchronous communication, where we are so often buried in our screens, our gaze rooted to the rectangular objects buzzing in our hands, our attention consumed by ephemera, stop and experience this dialogue with my young departed colleague, now ageless and extant in memory. Listen to Paul.""Paul Kalanithi was, by all accounts, an excellent neurosurgeon, with the potential of being a true guiding force in medicine and science. He spent most of his early adult life seeking knowledge on multiple fronts, from literature and science to philosophy and ethics. When he finally decided to pursue a career in neurology, he wasn't just content to be a doctor—he wanted to understand and identify with his patients fully, to help them and their families adjust to whatever their new reality would be following a diagnosis, an accident, a surgery.""I was pursuing medicine to bear witness to the twinned mysteries of death, its experiential and biological manifestations: at once deeply personal and utterly impersonal.""At the age of 36, Paul was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer. Suddenly his life has transformed him from doctor to patient, not an easy transition for anyone, especially someone as hands-on with patient care as Paul had been. While he and his internist wife Lucy are prepared for the worst, Paul's oncologist has hope, and doesn't allow him to wallow in his diagnosis. If he wants to stop being a neurologist, she tells him, it has to be because he doesn't want to continue or wants to pursue something else—his cancer won't stop him.As he struggles with thoughts of his future, however long that might be, he ponders how to fill that time. Should he continue working in a field that has so richly given back to him, and given him the chance to touch so many lives? What gives a life value, and how can that value be measured? What obligations does he owe his family, his friends, his wife, his infant daughter?""At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.""
When Breath Becomes Air
 is an intellectual and deeply emotional memoir, written by a young man with so much promise, so much heart, so much empathy. It is both a reflection on coming face-to-face with one's own mortality and a commentary on the responsibility doctors have to help their patients and their families through that same reflection, whether it happens with some warning or suddenly. It is also a love story, of a man and his wife, a man and the child he will never truly know, and a man and his career.You know from the very start of Abraham Verghese's introduction to the book that Paul lost his battle with cancer, yet the end of his life, and the epilogue written by Paul's wife still feel like sucker punches. You mourn a man you probably never knew, but you feel truly blessed he chose as one of his final acts to share his life, his death, and his thoughts with the world, because we are all better for them.""'The thing about lung cancer is that it's not exotic,' Paul wrote in an email to his best friend, Robin. 'It's just tragic enough and just imaginable enough. [The reader] can get into these shoes, walk a bit and say, 'So that's what it looks like from here...sooner or later I'll be back here in my own shoes.' That's what I'm aiming for, I think. Not the sensationalism of dying, and not exhortations to gather rosebuds, but: Here's what lies up ahead on the road.' Of course, he did more than just describe the terrain. He traversed it bravely.""This is a beautiful book, truly a work of art that I won't soon forget. Easily one of the finest books I've read in some time. My thanks to the Kalanithi family, and Paul himself, for this opportunity to view such an exceptional man at such a critical juncture in his life. See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo....!121!“Thank you for loving me.”My heart is full! I was not expecting for this book to have the impact on me that it did. What a beautiful account of a man who truly lived his life to the fullest, despite dying quite young. He gave an incredible and resilient narrative on dealing and living with lung cancer and it unexpectedly shortening your life, but fighting through it despite all odds. Creating a new life, a new dream in that present moment and not letting the prospect of death stop you from living a life full of passion and hope. This is a story we can all learn from. An all-time favourite.!121!""To begin with -- or, maybe, to end with --I got to know Paul only after his death. I came to know him most intimately when he'd ceased to be."" (Abraham Verghese)And we, for the most part, can actually say the same thing about Paul Kalanithi. We've come to know of him only after he had left this world of ours. Ironically, I write this on March 9th, the one-year anniversary of his passing.Paul Kalanithi: son, husband, father, brilliant surgeon. He was a healer whose very existence gave hope to so many. How can this be? In my humble opinion, I believe that we are here on this earth for the appointed time of our being. We draw no more breath than what is pre-determined by a Higher Being....be it the last, raspy breaths of the elderly or the sole breath of a dying newborn. Paul was here for his personal alloted time.This book is divided into two sections: before cancer diagnosis and after cancer diagnosis. Many have expressed a disconnect after having read this story. Many were looking for the gentle words of the dying in philosophical terms. The little nuggets were indeed there. But the perspective was all Paul's.The beginning of the book was both clinical and procedural. That was Paul revealing his sense of ""being""......what it took to become this focused man of medicine and of science. His steps were measured in the direction of his accomplishments and towards the light of a future that was never meant to be.The second part of the book concentrated on the shifting of his identity from directing physician to the role of dependent patient. His profound knowledge of medicine served him in a limited capacity as he fought against the aggression of the disease. ""But I'd had no idea how hard it would be, how much terrain I would have to explore, map, settle."" Much like the rest of us in our stilted human experience.The Epilogue is beautifully written by his wife, Lucy. She writes: ""his transformation, from life to death, the ultimate transformation that awaits us all.""When Breath Becomes Air should not be taken as a maudlin reading, but one of hope and one of living a life well, no matter what the promise of longevity reveals.!121!I enjoyed this memoir and can see why so many people applauded it when it first came out. Paul Kalanithi’s writing is straightforward and evocative at the same time. For a man approaching his own death, he crafted this memoir in a way that doesn’t feel overly sentimental yet still captures the love he has for his profession, his family, and for literature and writing. I felt immersed in several parts of When Breath Becomes Air, ranging from Kalanithi’s journey to discovering neurosurgery as his true passion as well as the raw details he included both about his practice of neurosurgery and his own illness. I feel like contemporary society in the United States can be averse to openly naming, processing, and honoring death, so I appreciated this book for encouraging us to reflect on what actually matters in life beyond everyday stressors or more insignificant worries. When reading When Breath Becomes Air, I thought about my best friends and my own passion for healing work and art.My main critique of this memoir is that at times it felt like Kalanithi was participating in glorifying or giving a pass to toxic work cultures within the field of medicine? For example, at one point he wrote about how he noticed some of his colleagues opting for careers in less stressful medical disciplines like dermatology or radiology. The tone he used in this section of the book felt a bit condescending – I think it’s totally fair for people to want a career where they can live healthy lives physically and mentally, spend time with their friends and families, devote time to hobbies, etc. At one point he wrote about how the difference between a job/career and a calling, and how because he perceived neurosurgery as his calling, he was willing to endure overwork even to the detriment of his health and the quality of his marriage. I felt turned off by this language because I feel like something should be able to be your calling *and* you should be able to live a healthy life outside of that calling too. Overall, a quick and impactful read. While I respect that Kalanithi wrote what felt most authentic for him, I wish he had avoided glorifying overwork in medicine, especially given the worrying rates of mental health problems and deaths by suicide by doctors, including one of Kalanithi’s own former colleagues who he wrote about in this book.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography']"
Bossypants (Kindle Edition),Tina Fey,3.96,1001587,2011,"Before Liz Lemon, before ""Weekend Update,"" before ""Sarah Palin,"" Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.She has seen both these dreams come true.At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.","Tina Fey's Bossypants was a disappointment. I don't know that expecting much from a comedy writer's cash-in big-font-with-pictures essay/memoir...thing...is fair, but I've been a Tina Fey fan since 30 Rock began, ready to trust her literary aspirations, and even to me this book barely scratches onto the two star plateau.What did I expect? Well, it's probably easier to explain what I didn't expect. I wasn't counting on a sour, muddled, defensive screed against anyone who pissed off the author in the last thirty years. I wasn't hoping for forced, obvious stories about the professional discrimination in Fey's history. I wasn't looking forward to insecure ramblings about the long hours she put into Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock. And I definitely wasn't expecting all of the above to be sugarcoated by a combination of weak, insecure meta-analysis and self-conscious “oh, I'm really not that great” coverups. You know why Bossypants bugged me? Tina Fey has nothing for which to apologize. She's smart, she's funny, and she's talented. So I assume this book had some sort of cathartic impact and she needed to get this bile out of her system. Bossypants gets credit for three short, quality sections. First, Fey tackles the “what's that scar on your face?” question right up front and follows with some funny, interesting commentary on how she can gauge people by how they respond to the scar. Second, she answers a few critical emails/blog comments as a “question and answer” chapter. Third, she walks the reader through a detailed analysis of the whole “I look like Sarah Palin” era. I read this book quickly, over two nights, and while Bossypants is well-written, for the most part, the subject matter's dour nature left me cold, oh, 75% of the time.Listen. I didn't pick this book up whispering, under my breath, “Make me laugh right NOW, Tina Fey! Dance, monkey, dance!” But I feel like Tina Fey wrote this book for 1) young women she's trying to inspire, and 2) all the people who hate her who will never read this book, anyway. Maybe 41 year old white guys weren't her target audience. I can live with that. I'll still watch 30 Rock, though, and not just because she's hot. I just hope next time Fey writes a better book.!121!The best audiobook I've listened to in a long, long time. And that's saying something. I ended up picking this up because when I sent up a signal flare on Twitter, it was the most recommended book by far. Now I see why. 1. The narration was exceptionally good. (I like autobiography being read by the author, but not all authors are good narrators.) 2. It's legitimately funny. 3. It's legitimately thoughtful and insightful. I'll also say that I read this book cold. I didn't really know who Tina Fey was when I picked it up. I had a dim awareness of her being one of the SNL people, and an actress. But that's it. I also didn't know she was in charge of 30 Rock. (A show I've seen exactly one episode of.) So I didn't come into this book as a fan. I became a fan by listening to it.I'm probably one of the few people that's going to start watching the show because of the book, rather than the other way around. I suspect that some of the low-to-mediocre ratings on here might come from people who were expecting her personal voice to be more like that of the character she plays. That understandable (but unreasonable) expectation probably caused them some disappointment. Also, the book has some feminist leanings. And that's going to piss some people off, even if they don't admit it. More's the pity.!121!I'm listening to the audiobook and it's even better than the print.!121!A somewhat interesting and funny audiobook memoir.  ""Bossypants"" is a little memoir about the joys and setbacks through Tina Fey’s life. From childhood to adulthood; and her crazy family life. From her first jobs to SNL and 30 Rock; and her beginnings in comedy. Tina goes through a variety of serious and not so serious subjects, sometimes even random; but almost always through humor. It was a very nice touch to have this on Audiobook and hear it from Tina herself.Certainly entertaining and funny, to an extent. I knew Fey to be a comedian, writer in SNL, and creator of Mean Girls. This memoir would have probably been a lot nicer if I had ever watched at least an episode of SNL or 30 Rock, something still not happening to this day. I’m also not a fan of political humor, which is abundant in many occasions. I think this would totally hit it with any SNL fan, so if that’s your case, you may want to check this one out, or Amy Pohler’s “Yes Please”.Overall I liked it, but it is not one of my most memorable reads. I cherish some very funny bits, some tips about professional and family life, and some very interesting knowledge about the hardships of the comedian’s life. And maybe a thing or two more. -----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2011] [283p] [Memoir] [Audiobook] [Not Recommendable] [Comedian life is hard] [She is funny] [Yes Please!] -----------------------------------------------Una algo interesante y graciosa memoria en audiolibro.  ""Bossypants"" es una pequeña memoria sobre los placeres y pesares a través de la vida de Tina Fey. Desde su infancia hasta la adultez; y su alocada vida familiar. Desde sus primeros trabajos hasta SNL y 30 Rock; y sus inicios en la comedia. Tina trata una variedad de temas serios y no tan serios, a veces incluso aleatorios; pero casi siempre a través del humor. Fue un toque muy lindo tener esto en Audio y poder escucharlo directamente de la mismísima Tina.Ciertamente entretenida y graciosa, hasta cierto punto. Sabía que Fey era una comediante, escritora de SNL, y creadora de Mean Girls. Esta memoria probablemente hubiera sido mucho más linda si hubiera visto alguna vez al menos un capítulo de SNL o 30 Rock, cosa que hasta el día de hoy todavía no sucede. Tampoco soy fan del humor político, el cual es abundante en varias ocasiones. Creo que esto la pegaría totalmente con un fan de SNL, así que si ese es tu caso, tal vez deberías chequear esto, o “Yes Please” de Amy Pohler.Dentro de todo me gustó, pero desafortunadamente no es una de mis lecturas más memorables. Adoro varias partes muy graciosas, ciertos consejos sobre la vida profesional y familiar, y algunos conocimientos muy interesantes sobre la difícil vida del comediante. Y tal vez alguna que otra cosa más.-----------------------------------------------
NOTA PERSONAL
: [2011] [283p] [Memoria] [Audiolibro] [No Recomendable] [La vida del comediante es difícil] [Ella es graciosa] [Yes Please!] -----------------------------------------------!121!I honestly cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard reading anything (only a Jonathan Tropper novel or a Dave Sedaris collection comes close). I finished the other night with wet cheeks from the tears that'd escaped my eyes. The bed had been shaking I was laughing so hard! So what's to love about ""Bossypants,"" besides everything? For starters, how Tina just tells it (and by ""it,"" I mean everything from working at SNL to impersonating Sarah Palin) like it is. She's got a fierce feminist streak in her, but it's a feminism that exhibits itself in her trademark no-bullshit kind of way. It's more or less the message of, ""I will be who I want to be and I do not care if you like it"". Oh, and she's quick to call other women out for being catty — while, at the same time, being the first to admit she's played that card plenty of times in her own past.And that, perhaps, is what makes Tina Fey so gosh darn likable. She IS us, right down to admitting her faults. You have to laugh reading chapters like ""Amazing, Gorgeous, Not Like That"" (in which Tina breaks down what a photo shoot is REALLY like) because you think, ""YES! That is exactly what I thought it'd be like!"" What I loved most about this book is Tina's voice can be heard through the whole thing. That's not an easy thing for an author to do, but you feel as though Tina is reading these stories to you (fan girl I am, I still want the audio version so, you know, Tina actually CAN read these stories to me!)Personal highlights: • The chapter on her dad, ""That's Don Fey"" (""How can I give [my daughter] what Don Fey gave me? The gift of anxiety. The fear of getting in trouble. The knowledge that while you are loved, you are not above the law."")• Her chapters on being very very skinny and being a little bit fat— brilliant essays on women and weight shared in a way I think only she could nail. • She has a girl crush on Amy Poehler and a work crush on Alec Baldwin (whom she gives way too much credit for the success of 30 Rock, IMO).• She refuses to hire/work for jerks and she's not above using this book to get revenge on those who've criticized women's ability to be funny (on the success of the Sarah Palin-Hilary Clinton sketch she did with Amy: ""That night's show was watched by 10 million people and I guess that director at The Second City who said the audience ""didn't want to see a sketch with two women"" can go shit in his hat."")• She writes lines that seriously just make you bust a gut: ""Do I think Photoshop is being used excessively? Yes. I saw Madonna's Louis Vutton ad and honestly, at first glance, I thought it was Gwen Stefani's baby.""• The chapter on her attempt to film a scene with Oprah, play Sarah Palin for the first time on SNL and plan her daughter's 3rd Peter Pan-themed birthday party (""By the way, when Oprah Winfrey is suggesting you may have overextended yourself, you need to examine your f*cking life"")• Her thoughts on parenthood and struggling to breastfeed and why she refuses to take guilt from (her words, not mine) ""Teat Nazis""• And finally, a chapter that struck a chord with me in those final pages, ""The Mother's Prayer For Its Daughter,"" because, dang it all, Tina does what so few can and it's write something that can be so beautifully poetic and LOL funny at the same time. (""First, Lord: No tattoos. May neither Chinese symbol for truth nor Winnie-the-Pooh holding the FSU logo stain her tender haunches."")So yeah, it's brilliant. It's hilarious. JUST GO READ IT ALREADY! haha!121!Big Tina Fey fan here. I have always enjoyed her work on SNL and have seen almost every episode of 30 Rock. I have seen some of her movies, not all. She is very definitely funny and smart. Her Sarah Palin kills. So what might one expect from a Tina Fey book? One of two things, either a straight ahead comedic book with plenty of anecdotes, jokes and maybe a bit of behind-the-scenes info, or a personal memoir, with detail about her background. I felt that Fey committed to neither fully and wound up producing half of both in a book that was inconsistent and at times very thin.After reading this book, do you feel that you know Fey any better than you did before? Sure there are some details about this and that, and she does address internal conflicts around work-vs-family, but my take is that this was all very surfacy material and did not really get much, if at all, below the skin. As a memoir I found it very unrevealing. There is the matter of the scar. She tells us nothing. And tunes out those who ask. Doesn’t it make you think there is something there? A little kid is harmed so violently and she has nothing to say about it? Really? Had no effect on her growing up? Another sore point was the minimal info offered on her relationship with her father, Don Fey, who was clearly a very powerful figure in her life. Colin Quinn, having just met the guy, was impressed. “Your father doesn’t fucking play games. You would never come home with a shamrock tattoo in that house.” Yet TF offers us very little about him and virtually nothing about how his personality affected her growing up. There was definitely some fun behind-the-scenes material here, most especially in her chapter on staff urination practices. I felt that her portrait of life in Second City was thin. Re 30 Rock, nothing on Alec Baldwin, really? We assume that they got to know each other when he hosted SNL, but how did it come to be that she wanted to write a sit-com that he starred in? Nada. Thin. But plenty of respect and admiration for Lorne Michaels and several of her workmates. That offered at least a hint of heft.Some chapters function mostly as short comedic bits. In one she responds to hostile e-mails that certainly could have been real, although one wonders. But real or written it was rather low-hanging fruit.She does allow some warts to dot the portrait. Basically stealing a job from a lifer at the Y was a pretty crappy thing to do in her early years. It makes one see TF as someone who gets what she wants no matter who she hurts. And she certainly seems to have had a remarkable run of success. One wonders if there are more wounded and dying left on the field of battle. How much has luck played a part in her achievements? In terms of how she functions in the world as a competitive person I felt that we got only the very tip of the TF iceberg.She points out more than a few of the gender-bias barricades she and other female writers and comedians have had to hurdle. That was one of the strengths of the book, as was her conflicted feelings about parenting versus work. Many years ago I knew a fellow who worked at one of the main New York comedy clubs. He made it pretty clear that, as a group, comedians were “not nice people.” Tina Fey may or may not be a nice person. I did not get a strong enough sense to overcome my predisposition. She is certainly very smart, talented and funny. I would like to know more about her, but this book is not the goto source for that. My sense is that TF is not gonna let anyone too close, not show too much, other than to her best buds and family, and who knows, maybe not even them. In a way, I felt the book resembled SNL. In pretty much every production of the show, there are some good bits and some that fall flat. I expect there are more publications ahead for Fey. Hopefully the next one will offer a better overall product, with heftier content. PS - One quote I particularly enjoyed:When I was a kid there was a TV interstitial during Saturday morning cartoons with a song that went like this: “The most important person in the whole wide world is you, and you hardly even know you."" You’re the most important person! Is this not the absolute worst thing you could instill in a child? They’re the most important person? In the world? That’s what they already think. You need to teach them the opposite. They need to be a little afraid of what will happen.I'm with you on this one, sister.!121!Tina Fey. American Icon. 
Some people say, “Never let them see you cry.” I say, if you’re so mad you could just cry, then cry. It terrifies everyone.
I really appreciated how this memoir had a good mix of heartwarming anecdotes, comedic happenstances and career musings. While I am not as familiar with her SNL and early career, this book was fun and easy to listen to.As with many a memoir, we start with her childhood love of comedy  and processed to her current-day adventures (or perhaps more accurately: misadventures). A running theme to this book was the importance of being yourself: 
Do your thing and don't care if they like it.
As a young teen, Tina hung out  primarily in the theater department - thus having the pleasure of getting to know all sorts of quirky characters while being a social pariah to the rest of the school. But to her, the friendships and life lessons were invaluable to shaping her future. So, despite what others may have said, there was no way she would have lived her life differently. After all, 
Gay people don’t actually try to convert people. That’s Jehovah’s Witnesses you’re thinking of.
Her early career was sporadic and difficult - breaking into the comedy scene was no easy task but she made it - by being bossy and taking no sh*t from no one. I enjoyed how she managed to inject her personal brand of humor throughout her memoir while simultaneously opening up to her real problems and issues:
My ability to turn good news into anxiety is rivaled only by my ability to turn anxiety into chin acne.
 If you are looking for a light read with great advice - look no further!Audiobook CommentsTina read this one and absolutely rocked it. The comedic time was just superb. I'd definitely take listening to this book over reading it any day.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!Sure, you could read Bossypants. Provided you like all that self-deprecating ""I'm Tina Fey and I am enormously successful and I am thankful for that, but at the same time I still struggle with being a working woman with a real life, because it is so weird that I am a media icon when I still really think of myself as an unpopular high school theater dweeb, and isn't life weird, like when I was seen as a major influence during the last election because I kind of look like Sarah Palin?"" stuff.Personally, Tina Fey is a little too successful for me. I don't like it. I want to read about the life of someone else in order to feel better about my own life, not to make me wish I lived in New York and did something cool for a living.I'd rather read the autobiography of Liz Lemon. Tina Fey tries to pretend there's still a Liz Lemon inside of her, but there so totally isn't. Liz Lemon, however, will never write a biography, because 1) she doesn't exist and 2) there is no ""life sadness"" section at Barnes & Noble (unless you count Romance, amirite guys?).So instead, I've collected some of her wisdom here, touching on every aspect of life, as taken from the popular television series 30 Rock.Dating & Marriage[Man walks up to Liz at the bar]Gentleman: Excuse me, is this seat taken?Liz: Really, dude? I got to move my coat? There are like four empty seats over there! Can't you just be cool?[Man leaves]Jenna: That guy wanted to buy you a drink!Liz: Really? But I already have a drink. Do you think he'd buy me mozzarella sticks?Liz: I'm going to tell Drew that I'm having a little welcome to the building party for him but there is no party and then when he shows up I'll laugh and say ""oh it's the wrong night"" and then he'll laugh and say one glass couldn't hurt and then I will put my mouth on his mouth! Liz: Just embrace the fact that you are lucky enough to be a happily married man. I mean, I'm actually jealous of you. You've got stability, a great marriage, devoted kids. You know what I have? A Sims family that keeps getting murdered.ReligionTracy: So what's your religion, Liz Lemon?Liz: I pretty much just do whatever Oprah tells me to. BusinessJack: Lemon, I'm impressed. You're beginning to think like a businessman.Liz: A businesswoman.Jack: I don't think that's a word.Jack: The world is made by those who control their own destiny. It isn't made by those who don't do, it's made by those who do do. Which is what made me the man I am, I do do.Liz: Yeah, you do.Jack: Grow up, Lemon. FinanceJack: So what are you gonna do with your money? Put it into a 401(k)?Liz: Yeah, I gotta get one of those.Jack: What?! Where do you invest your money, Lemon?Liz: I've got like twelve grand in checking.Jack: Are you an immigrant? Dealing with StressLiz: Hey, nerds! Who's got two thumbs, speaks limited French, and hasn't cried once today? This moi.Managing Your Personal LifeKenneth: Oh, Miss Lemon. You have several messages. Aw, let's see, that company running the bike tour in South Carolina says no singles. Uh, your credit card called they want to make sure you're the one buying cream soda in bulk.Liz: I sure am.Kenneth: And your landlord called and he says it's not the toilet, it's you.Liz: That's his opinion. Liz: I did Big Sister in college. That little girl taught me how to use tampons.DietingLiz: [Singing while eating cheese] Working on my night cheese. [knock at the door] Uhh, Jack! Do you know what time it is? I was sound asleep.Sexual PoliticsLiz: No, Jack. You were just talking about how you miss office hookups. That is a double standard.Jack: Calm down.Liz: I won't calm down. Women are allowed to get angrier than men about double standards. FeminismLiz: Maybe I'm a little old-fashioned. I'm sorry I'm a real woman and not some over-sexed New York nympho like those sluts on Everybody Loves Raymond.FashionLiz: For instance, Jack taught me not to wear tan slacks with a tan turtleneck. I thought it looked nice, but he, rightly, pointed out that it made me look like a giant condom.PoliticsLiz: If I can't poop in the street, why should my tax dollars pay for someone else to?!121!First, I must preface this two star rating by saying that since Goodreads does not allow zero stars I'm forced to reserve my one star ratings only for very special pieces of shit. Secondly, at no time while reading this did my blood alcohol content drop below twice the legal limit and even that hardly made this book tolerable.  I wasn't expecting much, obviously, but this ""book"" fails to live up to even the exceeding low standards of airport bookstores. I liked Tina Fey before I read this book. I like her far less now. Here's some helpful hints for your next ""book"": If we are reading your book then it's a safe bet we have seen your show and reproducing large chunks from your show in your book is superfluous at best and a cheap ploy to fill pages at worst. If you only have 100 pages of material then write a 100 page book, there is no shame in that, or perhaps you can just up the font size to 20 points because the 16 you used isn't quite large enough to be read from space. And the story of how your dad is such a fucking badass in your eyes because he once walked within ten feet of some black people in a parking lot was just painful, so painful, I'm embarrassed for both of us, you for writing that and me for reading it. (It's also my opinion that liberals who repeatedly uses the term 'African American' are probably closet racists. Actually that's less my opinion then it is a hard fact.)!121!Bossypants, Tina FeyBossypants is an autobiographical comedy book written by the American comedian Tina Fey. Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy. Awesome narrative, funny stories. Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و ششم ماه نوامبر سال2019میلادیعنوان: کارفرمایان؛ نویسنده: تینا فی؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21متینا فی همه را فاش میکند و آنچه را که همه ی ما به آن شک داشتیم را اثبات میکنند: شما کسی نیستید تا اینکه کسی شما را رئیس بنامدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 23/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Not to be mean but this word describes the megabestseller: Meager! The degree of insight here is microscopic at most. Anecdotes--those that matter to us, TV/film buffs of the world--are soooo ridiculously scant! Its akin to ridiculing a very unique life with a distanced neverwarm life story. It's unfair; all of it farcical with no pathos at all. The chuckles themselves fail to achieve the expected Cheshire Cat grin madness usually achieved by the brilliant ""Weekend Update"" host. This was unexpectedly underwhelming to me. Impersonal, cutesy, with a sinful-zero amount of compelling stories of life in the comedic fast lane. This autobio is vv (very vanilla)--which, you know, took me by surprise. Its interesting to note just how much more personal, more giving (into their brilliant minds, their methods and techniques, their own sides of the tabloid tale...etc.) other comedic autobiographies are then Fey's (Pohlers, Dratchs, Silverman's...). They came later, way after Bossypants blew up, & they are for the most part better than this one. Still, Fey is obviously (obviously!) a pioneer*.*& its probably my fault I got almost nothing out of ""Bossy...""!121!Thoroughly enjoyed listening to this!!121!The biography/memoirs of liberal leaning American female comedy professionals although all pretty good, quite funny and enlightening are almost becoming inextinguishable in that they feel like that they ae all targeting the exact same 'woke', gay and 'cool women' audience, and as Tina Fey is one of the woman in this sphere that I find the least funniest (but still funnier than the vast majority of non-female comedy writers/performers) it was a pleasant surprise that this is one of the best of the bunch in the aforementioned sub-genre!The usual birth from current high status story with lots of self deprecation and a look at her personal development in comedy is given a more interesting twist than most of her peers in that she came from a staunch Republican household, she is essentially a writer and not a performer (hence works better in this medium), and she isn't afraid to call herself out. On top of all that I got all the behind the scenes stories on SNL's move to a more diverse writers group, 30 Rock, the SNL Sarah Palin sketches and more interesting of all the balancing of being a boss 'Bossypants' whilst being a wife and mother in a world where everyone has an opinion. There are also great chapters on first periods and breast feeding, I kid you not! 8.5 out of 12.2022 read!121!Three and a half stars. I think Tina Fey is awesome. I think this is a slight but solid book. Her authorial voice sounds exactly like her speaking in my head. It's sometimes funny, sometimes self-deprecating, sometimes empowering. It spends more time than one might expect on some things, and no time on others. I think she tried to skirt a line between memoir and humor essayist that is a difficult one to skirt. I think it's an easier thing to do if you're David Sedaris and nobody has specific stories that they want to hear from you. Readers trust Sedaris to talk about the aspects of his life that he wants to illuminate. Tina Fey writes as if she is obligated to spend time on certain things: her Palin impression, her scar, etc., and then she has less time to touch on other things. Mean Girls is mentioned only in passing in a chapter that had nothing to do with it. A longer and more in depth would have talked about writing her first big movie script, or acting in a movie, or working with Lindsay Lohan. I'd love to have heard more Saturday Night Live stories. Not a tell all, but just a little more depth instead of the glances we get.Fey makes some good points about women in comedy, and about comedy in general, and about women in general, and a whole lot of other stuff. She's smart and funny, and wise enough to disguise some truths behind jokes, the way Jessica Seinfeld hides spinach in brownies. All in all, it's a solid book of anecdotes that could have been a little bit more.!121!There’s a chapter in this book where Tina Fey is describing the hectic week that culminated with her filming scenes of 30 Rock with Oprah Winfrey, then rushing to get to the Saturday Night Live studio for her debut performance as Sarah Palin all while she was still making last minute arrangements for her daughter’s birthday party. In between takes, Tina was watching You Tube clips of Palin to work on the voice while holding her daughter and Oprah was asking with genuine concern if she’d have time to get to SNL and rehearse. As Tina puts it:“By the way, when Oprah Winfrey is suggesting you may have overextended yourself, you need to examine your fucking life.”What makes that line extra funny is that while Fey writes about the long hours and stress of doing her TV show and movies, that she went ahead and wrote a book, too. (I think that while she may have had some help that Tina did the heavy lifting here without ghost writers because it’s such a personal story with her style of humor all over it.) The book is called Bossypants because it’s mainly a tongue-in-cheek account of how she became a success and her feelings about her career. As you’d expect, it’s extremely funny with several laugh out loud lines and stories. My favorite chapter was the description of what it’s really like to be the subject of a professional photo shoot for a magazine and how being pampered by hair and make-up professionals while everyone tells you how great you are makes it a bit disconcerting to go home and cook macaroni for your kid. Fey has a lot of fun pointing out her own contradictions. She’s a working woman who is irritated by the double standard of being asked about a being a successful boss and mother when no one thinks twice about successful fathers, but she still feels guilty at the time she’s spent working instead of with her daughter. She’s mocks her own appearance relentlessly but is willing to put herself on magazine covers in tight dresses. She considers herself a poor actor yet stars in a TV show. She’s often insecure and shy, but refuses to be pushed around by anyone. It’s all of these elements and her willingness to mine them for laughs that make this such a funny memoir.!121!Who said women aren't funny? A lot of people, apparently, most of them men. One of these was Christopher Hitchens, the controversial journalist who published an essay in Vanity Fair titled, quite plainly, 
Why Women Aren't Funny
. To this and to the dozen other polemics written about the perceived humor gap between men and women, Tina Fey, in her new book called Bossypants, says, ""We don't fucking care if you like it."" She adds,Unless one of these men is my boss, which none of them is, it's irrelevant. My hat goes off to them. It is an impressively arrogant move to conclude that just because you don't like something, it is empirically not good. I don't like Chinese food, but I don't write articles trying to prove it doesn't exist.Man, this Tina Fey person sure is funny. And she's a woman. And she's sexy. And she's her own boss. She's the creator of 30 Rock, one of the most acclaimed comedy series on television today. 30 Rock is inspired by Fey's experiences working on another comedy show, Saturday Night Live. In Bossypants, Fey relates how she went from being an awkward but intelligent girl in her hometown in Pennsylvania to writing sketches for the aforementioned comedy institution to portraying an awkward but intelligent woman in 30 Rockefeller Center. Bossypants sustains a deftly calibrated mixture of Fey's signature self-effacing humor and her knack for intelligent storytelling that buoys an otherwise tiresome and self-important account of a celebrity's rise to fame and success. Whether she's recalling the circumstances of her first menstrual discharge (""In the spring of 1981 I achieved menarche while singing Neil Diamond’s 'Song Sung Blue' at a districtwide chorus concert.""), narrating the nearly disastrous outcome of her honeymoon aboard a cruise ship (In a nod to the late David Foster Wallace, her fellow New York Times bestselling author, the section detailing the ""very Poseidon Adventure"" trip with her husband is called My Honeymoon, or A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again Either.), or sharing tips on how to pose for magazine covers (""When you look into the lens, imagine you are looking at a dear friend, but not a friend who would laugh at you for jutting out your chin while arching your back against a fake wall.""), Fey is apt to infuse her writing with adorable wit and a strong sense of understanding. There are some wonderful Filipinos [in the cruise ship] who fold your towels in the shape of a different animal every night. It might be an elephant wearing your sunglasses, or a duck wearing your sunglasses. It's just fun. Don't overthink it.Fey hails from a municipality in Delaware County called Upper Darby, where she grew up with her German father, Greek mother, and fellow part-German, part-Greek older brother. There she had her first brush with reality when in kindergarten a boy classmate rudely tore one of her drawings apart. ""I didn’t have the language to express my feelings then,"" the now 40-year old Tina writes, ""but my thoughts were something like 'Oh, it’s like that, motherfucker? Got it.'"" Fey has since been funneling this incipient plucky attitude into every day of her life.After studying in University of Virginia (and, among other crazy things, climbing Old Rag Mountain to impress a boy), Fey became part of The Second City, the improvisation and sketch comedy troupe in Chicago whose accomplished alumni include her close friends and SNL co-stars Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch. The divide between men, who are funny, and women, who are supposedly less funny (if at all, as Hitchens and company would reiterate), was then made only too clear to Fey. The show-runners, she recalls, were hesitant to produce a show with an unprecedented gender-equal cast for fear that ""the women wouldn't have any ideas,"" but in the end they moved forward with the plan. Fey was one of the three funny women in that cast.My dream for the future is that sketch comedy shows become a gender-blind meritocracy of whoever is really the funniest. You might see four women and two men. You might see five men and a YouTube video of a kitten sneezing. Once we know we're really open to all the options, we can proceed with Whatever's the Funniest… which will probably involve farts.As with many other luminaries from The Second City, Fey went on to work at SNL, progressively as a writer, a head writer (the first female to hold the position), and a cast member. In 2006 she left the show to develop and run her own, the highly praised but, Fey admits, low-rating 30 Rock. Aside from being its creator she is also one of the show's main actors, playing a considerably fictionalized version of herself. On top of that she is an executive producer of the show, carrying the unofficial title of ""boss."" Giving credit where credit is due, Fey is not one to pass up any available space between words in her book to point out that much of 30 Rock's relative success is ascribable to her co-star Alec Baldwin and her cadre of comic writers, one of whom came up with this classic line by the character Tracy Jordan, who is of course played by the actor Tracy Morgan: ""Stop eating people’s old french fries, little pigeon. Have some self-respect. Don’t you know you can fly?""Bossypants suggests that at a young age Fey already knew she could fly. It was just a matter of knowing what she wanted, persevering to get it, and maintaining her purchase on it, even as she's being belittled by chauvinistic men and beaten in the ratings game by Two and a Half Men. Fey's most demanding challenge, though, came in the person of Alice, her daughter, to whom the book's unexpectedly emotional antepenultimate section is dedicated. Its title: The Mother's Prayer for Its Daughter.Fey ends her consistently hilarious, laugh-out-loud (really, it is) memoiristic book pondering the possibility of a second child.Science shows that fertility and movie offers drop off steeply for women after forty.I have one top-notch baby with whom I am in love. It's a head-over-heels ""first love"" kind of thing, because I pay for everything and all we do is hold hands.When she says, ""I wish I had a baby sister,"" I am stricken with guilt and panic. When she says, ""Mommy, I need Aqua Sand,"" or ""I only want to eat gum!"" or ""Wipe my butt!"" I am less affected.Fey is now five months pregnant.—Originally posted on Fully Booked .Me.!121!After 5 and half hours listening to this book i'm not even smiling ! i mean YES there was some funny scenes but mostly just some boring and long stories... Meh :3 i LOVE Tina fey, i loved her movies, she's talented woman i just couldn't enjoy her book as much as I hoped I would. it had some funny scenes, but nothing was ""laugh out loud funny""!121!I've said it before and I'll say it again: Bryan Cranston and Shonda Rhimes have the best celebrity memoirs out there. They're the exception.'Bossypants'- not my cup of tea. Oh, and parts of it were flat out racist. I'm beginning to think two stars is a tad generous. Maybe celebrity memoirs just aren't for me. I don't find them appealing, entertaining or really funny (as some claim to be).!121!Hilarious autobio that touches upon the highs and lows of Tina Fey's life and career. If you're a fan of her humor, as seen on 30 Rock and SNL, you'll be a fan of Bossypants. It's not an in depth, gut-wrenching tell-all memoir. For instance, she only glosses over the incident when she got the facial scar. But if you're familiar with Fey's brand of humor then the lightheartedness of it shouldn't surprise you. She's the sort of average, nice person that has her own strong opinions, but doesn't think that they always have to be heard at the expense of others. She's more apt to poke fun at herself, dissecting her own issues with razor-sharp wit.She's very good about never bludgeoning the reader with microscopic analysis. She highlights key life moments, considering them briefly while avoiding ponderous reflections. Some might say the book stays too surface-level. I say going any deeper would not be the point of Bossypants.Edition Note: I'm reviewing the audiobook and I can't see why anyone would want to enjoy this book any other way. Fey is a great writer, but she's also a really good performer. And here, you get her performing her own material, literally her own life. Her cadence and inflection adds such an important element to Bossypants. If you think you can do better justice to this work with your own reading interpretation, then by all means go for it....Just realize you are wrong. WRONG!!! Stop being a conceited dickhole.!121!The book was funny but like many celebrity/comedian books, I struggled with the lack of any kind of narrative structure or cohesion.!121!My kids recently read and watched Mean Girls and were laughing throughout. It is a busy time for me so apologies for this abbreviated review. I needed light reading to help me get through this busy month and celebrity memoirs fit the bill nicely. Tina Fey is funny. I knew this from Mean Girls, SNL, and other movie appearances that she’s been in. Her humor is front and center in this memoir. I didn’t get this for depth, I got it for laughs, and laugh I did, something I need to help me through this month. I’ve read enough memoirs across the spectrum to know that they are hit or miss. This one was a hit because it was exactly what I needed right now, and secretly everyone could use some more laughter. 3 stars!121!I love Tina Fey. But I loved her more before I read this book. Now I know she's human and capable of disappointing me. This moment was inevitable. But still a little sad.That said, there were portions of this book that killed me. Her ""Origin Story"" was hilarious, especially the talk about her scar and people’s reactions to it. Also, she is a genius when it comes to discussing everyday gender fuckery. I loved her whole take on menstruation and how she thought period blood would be blue because of how it's depicted in commercials. I loved her use of the term “car creepery,"" which refers to guys who sexually harass girls on the sidewalk from the safety of their cars. I love that she yelled “Suck my dick!” to some random car creeper when she was thirteen. Tina Fey, you are my hero. In so many ways. I loved the list of things that can be ""wrong"" with a woman’s body (fupa, cankles, muffin top, crotch biscuits), her ""Remembrances of Being Very Very Skinny,"" and ""Remembrances of Being a Little Bit Fat."" I almost wish she had written an entire book about her feministy thoughts. She nails that stuff, like when she insists on calling blonde hair “yellow” when reading stories to her daughter because why should yellow hair get a special term when brown hair doesn't?Here’s what I didn’t like - too many of her stories were boring or told from a boring angle or felt like they were included for obligatory reasons (at best) or just to take up space (at worst). The Sarah Palin discussion seemed to go on forever and didn't really tell me anything new. Most of the 30 Rock stuff was pretty dull (aside from the MVP jokes). She probably just needed a better editor. With several big chops and some precision cutting, this could have been a masterpiece.!121!4.5 starsI know I am seven years late to this party, but damn was this funny and on point. Ah the things Tina didn't know when she wrote this and yet she still brought up - the #MeToo movement that hadn't arrived yet, Hilary Clinton running for President again, hell there's even a Trump reference in this book! But ignoring all of those yet-to-happen things that she still somehow managed to allude to like some kind of weird comedic prophet, this book was downright funny and relatable. Well, as relatable as someone who is on tv can be anyways. If you haven't listened to this (and YES you should definitely LISTEN to it), you are missing out. So get on this boat, it still hasn't left yet - it very much is still applicable to today, and is still quite fun.!121!So yeah, I was a Tina Fey virgin. Her name meant nothing to me until this book came out. [Insert gasp of incredulity.] People say, ""You know, Saturday Night Live?"" To which I say, ""You know, no telly in my domicile?""No, I don't really live under a rock. I just tune out nonessential information. Anyway, I like Tina because she's funny in the way I would be funny if I were actually capable of being funny on a regular basis. I listened to the audio book, which is really the only way to go with this one, because face it, delivery is everything. Had I attempted the print version, I probably would have dropped it early on. I didn't love it. Parts of it are just so-so. But I did enjoy some parts an awful lot, to the point of hysterical belly laughs. There's a line from a song in A Chorus Line that says, ""Those stage and movie people got there because they're special."" If Tina Fey and her pals are any measure, those stage and movie people got there because they're NUCKING FUTZ! Oh, and also? Tina Fey is the only person I know of who has used the words ""cavernous vagina"" in a sentence. Wish I'd thought of that one first. [Let the foregoing example serve as fair warning to sensitive readers. Fey is not suitable for the easily offended.]And by the way, when I first saw the cover of this book, I thought it was called BossyPARTS. Left me wondering which of Tina's parts were the bossy ones.!121!I figured I would feel exactly about this book as I do about Tina Fey. 90% of the time, I think she's hilarious and smart and I want to be friends with her and I wish I'd thought to say what she said. The other 10% I'd like to tell her (because I'm friends with her) that something she just said was beneath her and I wish she hadn't said it. I was right - that's exactly how this book was. I loved it and I loved her, and I marked something about every other page that I wanted to quote or refer to. Now I have to figure out which I'll use for my review :)You know the expression ""the most serious things are said in jest""? Well, even in her introduction I found what I believe to be a Truth. She's saying who the book is for and what the reader will find in it: ""Perhaps you're a parent and you bought this book to learn how to raise an achievement-oriented, drug-free, adult virgin. You'll find that, too. The essential ingredients, I can tell you up front, are a strong father figure, bad skin, and a child-sized colonial-lady outfit.""She's not so far off. A strong father figure is a big deal.There are several things in this book that make me think Tina and I are soul sisters. Or at least, that we think the exact same things. After describing how her mother handled talking to her about reproduction and menstruation (about the same way as my mom; she didn't), she says about a pamphlet, ""The explanatory text was followed by a lot of drawings of the human reproductive system that my brain refused to memorize. (To this day, all I know is there are between two and four openings down there and that the setup inside looks vaguely like the Texas Longhorns logo.)""Her descriptions of women -- blonde and otherwise -- are brilliant. After an updated list of How Women Should Be (based on Beyonce and JLo), she says, ""The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim Kardashian, who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes. Everyone else is struggling.""As someone who spends a lot of time with gay people (hello, she's in show business), her gay-related stories are sprinkled throughout the book, and ... I like them. One of her best though is close to the beginning of the book: ""I guess I should also state that Karen and Sharon never hit on me in the slightest and it was never weird between any of us. Gay people don't actually try to convert people. That's Jehovah's Witnesses you're thinking of. ... If you could turn gay from being around gay people, wouldn't Kathy Griffin be Rosie O'Donnell by now?"" Seriously, I wish some of my ultra-conservative friends could grasp that part. *sigh*And in her description of her favorite ""summer camp"", she makes a (perhaps unintentionally) poignant statement: ""With his dream of a theater program for young people, Larry Wentzler had inadvertently done an amazing thing for all these squirrels. They had a place where they belonged, and, even if it was because he didn't want to deal with their being different, he didn't treat them any differently. Which I think is a pretty successful implementation of Christianity."" *another sigh*And then I like the fact that her dad is very similar to my dad. I not only like some of her descriptions of ""Don Fey"", but the point she makes about him when others meet him:My dad has visited me at work over the years, and I've noticed that powerful men react to him in a weird way. They ""stand down."" The first time Lorne Michaels met my dad, he said afterward, ""Your father is ... impressive."" They meet Don Fey and it rearranges something in their brain about me. Alec Baldwin took a long look at him and gave him a firm handshake. ""This is your dad, huh?"" What are they realizing? I wonder. That they'd better never mess with me, or Don Fey will yell at them? That I have high expectations for the men in my life because I have a strong father figure? [me: THAT!]Only Colin Quinn was direct about it. ""Your father doesn't fucking play games. You would never come home with a shamrock tattoo in that house.""That's Don Fey.I have tons more things marked -- tons, including this: ""You have to remember that actors are human beings. Which is hard sometimes because they look so much better than human beings.""... but I don't have time to quote anything else because this book is due at the library today and there are holds on it so I can't renew it. You'll just have to read it yourself. Really, you should.!121!2012 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. It’s Tina Fey! It’s going to be funny!! Unless you hate her and in that case she’d reply with: “I don’t give a fuck what you think” (thank you Amy Poehler). It’s a great read for the working mom and “how in the world do you do it”.!121!Listening to Tina Fey perform this book was much more enjoyable than reading it in print. I first read this back in 2011, and I liked it OK, but after hearing a friend rave about how much fun the audio was, I decided to give the CD a chance.It was hilarious! Some mornings I was laughing so hard while driving to work that other drivers would stare at me. Tina Fey performs different voices and really sells the stories. One of my favorite chapters was about her father, Don Fey: ""He's just a badass. He was a code breaker in Korea. He was a fireman in Philadelphia. He's a skilled watercolorist. He's written two mystery novels. He taught himself Greek so well that when he went to buy tickets to the Acropolis once, the docent told him, 'It's free for Greek citizens.'""The story that had me guffawing to the point of being noticed by other motorists was about a weekend when Don Fey decided to rent a rug shampooer, but the machine seemed to be defective: ""'Defective' was a big word in our house. Many things were labeled 'defective' only to miraculously turn functional once the directions had been read more thoroughly. If I had to name the two words I most associate with my dad between 1970 and 1990, they would be 'defective' and 'inexcusable.' Leaving your baseball glove in a neighbor's car? Inexcusable. Not knowing that 'a lot' was two words? Inexcusable. The seltzer machine that we were going to use to make homemade soda? Defective. The misspelled sign at the Beach Boys Fourth of July concert that read 'From Sea to Shinning Sea'? Inexcusable. Richie Ashburn not being in the baseball hall of fame yet? Bullshit. (Don Fey had a large rubber stamp that said 'bullshit,' which was and is awesome).""The stories about her dad were part of Tina's larger narrative about how to raise an ""achievement-oriented, obedient, drug-free, virgin adult."" She lists Calamity, Praise, Local Theater, flat fleet, and Strong Father Figure/Fear Thereof. Tina also had great stories about her youthful adventures in a summer theater program, her experience with the Second City improv group in Chicago, and how she got her start on Saturday Night Live.Tina is good at making fun of herself and her accidental celebrity status. There is an interesting chapter about the 2008 presidential election, when she famously portrayed Sarah Palin on several SNL sketches. Meanwhile, she was busy working on her show 30 Rock, and there was one particularly hectic week that Oprah Winfrey was going to appear on 30 Rock, which was the same day of Tina's first Palin skit.""Saturday, September 13, I got up at 6 a.m. and filmed my scenes with Oprah at Silvercup Studios in Queens. She was great. She really does smell nice. And I got to hug her a lot in the scenes ... Between setups I sat with my daughter on my lap and watched Governor Palin on YouTube and tried to improve my accent. Oprah seemed genuinely concerned for me. 'How much rehearsal time are you going to get?' 'Do you have tapes of her to listen to?' 'You're going there right after this?!' (By the way, when Oprah Winfrey is suggesting you may have overextended yourself, you need to examine your fucking life.)""Another favorite section of the book is when Tina shares her theory that the Rules of Improvisation can change your life. Put simply, the rules are that you should agree with your partner, and then build on it. This is known as YES, AND. ""In real life you're not always going to agree with everything everyone says. But the Rule of Agreement reminds you to 'respect what your partner has created' and to at least start from an open-minded place. Start with a YES and see where that takes you... To me, YES, AND means don't be afraid to contribute. It's your responsibility to contribute. Always make sure you're adding something to the discussion.""Speaking of good discussions, I liked how Tina addressed the issue of women in comedy, and how she has dealt with various forms of sexism and ignorance in her career. She talked about how much things have changed since she first started at Second City and SNL, in that more women are getting roles on comedy shows. One chapter that dragged was about her sitcom 30 Rock. Tina talks about her favorite jokes and episodes, and I think it would be boring for a reader who has never seen the show. The chapter was even boring for me, and I watched several seasons of 30 Rock.But overall, this was a very enjoyable book to listen to. It is rare for me to recommend listening to a book rather than reading it, but in this case, I think the performance is better than the print.First read April 2011Second read May 2014!121!Listen to the audiobook for this one--Tina read its, and she's brilliantly hilarious!!121!Bossypants helped keep me going during my pregnancy! Tina is brilliant and hilarious! I could really relate to her as a woman in an industry dominated by men. She's risen to the top with style and grace. “You let it out honey, put it in the book!""!121!I was expecting more funny. Having read a small portion of this book online (A Mother's Prayer) and having found that very entertaining, I had high hopes for this book. And I should say, it's not a bad read. It's just not that funny. I laughed out loud maybe once, and smiled a few times more. Most of the jokes fell under the category of fairly amusing. Maybe as a script, it'd be great.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers (Paperback),Mary Roach,4.06,217841,2003,"Beloved, best-selling science writer Mary Roach’s classic, now with a new epilogue. For two thousand years, cadavers—some willingly, some unwittingly—have been involved in science’s boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They’ve tested France’s first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender confirmation surgery, cadavers have helped make history in their quiet way. Stiff investigates the strange lives of our bodies postmortem and answers the question: What should we do after we die?","If you can’t cope with the idea of death without a hearty dose of euphemism – this probably isn’t going to be the book for you.When I became an archivist at the City of Melbourne a very dear friend of mine became a technician at the city Morgue. I figured at the time he had watched a couple of episodes too many of Quincy M.E. and that he would find a normal job eventually. It is probably 15 years since I stopped being an archivist – my friend still cuts up dead people for a living. A few weeks after he started work I asked him how it was all going and he replied, “Good, yeah, I can even eat spaghetti now.” Sometimes it is best not to ask.This book is a bit of a career guide for those of us who are post-life. There are a remarkable number of interesting things one can get up to after life. Many of these choices are presented in this book in an up-close-and-personal way that I particularly enjoyed. I’m a fairly robust character, but there were many moments when I made involuntary noises during this book. The swallowed fly was a case in point and by far the worst. The noise I made was loud enough and distressing enough for my daughters to ask what was the matter – they didn’t ask again.Part of my friend’s job involves removing people’s brains – this is also described in some detail here. The problem is that once the brain has been removed you can’t really pop it back from whence it came – so instead it is placed in the chest cavity. This means the head needs to be ‘packed’ and generally this is done with newspaper. One of the decisions made by those putting you back together again is which newspaper would seem most appropriate for you. (I assume in these days of obsessive Orwellian Double-Speak the corpses are called clients or customers or something equally ridiculous – although I wish it was after Waugh and they were called Loved Ones.) I really don’t mind what happens to me once I’m dead – I figure I’m going to be busy enough explaining to God why He doesn’t exist to be worried about what happens to my body – but I must admit that spending eternity with my head stuffed with a Murdoch rag does seem to be a punishment disproportionate to any crime I have committed whilst alive.!121!Fascinating, touching and surprisingly wholesome considering it's about dead bodies
Many people will find this book disrespectful. There is nothing amusing about being dead, they will say. Ah, but there is.
Mary Roach brings cadavers into a whole new, sometimes painfully bright, light. We follow her as she attends autopsies and medical discussions. We learn what happens to bodies as they decompose on the field, under the field and in so, so many places.
The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back.
 We get a bit of a history lesson with the sordid tales associated with body-snatching and the early medicine's need for atomically correct models. We even go so far back as ancient Egypt and their secret honey recipe (you will never look at honey in the same way) (trust me).This is one book you'd have to be
 dying
 to miss out on.
Death. It doesn't have to be boring.

Gotta love her last line. : Mary Roach: By the Book Other Mary Roach books we have enjoyed-----2021 - Fuzz: When Nature Breaks the Law-----2016 - Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War-----2013 - Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal-----2010 - Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void-----2006 - Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife!121!REREAD 2023Omg and Grossness! I made the mistake of trying to eat a bit while reading this! Just no! And then a part where they talk about left over skin being used for wrinkle stuff and something to do with penises. I didn't even look up the word they used. Although, now, if a penis was ever whipped out somewhere, I would have to wonder if that penis had something to do with cadaver skin! I did have to skip over stuff due to my ewww reflex. But there is a lot of stuff I learned that I had no idea about. There is a lot of historical stuff too. And the cadaver drive test dummies! I can't even. So if you're one that is going to donate your organs, just know that no part of your body will go to waste. Well, most of it! Mel 🖤!121!Mary Roach writes about what happens when you donate your body to science. Hilarity ensues. Well, maybe not hilarity but it is a good dose of edutainment.Way back around the time the earth's crust cooled and life spread across the planet, late 1994 or early 1995, I should think, I visited a chiropractic college with the rest of my Advanced Biology class. This trip was memorable to me for three reasons:1) It was the first time I experienced an excruciating caffeine withdrawal headache2) It was the first time I saw a human cadaver3) I smoked five of my classmates playing pool in the student lounge at lunch.Obviously, #2 is the one pertinent to this review, although I am still quite proud of #3. The cadaver I saw had its face covered and its skin looked shriveled, somewhat like beef jerky. My 17 year old mind briefly wondered where the man had come from before my hormone-fueled brain returned my attention to the nubile young ladies in the room. Anyway, let's get down to review business.Mary Roach manages to take a subject that give many people the heebie-jeebies, donating one's remains to science, and makes it humorous at times. She covers such topics as learning surgical techniques via practicing on cadavers, human decomposition, ingesting human remains for medicinal purpose, using corpses in car crash tests, using cadavers for ballistics tests, crucifixion experiments, and even head transplants.While it's not ideal meal-time reading, I didn't find it as stomach churning as some reviewers did. The talk of decomposition and quack remedies of the Middle ages were fascinating and I was really interested in the head and brain transplant experiments. Frankenstein's monster doesn't seem as unrealistic as it did yesterday.Apparently, necrophilia is only illegal in 16 states. Imagine if that was one of your criteria when choosing a place to live. ""Honey, I'd love to live in Florida but then we couldn't have our sexy parties...""Actually, the funeral bits were also pretty enlightening. Did you know they have to suture the anus shut to keep nastiness from leaking out during a funeral? Or that dead people can fart from gas trapped in their intestines? Or that they insert special caps underneath the eyelids to keep them from suddenly opening? Fascinating stuff.Stiff is a very interesting read for those interested in what happens when you donate your body to science, softened somewhat by Roach's sense of humor. Three easy stars.!121!""Many people will find this book disrespectful. There is nothing amusing about being dead, they will say. Ah, but there is.”
Fascinating, funny, gruesome. This is about all the things that can happen to the human cadaver, from body snatching, and crash test dummies, to cosmetic surgery practice and disposal. Mary Roach did a ton of research on what happens to the body after someone has died. It sounds depressing, but she makes it very light and surprisingly funny. I laughed out loud a few times throughout. She also explains exactly what happens to a body in a plane crash and a car crash, the history of acquiring cadavers in the olden days, and different ways to dispose of a body besides cremation or burial. This book was so enthralling and well-researched, I couldn’t put it down. I was never bored because she doesn't use scientific jargon. It's just entertaining and funny and informative and she does it so tastefully.My favourite chapter is called Beyond the Black Box. It explains how scientists can recreate how a plane crash played out based on the remains of those who perished and/or the injuries of the survivors even if they do not have access to the Black Box. Other chapters cover the experiences of medical students in Gross Anatomy labs, live burial, medical cannibalism throughout history, and so much more. The author closes her book with a chapter in which she discusses how her research has shaped her personal preferences for the treatment of her body after death. Ms. Roach's investigative journalism is informative, well-researched, objective, and entertaining (her footnotes are the best).Are you an organ donor or considering donating your body to science? Or even just going with a traditional burial? This book will give you the low down on what actually happens in each of those situations. Trust me, it's not what you think.Highly Recommend!121!In my nonfiction phase during the year, I grabbed this one and after finishing it, regretted its purchase. The book is about medical use of corpses and the human body, present-day and in the past. The subject matter is extremely interesting, and some of the methods, tests, and history behind human body experiments is worth the read. The book makes you want to be an organ donor, or want to donate your body to medical science. The problem is that the author is one of the WORST writers I have ever read to the extent that every time I picked up the book I got angry. I only finished the book because my OCD made me finish it because I’d already started it. The two irritating aspects of the book are: 1) Roach would spend a few pages describing something fascinating and then ruin it all by throwing in the snarkiest comment imaginable. For example, she’d discuss how feet are used by scientists, and then throw in a comment about her stinky socks. 2) A few years ago, a friend saw a movie about the roads to concentration camps at the Tribeca Film Festival that was atrocious because the director stuck himself into the film and made himself part of the story. That’s what this author does for the whole friggin’ book. Just awful.!121!First read of 2017 complete! It was a good one - 4.5 stars.Who knew that a book about what happens to our bodies after we die could be so interesting. This book covers everything to the horrific to the incredibly fascinating. This book may not be for the squeamish, but I think Roach did a great job combining information and humor in a respectful manner to make it more easily accessible to a wider audience.I recently helped to prepare a funeral plan for my Mother. She is still alive, but it was suggested that we prepare ahead of time to make sure that all wishes are met and there is no scrambling when the event happens to figure out what is wanted and where the money comes from - less stressful for all! After reading this book, I am not saying I will go back and change any of our decisions, but it definitely gave me a lot of thinking points I would not have considered and may have had an affect on how my decision making went if I had read this before the planning took place.After death - the inanimate body lives on and something has to be done with it - read this if you want to know more!Side note - This is my second Mary Roach (I also read Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal) and I liked this one a bit better.!121!Mary Roach details a lot of uses for human cadavers in this book, but she missed a major one. As Weekend At Bernies taught us, you can always use the corpse of your boss to scam your way into a free weekend at a beach house. That scientific research is all well and good, but there’s nothing in here at all about the best ways to simulate a life like corpse for your own selfish purposes. I learned more from Andrew McCarthy than I did reading this!Ah, but seriously folks… This is the second book I’ve read by Roach, and I admire the way that she can take touchy and gross subjects like corpses in this one or human feces in Packing for Mars, treat them seriously but still manage to keep a sense of humor about them. While she always has one eye on the science, she never uses it to shield out the normal human responses, and this allows her to provide a clear eyed account of the uses and disposal of the dead. (One of my favorite parts involved Roach asking someone how heads were removed from cadavers for surgical practices and was told that one woman in the lab removed them all. She later met the woman who actually did the chopping and Roach admits that all she could think was, “You cut off heads!!”)So we get treated to a gory set of stories about how science uses corpses in a variety of ways including the study of impacts for the auto industry, how a brain-dead woman’s organs are removed by a transplant team, and a field of bodies left to rot for forensic research. We also get an overview of how science has used or misused bodies to advance both legitimate research and outright quackery in the past. There’s also a long section reflecting on the best way to dispose of human remains since traditional burials and cremations are costly, environmentally harmful and wasteful.While I found this really interesting and enjoyed Roach’s writing and approach, there were times when this book completely disgusted me, and I’ve got a pretty high tolerance for gore. One section about the history of various mad scientists grafting severed heads of dogs and monkeys onto other dogs and monkeys and actually managing to keep them alive for some time was almost too much, and I kind of wished she would have left that chapter out.Still, this was a really interesting book. I just wouldn’t try to eat a plate of lasagna while reading it.!121!Morbid-ish. Plenty interesting. Scary. How would a person wind up somewhere where bodies are studied in their putrefaction ways? Is that even mildly respectful? I'm not built for that, that's for sure. But it's an interesting read, nonetheless.

For two thousand years, cadavers – some willingly, some unwittingly – have been involved in science’s boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. the useful functions that the human body provides to the living world, from medical experiments to various applications in transportation security research, and forensic scientists' research on the classification of different rates of decomposition of corpses. Chapters of the book also deal with cannibalism, methods of extermination (burial, cremation, etc.), and beating heart corpses used in organ transplants. تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و ششم ماه فوریه سال2022میلادیعنوان: جسد: سرگذشت عجیب کالبد بی‌جان آدمیزاد؛ نویسنده: مری روچ؛ مترجم: رضا اسکندری‌آذر؛ ویراستار: سیاوش صفری؛ تهران، نشر نون، سال1400؛ در267ص؛ شابک9786226652469؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21منویسنده ی کتاب «مِری روچ» در کتاب «جسد»، نگاهی به سرگذشت اجساد در سده های متمادی میاندازند، و داستان کالبدمان را پس از آنکه آن را ترک میکنیم، بازگو میکنند؛ «روچ» به کارکردهای مفیدی که جسد انسان به دنیای زندگان ارائه میکند؛ از آزمایشهای پزشکی گرفته تا کاربردهای گوناگون در پژوهشهای مربوط به امنیت «حمل و نقل»، و پژوهشهای دانشمندان پزشکی قانونی، در رابطه با دسته بندی سرعتهای گوناگون تجزیه ی جسدها میپردازند؛ فصلهایی از کتاب همچنین به آدمخواری، روشهای از بین بردن جسد (دفن، سوزاندن، و غیره)، و جسدهایی «با قلب تپنده» که در پیوند عضو مورد استفاده بوده اند، میپردازند؛ خانم «مری روچ» با بینشی شگفت انگیز و جذاب و سبکی بسیار خواندنی، سرگذشت جسد انسان را در درازای تاریخ به تصویر میکشندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 08/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Death doesn’t have to be boring.

Thank you Chris for recommending this author! I had fingers-marinated-in-wine fun reading it. 💀☠🧠🥂!121!I'm a compulsive buyer of Mary Roach's books. Part of the reason is research for my own books, of course, part of it is fascination, thanks to her astute choice of subjects, and part of it is simply enjoyment, derived from her clear prose and tales well told. In this case, I read Stiff just after my father passed away, so I was trying to make sense of his loss while trying to come to terms with the brute reality of death. It helped a great deal, as I anticipated it would, largely down to Roach's sympathetic and informative tone. It was like being taken through a morgue by a thoughtful friend.!121!عنوان کتاب خودش رو کامل توضیح می‌ده که با چی طرفیداگه همچین موضوعی براتون جالبه حتماً بخونیدگرچه یه چیزهایی هم داره که ممکنه پیش خودتون بگین ""اگه اینو نمی‌دونستم شب راحت‌تر می‌خوابیدم""خصوصاً یه فصل داره که در مورد حال بهم‌زن‌ترین و عجیب‌ترین چیزایی که انسان‌ها به عنوان دارو استفاده کردن می‌گهاین فصلش باعث شد اینکه ملت به عنوان دارو گه خر دود می‌کنن برام عادی‌تر بشه!121!Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/
“Cadavers are our superheroes: They brave fire without flinching, withstand falls from tall buildings and head-on car crashes into walls. You can fire a gun at them or run a speedboat over their legs, and it will not faze them. Their heads can be removed with no deleterious effect. They can be in six places at once.”
If you know me, you already know that I have a different sort of relationship with the dead. You know, the kind where you dress them up . . . 

and play offensive hilarious games with them . . .

Obviously once I heard about Stiff it had to go right to the top of my TBR. In all honesty, I was expecting something just a smidge more entertaining than my high school biology book. You know, the kind of book only a morbid weirdo like myself could truly enjoy. To say I was pleasantly surprised is the understatement of the year.Most of us are already familiar with the potential a cadaver has to continue on after his expiration date . . . 

Stiff takes it to a whole new level, covering just about every potential “career” one can have after death . . . 

^^^^ Yes, please.As well as tackling everything from burial to composting as a potential “disposal” method. Not to mention dealing with the more taboo subjects that relate to the dead . . . 

As a bonus, all of the above subject matter was written about with such charm and humor that I found myself LOLing for real at times. Mary Roach is the type of gal I’d like to have a drink with. Not only was she able to write about “stiffs” with a sense of humor, she also shamelessly owned up to her own oddities . . . 
“I ask whether he thinks it’s bad that I like the smell, which I don’t really, or maybe just a little. He replies that it is neither bad nor good, just morbid.”


If reading a “smart people book” (a/k/a non-fiction) is something you’d like to do more of, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers is one I’d highly recommend.!121!I bought this book when I first taught my class that has a foresnic anthropology component. I thought I could pick out a chapter of this book to assign to them, and it would be a nice, informative, lay-person account that would be entertaining, yet informational. However, due to time constraints, I never got around to reading the book. In that time, several people have borrowed and returned this book to me, so my copy is a bit tattered and dog-eared, as if I'd read it many times. I can safely say, having read it once, that I will not be going back to read it again.Stiff is a non-fiction, ""science"" writing book. Roach chronicles the different processes that happen to a human being after it dies. Each chapter tackles a different possible outcome for a person's corpse. She goes through chapters about anatomy labs, decay, crash-test and military trials (for safer vehicles, or more effective bullets), plane crashes, transplants, burial and cremation, and even cannibalism. The material for this book is endlessly fascinating and I feel like it has a lot of potential.That being said, I find Mary Roach's style of writing intensely irritating, which took away from the overall effectiveness of the narrative. Much of her writing is sort of falsely funny, as if she is very intentially trying to inject humor into a situation through the use of ridiculous asides that do nothing to add information or further her point.She also continually resorts to forced bathroom and genetalia jokes in order to articially infuse the book with humor. On many occasaions, she asks the scientists she interviews about what happens specifically to penile tissues. She then describes the patient if annoyed air that some of the scientists take with the assumption that the readers will all be tittering with her on her side. Well, I'm sorry, I'm with the scientists. I find that kind of thing immature and irrtating, like many of the jokes in this book. The last way that she commonly tries to inject humor into her writing is by pretending squeamishness for the sake of her readers. What kills me about this is that there are parts of the book that are legitimateuly funny, where the humor is not forced but just found in the situation. There is a description of her first visit to a very small town in China that strong reminded me of some of my problems getting around in small towns in various African countries. There is also a funny commentary about a woman who volunteers to get multiple pap smears so that future ObGyns can practice (a job that I hope pays very. very. well). Additionally, there is some really interesting information in this book. I knew a lot about the use of bodies to determine what happened in plane crashes and the sort of things that happen in gross anatomy labs. But did you know that males and females have slightly different EEG profiles? And, after a heart transplant, those do not change. Also, did you know that there have been many proven ways to make riding in aircrafts safer, including shoulder harness seat belts, more emergency exits, sprinkler systems and side airbags for impact, but none of these are being implemented because the airlines don't want to have to incur the extra costs? There are plenty of little factoids like these that are quite interesting.The bottom line for me was that there was simply not enough actual science in this science book. I've read plenty of popular science books that have managed to do a much better job walking the line between entertainment for the layperson and providing good information. As far as book that tell stories about cadavers, I would recommend any of the popular science books by William Bass or Douglas Ubelaker over this book as both fascinating and more informative.!121!3,5* - this was a pretty interesting and entertaining read. It felt a bit repetitive at times but it made up for that with being quite humorous.!121!I never guessed I would want to know about what happens to a dead body after it ... dies. But here I am, reading and now reviewing a book on just that. Was it funny? Sometimes. Was it gross? Sometimes! But was it deeply FASCINATING? Yeah, I guess it was. It really wasn't too deep on the science bits, actually, not spending too much time on the actual bugs in your gut partying down on the glut of the you-buffet, but it did have plenty of eyewitness accounts of morgues and the everyday lives of the folks there. Plus the military outfits that used bodies for ballistics research. And let's not forget about the second half of the book that goes into the really funky stuff.You know, like methods of disposal of your earthly remains from a historical standpoint. Oh, you wacky Resurrectionists. Or my personal favorite modern (and hopefully soon-to-be-legal for you, soon) composting farms!Look, seriously, folks, I think it's a wonderful idea. First I get freeze-dried, shattered into hamburger-sized chunks, then I GO ON TO FEED THE PLANTS FOR REAL.Like, for real, for real. Since ashes are pretty much worthless for that and getting buried is a joke when you think about it, getting turned into mulch so that you ACTUALLY return your nutrients back to nature is a BEAUTIFUL gesture.Where can I sign up? I mean, donating my body to science is great and all, but the poetry of getting mulched is TOO MUCH FOR ME. My daughter to my granddaughter: ""Your grandfather helped grow this grove of apple trees.""""I thought he was a writer of Science Fiction who rarely went out of the city?""""Oh, I mean it literally, sweetie. After we mulched him and spread him across the land, he literally helped grow these!""""But not with his own two hands.""""Oh, no, we used those, too.""""You don't understand me!""""I want to grow roses. Pink ones.""""Moooooooom!""!121!A while back I told my husband I really wanted to read this book. I went on and on about how it received great reviews and at the time he seemed extremely interested. Let’s pause right here so I can explain his levels of interest and how to read them:NOT INTERESTED – Changes subject at end of the convo and/or walks away.KIND OF INTERESTED – Nods at end of the convo like he might have listened.INTERESTED – Brief eye contact and a nod or two during the convo.EXTREMELY INTERESTED – Total eye contact and verbally interacts throughout convo.I was obviously wrong about his level of interest because he ended up purchasing a different book by the same author. I guess maybe he was only kind of interested instead of extremely, which means I now have to reevaluate how I read his levels of interest. You would think after a gazillion years together I would have this shit figured out.
…ANYWAY…
I did read the other book he purchased first and I enjoyed it (see other review) which made me super excited to read this one. Reading up on facts is kind of my jam and topics about death have always caught my eye because I have a touch of the morbid curiosity. I figure it is a part of life so why not study up on it like you do with anything else you have to eventually experience. Knowledge is power and all that BS.The author did a fantastic job of presenting the cold rigid facts with her unique sense of humor. My only complaint is with my content expectations versus reality. I thought this book would be more about what happens to our bodies after we die, the process of handling and disposing of said body and what all that entails. This book seemed to focus more on what happens when you donate your body to science. I didn’t reduce the rating for this because as a boyfriend breaking up with you says, “It wasn’t you, it was me”.!121!جنازه‌. در ذهن من این کلمه کنار ترس، غم، دفن، مرگ، سردی و بوی بد قرار می‌گرفت. اما حالا بعد از تمام کردن این کتاب این لیست خیلی طولانی‌تر شده. برای کسانی مثل من که جنازه‌ها و داستان بدن پس از مرگ همیشه براشون جالب بوده، این کتاب دوازده فصل بسیار خواندنی دارهقلم نویسنده شوخ‌طبعی خاصی داره که دقیقاً مناسب چنین موضوعیه. موضوعی که در نهایت هر چقدر هم که بخوای با دید علمی و تاریخی بهش نگاه کنی، تداعی کننده‌ی بزرگترین ترس بشر، یعنی مرگه:برای توضیح کتاب بهترین کار به نظرم شرح مختصری از اینه که هر فصل به طور کلی به چی می‌پردازهفصل یک: استفاده از سر جنازه برای تمرین جراحی پلاستیکفصل دو: تاریخچه تشریح جنازه و جنازه دزدی؛ نگاه تاریخی به مسئله تشریح جنازهفصل سه: فساد جسد، مراحل و دلایلفصل چهار: استفاده از اجساد برای آزمایش‌های امنیت خودروفصل پنج: استفاده از اجساد برای تعیین علت و چگونگی سوانح هواییفصل شش: استفاده از اجساد برای آزمایش‌ تاثیر سلاح‌های جنگیفصل هفت: آزمایش به صلیب کشیدن (آزمایشی برای اثبات یا رد نحوه‌ی به صلیب کشیده شدن مسیح)فصل هشت: جنازه‌هایی با قلب تپنده؛ داستان دفن انسان‌های زنده و جستجوی علمی برای یافتن روحفصل نه: قطع سر و جراحی پیوند سرفصل ده: آدم‌خواری پزشکی؛ خوردن جنازه برای مصارف درمانیفصل یازده: راهکارهای جدید خلاص شدن از دست اجساد(کامپوست شدن!)فصل دوازده: نویسنده دوست داره برای جنازه‌اش چه اتفاقی بیوفته؟به جز اطلاعات خیلی جدیدی که از این کتاب گرفتم که به خاطر خاص بودن موضوع اصولاً آدم اتفاقی بهشون بر نمی‌خوره، باعث شد که در مورد این مرحله‌ی پس از مرگ برای خودم فکر کنم. اینکه چی می‌خوام و چی نمی‌خوام؟فکر می‌کنم همون‌طور که نویسنده میگه به جز در مورد اهدای عضو، اینکه چه اتفاقی برای جسد می‌افته بیشتر برای بازماندگان مهمه تا فردی که دیگه در اون بدن نیست. این مرحله در سوگواری آدم‌ها و اینکه چطور غمشون رو پشت سر می‌گذارن مهمه، پس به نظر میاد برای خیلی از افراد تصمیم اون‌ها شاید به تصمیم خود فرد ارجحیت دارهباید بیشتر در موردش فکر کنمکانال تلگرام ریویوها و دانلود کتاب‌ها و صوتیشون Maede's Books ریویو با چند ماه تأخیر۱۴۰۱/۲/۹!121!I've never been squeamish. From when I was a little girl I wanted to know how things work. And ""things"" were also living organisms. Not that I killed off animals to cut them up, mind you, but I started reading non-fiction books very early on and love books about anatomy as much as suspenseful novels about Jack the Ripper to this day. Therefore, the cover and title of this book instantly appealed to me and I'm pleased to report that the author had a very good way of blending facts with an amicable writing style that was simultaneously precise and slightly humorous (though never in an inappropriate way).Mary Roach takes us on a journey through the history of medicine. We learn about ""cures"" from all over the world (including but not limited to placentas and aborted fetuses for a better skin - and you wouldn't believe all the stuff Westerners did, it wasn't just the Chinese) as well as funeral practices through the ages (since it's been 16 years!!! since she mentioned the alternative to cremation, I will definitely check out if there are any news on that front). We thus learn how humans in general learned about anatomy, how that changed our understanding of life and death and how we are still sometimes influenced by romantic (and illogical) views today.This directly ties into human culture around the world and I liked the author all the more for pointing out that what seems strange to us doesn't have to be for others. I'm not sure I agree about the chapter regarding eating dogs vs eating cows but I get what she was trying to say and I was reminded of the German proverb ""In der Not frisst der Teufel sogar Fliegen"" (""In dire times, the devil even eats flies"") which made the excursion into cannibalism so interesting.Most interestingly, for me, was Tennessee. I knew about the university there and its project to help forensics by having the ""Body Farm"" where several human cadavers are kept in various places in different stages of decomposition and loved that she included it in this book as well. Some might say ""yuck"" or ""ew"" but nobody can deny how important forensics are so this is important work and we should be glad there are some people willing to do it!Equally, though not having known about it before, I was quite intrigued about the Swedish project for human compost. I know the Innuit have the mentality of giving their bodies back to nature (though they are often eaten by polar bears consequently so that's a little different at least), but to actively use dead humans as compost ... The thing is, you can still have a memorial service, but what happens to the body needs to be sustainable when looking at our growing numbers and it should benefit us humans and the planet if at all possible. And if a loved one wants a special place to remember the deceased, why not use a familiar and important spot? You don't show love and grief by spending more money than anybody else on a wooden casket that rots anyway, flowers that will wilt or by buying a grave or even crypt. Moreover, once again, this sort of thing just isn't sustainable (it also doesn't matter if you are an ecofriendly person or not, it's just a fact).Personally, I especially liked the chapter about organ donation or giving your body to science after your death because why not? I myself am an organ donor, but I'll definitely also look into donating my body to science if that is possible here. Anything's better than just uselessly rotting or being burnt to ash which benefits nobody but the funeral industry. And let's face it: you won't care once you're dead because you'll be gone.In fact, there is an ongoing debate in my family about this. I, personally, find most funerals disgusting because they are not about the dead but the living. People showing off clothes and who cries loudest and who bought the most opulent flower arrangement. Later, there is constant arguing over who takes care of the grave and who pays for what. And what for??? If your body can serve to make cars safer or doctors better at their work or your organs can save a life or even several - WHY AREN'T WE ALL DOING THAT?! Because of sensitivities and religion and other stupid notions just like them. Honestly, we should be better by now.The author is right: crash dummies will only get you so far, just like certain animal bodies (and how sick is it that we are impious when it comes to animals but not when we're talking about the animal homo sapiens?). Theoretical knowledge, too, will not sufficiently serve a doctor-in-training. I understand why someone would prefer their body to be used to cure cancer instead of helping plastic surgeons but so many scientific breakthroughs came from a corner we didn't expect and whether we're talking about removing gall stones or correcting the angle of a nose, it is surgery so why not help fellow humans? One other thing: I'm all for treating a body on the table with some respect but people tend to take even that way too far and I was negatively surprised how common that is even amongst doctors and scientists!You can see, it is a very interesting topic to me and so many others (like religion for example) have influenced pathology and continue to do so (for the moment at least) so I'm sure many will have vastly different views on this topic. Not that I care. I hope we will continue to develop new ways and to look into what is possible (hands up who enjoyed the chapter about those experiments with severed heads *grins*) so we can evolve further still and maybe shed stupid superstitions.And yes, I've been meaning to finally get to ""Körperwelten"" (the exhibition of specially prepared REAL human and animal bodies) by Gunther von Hagen. I see nothing morbid or wrong with it but regard it as a unique opportunity to see the inside of different bodies. Bonus to the author for mentioning von Hagen and his work as well.A very well-written book full of facts that were presented in a humane way. The author put a lot of effort into this and I learned some very interesting facts. And like I said in the beginning of this review: while the writing style was respectful, she laced it with just enough slight humour here and there to make reading this book very enjoyable indeed.!121!There was not a single zombie in this whole book!!Mary Roach writes books about some interesting topics. This is the one that most interested me, though on finishing I realized that I also had ""Packing For Mars,"" which I think will likely get read sooner rather than later, now that I've finally got around to reading one of her books and have really enjoyed her style. She brings a bit of levity and a healthy sense of the absurd to topics that most of us can go a full lifetime avoiding even thinking about. I find myself having to be a bit of a messenger-killer though, because, while I get that she was being thorough in reporting on the history of anatomy and scientific discovery and experimentation regarding the body, all of the stuff about the animal experimentation just really bothered me. Like, a lot. I think that I'm already like 92.3% misanthropic, and all the ""Hey, let's take the head off of a monkey and graft it onto a different monkey and see what happens!"" stuff probably raised that to like 95.9%. If I had to guesstimate. I can understand if we're trying to understand and DO something. Experimentation is needed. Practicing some things, like grafting together veins and arteries to reattach limbs or do transplants, is vital, and since people are generally hesitant about being the guinea pigs... real guinea pigs are needed. I can understand that. But some of these experiments are just... frivolous god-playing, in my opinion. It doesn't serve a purpose in the long run, for people or animals, and is just done because it can be, because there's no compelling reason not to, and they were ""doing science"". Then there are some little quirky writing things that kind of annoyed me, like Roach's tendency to get off-track and ramble on about a side topic for a bit too long before getting back to the interesting topic she interrupted with her anecdote or sidebar story. And so, I drop a star for these things. But only one, because the rest of the book is great. There are some insights in this book that really made me stop and think. For instance, laws against necrophilia in Nevada were more complete and specific than rape laws in the US: “The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.” Until January 1, 2013 that is, when rape was redefined as: “Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” (Per FBI.gov.)Then there's the statistics of just how man lives can be saved by doing crash test experiments on actual human cadavers. Or how squeamish and prudish people can be about dead bodies. I am not a religious or spiritual person. To me, everything in this book related to putting cadavers to use made perfect sense. I've been an organ donor for as long as I've had the ability to check the box when renewing my drivers license. If I die, take anything useful and give it to anyone who needs it. I can't use them anymore, why should I keep them? Sentimentality? I've had discussions with people who say that they'd ""never!"" check that organ donor box on their license because EMTs and doctors ""won't try as hard"" to save organ donors. To which I call bullshit. They aren't going to check your ID for the indicator before deciding whether to give you CPR, and they probably aren't the ones who would determine whether your squishy insides are even viable options for donation. Plus, the purpose of that kind of transplant would be to save a life, right? And your life is right there, waiting to be saved, while a potential organ recipient is a spot on a list and probably not bleeding out in front of them. Check the organ donor box. They'd try to save you if you need it. I promise. If they don't, haunt the shit out of them. Anyway, as I was saying. In my mind, it makes no sense at all for a perfectly good body to just rot in a hole somewhere, or be incinerated. It can do something worthwhile. Maybe try out the newest seatbelt or airbag technology, or safety harness gear for people who work on insanely high platforms, like the guys who have to fix antennas on building or something. Or maybe they could be used for teaching the next crop of doctors how to actually perform the procedures they are supposed to do. If they botch it their first time out (or second or third or fourth), wouldn't you want that to be a practice run on a cadaver who isn't going to know or care, rather than on you? The section about the soul was lost on me, because, well, as I said, I'm not much of a spiritual type person. I don't really give that kind of thing much thought. That being said, I think it's pretty silly to claim traits have ""followed"" an organ from the donor to the recipient. The claim that a donor heart made the recipient into a sex fiend or made the recipient feel like a teenager and want to drive fast cars and listen to loud music is pretty outlandish. My theory is that the recipient has just been given a healthy heart (or whatever) and suddenly has a new lease on life, and wants to make the most of it. The simplest explanation is usually the right one. Another thing that I thought was kind of silly was Dr. Oz being quoted several times in this book. As an expert, not a TV celebrity quack. I'm sorry, I live in 2015. I just can't take this guy seriously. He's a joke who got rich on daytime TV by exploiting people and selling them bullshit and lies. If he was an actual legit doctor at some point, he's lost any credibility he might have had. I was actually really surprised to see his name in this book. It seemed so rational otherwise. But this, really?: ""[L]ife and death is not a binary system. [...] In between life and death is a state of near-death, or pseudo-life. And most people don't want what's in between."" Uhhhh, right, Dr. Oz. If you say so. You're the ""expert"".The section about ingesting human flesh or secretions for health benefits was pretty yucky, but otherwise I didn't think that this book was distasteful or gross at all. I really thought that the anatomy and decomposition research sections were fascinating, as well as the black box death investigator guy. I also learned quite a lot about the funereal business, which probably shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did... but I guess it's just not something that I've had cause to think about (and hopefully won't yet for a while). I actually appreciated the journalistic detachment mixed with first-hand experience that Roach brought to this. It definitely gave it a lot of credibility in my mind. I think she asked good questions, better questions, if maybe a bit different, than I would have asked. All in all, I think that this was interesting and informative, and it's made me want to explore my post-life options a little bit more. There's a lot of them available now, but there still seems to be a stigma about remains being dealt with in non-traditional ways... or maybe that's just because of where I am, with the prevailing Catholic notions in the area. I'd be perfectly happy being composted via an organic burial pod so I'd be tree-food.!121!Well, I am half way through this and it has turned into a huge disappointment. What started out to be a funny depiction on what happens to donated cadavers, has taken a turn for the horrible. By the 6th or 7th chapter, the author showed what I can only equate to laziness and added commentary on subjects not pertaining to her once appreciated topic. I now find myself skipping over entire pages due to the lack of interest her writing presents and the tangents on which she goes; this I image done for two reasons 1) She needed filler and 2) She thought that by adding humor to the book that it would deflect some of the gore...not so. It gets 2 stars b/c it started off well, but sadly enough, I may not even finish this one.***** UPDATE *****Okay, so I can't really say I finished reading this book, because I didn't. All I can say to sum it up is it sucked. I am that person who cannot put a book down once I have committed myself to a least half of it because I have a hard time leaving things undone, sort of speak. But this book was impossible for me to finish and I cannot understand why it became a best seller. Anyway, save your money and pass this one up.!121!Mary Roach didn't strike me as funny or witty, just annoying. She's like the wise ass class clown in the back row, heckling the teacher and distracting everyone from an otherwise fairly decent lecture. Only she's supposed to be the teacher, too. What was her point? To talk about dead bodies or impress herself with her own juvenile jokes? On a professional note, Roach seems awfully distrustful of librarians. Does she really think the circ clerk at a medical library thinks she's freaky for checking out books on dead people? Does she really think he even cares? Does she really think a librarian is going to mistake her PubMed search as porn and bust her? Too bad, because her ""facts"" like ""a dozen websites say..."" and ""when I googled this I found out..."" make me think she has the research prowess of a cadaver. Roach could use a good librarian, who could help her improve her search skills and also help her find the next open mic night to practice her shtick. Skip this book. Stick to Six Feet Under.!121!Loved this one! Mary Roach brings enjoyment to the macabre in this extremely educational book. Everything you wanted (and some things you didn't want to) know about the life of a cadaver. Packed with laugh-out-loud humour and interesting facts on every page, you'll be sad as it reaches the end. So check this book out and learn all about the exciting life your own body could have after death!!121!In spite of the macabre topic, Mary Roach must have had a ball doing her footwork for this book. Not happy to glean her information from published sources, Mary travelled extensively to conduct her research, and had doors opened for her that I doubt get opened very often. Let's face it, when your job requires you to work with the dead the average Joe already thinks you're a ghoul, so it follows that you would be very cautious about allowing someone, a reporter no less, to observe you at your work. I think that her fair and open-minded approach probably broke down barriers very quickly,Mary, you see, is not the squeamish type. She is perfectly willing to stroll around a field of rotting corpses or sniff a shovelful of composting human in order to obtain not only information but sensation and experience. Certainly some work was done in the library - she covers a good deal of the history of the uses and abuses of dead people, with corpses being used for everything from uncomplaining patients for the instruction of cosmetic surgeons to dangling about as test subjects for new military munitions - but the majority of Mary's work was done on site at the labs, clinics and mortuaries where dead people tend to congregate. The result is a fair and honest look at the dead, how we have used them in the past and what we may have to do in the future in order to dispose of the millions of people who will be expiring daily.The book has every right to be sombre. It isn't. In fact, Ms Roach approaches the subject with a form of reverent humor that entertains the reader but does not disparage the departed. This is a respectful and thorough treatment of the topic. I hereby declare that this is one of the best books I have read this year, and I further declare that Ms Roach is one writer I would love to hoist a pint with some day...I have no doubt she could relate many a fascinating anecdote that didn't make it into print.!121!I really ought to have read this sooner. I'm not sure what happened and why it took me so long to get this information into my brain.This is a book about what happens to dead bodies. It's an older title and some of the information therein has changed (Spoiler alert: there are now six? body farms in the US, I think. And the Swedish lady has not been as instrumental as hoped in burying the dead via compost, more's the pity because I totally want to compost myself! There is currently, however, a woman in CA who is trying to bring body compost to popularity and I am all on board!) but it's still incredibly fascinating to find out what we, in America, do with the all our dead bodies and what have been done to corpses historically, and how our opinions on death and the remains have changed in a rather short period of time.Covered herein:-What your corpse can expect as a medical donation;-What happens when you're buried versus cremated;-Other options available for getting rid of your remains;-What other people have done with their dead throughout history;-And much, much more!Keep in mind, this was written by a journalist and not by someone in the medical or deathical profession so if you're hoping for in-depth anatomy discussions, you may be disappointed. Also, if you're the type who feels death should only ever be treated with the utmost respect and honor, you may want to steer clear as, at times, she is mildly irreverent, which, of course, I loved. Only once did I think she bordered on downright disrespectful and I don't even remember what it was that made me feel that way so, obviously, not a huge deal if you're not easily offended by joking around a bit in regard to death and dead bodies.!121!Book Blog | BookstagramHonestly, I am not a science-brained kind of person. Or history. Or geography. Or math. Or...Anyway! With that in mind, the author makes scientific topics, experimentation and the history of anatomy and scientific discovery, easy enough for this dumb-dumb to understand. And even find funny! Roach imbues her writing with a flirtatious tone that kicks the textbook-y vibe right out of all the brainy stuff. It walked the line between informative, engaging and darkly delightful. And there are great sections in this book that will make you think and examine your opinions.That said, there’s also a part of this book about souls that I found kind of silly and eye-roll worthy. The fact that souls were even included in a book based on cadaver science is kind of weird. Especially when you start getting into things like the donor organ transferring “traits” of the “soul” it came from into the recipient. “I got a new heart and it made me a sex addict!” No, you had a brush with death and the psychological ramification of that, combined with knowing someone else’s heart is in your body, has just fucked you up. Stop cheating on your wife and get some therapy!Anyway, I’m not typically a super squeamish person, except for that part in Hostel where he slashes the dude's ankles……but the whole part about animal testing just made me want to scream. Head transplants on monkeys just to see what happens? I will burn this place to the ground!!! I have a huge, huge, Huge, HUGE problem with animal testing. Anything that is alive and cannot consent, should be left the fuck alone. This was fun and educational and eye-opening. There’s much to be absorbed from this. It even gave me some options to consider for what happens to me after I die… If I ever do! Muahahahahahahhsdgffg *cough, choking*… (But seriously, become an organ donor.)⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 4 stars!121!in my *morbid nonfiction book* era!121!R, is for Roach
3.5 StarsHUM-ANE: adjective: humane; comparative adjective: humaner; superlative adjective: humanest1. having or showing compassion or benevolence. ""regulations ensuring the humane treatment of animals"" synonyms: compassionate, kind, considerate, understanding, sympathetic, tolerant; How is it that a species with a history ripe with abuse and mistreatment of animals has come to use a word so similar to that species title to describe the very thing history proves us not to be?! ARROGANCE. The above is just food for thought, not something Roach broaches in Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. In this book you will find many different uses for a human body after that body is no longer occupied. And to say it is fascinating is the understatement of the year. While some may call this morbid, I simply found it a scientific, at times humorous, and an extremely interesting read. As a species we have this almost innate fear of death. If you were to do a study of fears you would in fact learn that ‘Death’ is the most common fear that exists. I find this preposterous, death is inevitable. What we really fear isn’t death itself (at least for the most part); it is the act of ‘dying’ and the pain and hardship that comes with living in a body you KNOW is failing you. Death isn’t scary, DYING is scary.  This book also isn’t about that. ( I should really stop talking about things this book ISN’T about) This book is about the serious scientific advancements that have come about owing to the use of the cadaver. And our history is full of horrible instances of grave-robbing, non-consensual cadaver use and even murder when it comes to furthering science or scientific advancements by using the body of a person who can no longer object. Some of these uses, naturally, are horrifying. Some of the stories and snipits from history are deeply unsettling. There are a couple chapters I wouldn’t advise eating before, after or during (I.e. the one on human cannibalism) but for the most part Roach has a witty, interesting non-fiction that manages to be illuminating and funny at the same time. Now I will answer the question that crosses probably every reader's mind, and certainly crossed (and is shared) Roach's mind, what about you:My answer is similar to hers actually, I will - provided they want them - be at very least an organ donor on this I will firmly stand, to the devil with my family or loved ones' squeamishness if I can save lives. I will however leave the final call on donating my body to science pending my survivors wishes. I will be dead, they will be the ones living with that not me.Category: A Non-Fiction Book","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Humor', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Death']"
A Brief History of Time (Paperback),Stephen Hawking,4.21,429368,1988,"A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unending—or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?Told in language we all can understand, A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and “arrows of time,” of the big bang and a bigger God—where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation.","This book puts me in mind of the story about how a Harvard number theorist, through some malfunction of the scheduling computer, got assigned to teach an introductory course in pre-calculus. Being one of those individuals to whom math came so easily that they couldn't grasp how difficult others found it, the professor had no idea what to cover in such a course. So, he went to the chair of the department, who told him: ""You'll want to start with the real number-line and then progress to inequalities; from there, move on to quadratic equations, then trigonometry and the wrapping function, Cartesian and polar coordinate systems, and, if time permits, conic sections.""The professor thanked the chairperson and went off to meet with his first class. Next week, he was back.""What should I teach them now?"" he said.A Brief History of Time is like that -- Professor Hawking doesn't seem to notice when his treatment progresses from the obvious to the arcane, ending with his concept of ""imaginary time"" (very nearly incomprehensible in this overly brief presentation).Fun nonetheless.* * *August 30, 2022 addendum --Time to jump in here, I fear:Having garnered over 650 ""Likes,"" this far-from-serious scribble is by far my most popular review ever — and, truth be told, undeservedly so.For a more thoughtful consideration of a somewhat related book, try my take on Jim Holt's Why Does the World Exist? here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8...!121!It is not clear to me who is in the target audience for this book. At times it tries to explain basic concepts of modern physics in simple language, and at other times it assumes a familiarity with the same subject. For the first time I think I ""understand"" why absolute time is not consistent with relativity theory or that space-time curvature supplants the notion of gravity, and for that I thank the author. There are a few other things I believe I have a glimpse of having (finally) slogged through the book.On the other hand, there are many places where he writes as if it were clear what he is talking about even though it would require a good deal of background knowledge. To give but one example, he starts talking about summing up over possible world histories (I cannot locate the quotation) without explaining what that would mean. Trained in statistics, I have some idea that he is talking about mathematical expectation in the context of quantum mechanics, but I don't know how another reader might make any sense of it (and I certainly don't have more than a vague notion). There are irritating writing practices that could have used some editing, e.g., the use of the naked pronominal adjective ""this"" when in the middle of a dense explanation of an abstruse concept(e.g., ""This had serious implications for the ultimate fate of massive stars.""). My biggest complaints, however, are about his philosophical opinions. Obviously he is entitled to think as he wishes about the ultimate questions, but his assertion that his hypothesis of a finite world without beginning or end would leave no place for God seems beside the point. The classic divide has not changed: some folks look around and say stuff just is, and other folks say there's a power behind the stuff that has at least as much going for it as we do. That argument hasn't changed with his theories. At one point in the book he claims that the late John Paul II told gathered scientists that they mustn't inquire into the Big Bang because that was God's territory. I would wager with anyone reading this comment that such an assertion is just plain false. JPII was a flawed mortal, to be sure, but he was no dope; it certainly sounds to me like someone hearing what he thinks the pope would say. (And the Galileo jokes are pretty dumb -- does anyone think that JPII, who apologized for the embarrassing Galileo fiasco, would go after this guy? It must be all that influence the Vatican has had in Britain over the last 400 years that has him scared.) Other philosophical complaints involve his use of entropy (he defines it first within closed systems and then uses it to explain why the ""thermodynamic arrow of time"" and the ""personal arrow of time"" must run in the same direction -- leaping from a box of molecules to the entire universe!), his droning on about what black holes are like when he doesn't know for sure they exist, his statements about ""random"" and being 95% certain a theory is true (does that mean about 95 out of 100 theories like that are true??). His opinions may be very rich, deep, though-provoking, but how would I (or most general readers) know? You can't really evaluate a judgment unless you know something in the field. And so that is why I ultimately cannot recommend this book: if you know physics inside and out, you might find his opinions interesting. If you don't, you can only walk around parroting what he says about black holes as if you had a clue what you were talking about. What we all really need is a remedial course in physics!!121!‎‏‏=وداعا هوكنج=صرت حرا الآن---------هناك لذّةٌ ما ،، في أن تفتحَ كتاباً تشعُّ من سطوره ألوان الفضاء شيءٌ ما في فعلِ المعرفةِ ،، والتأمل

Bang to Black Holes, Stephen HawkingWhat is it that our eyes do that could possibly affect things? A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a popular-science book on cosmology (the study of the universe) by British physicist Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote the book for nonspecialist readers with no prior knowledge of scientific theories. In A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the non-specialist reader. His main goal is to give an overview of the subject, but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions, Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a Universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه مارس سال 1996میلادیعنوان: تاریخچه زمان: از انفجار بزرگ تا سیاهچالها؛ نوشته: استیون هاوکینگ؛ مترجم: محمدرضا محجوب؛ نشر: تهران، انتشار، چاپ نخست 1369، مشخصات ظاهری 231ص، مصور، نمودار، چاپ سوم: زمستان 1369؛ ‏چاپ پنجم: 1375؛ چاپ ششم: 1378؛ چاپ هفتم: 1380؛ ‌شابک ایکس-964573519؛ موضوع نوشتارهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20ماین کتاب به عنوان پرخوانشگرترین کتاب «کیهان‌ شناسی» شهرت یافته، و به بیش از سی و سه زبان دنیا تا سال1993 میلادی، ترجمه و چاپ شده‌ است «هاوکینگ» در این کتاب با زبانی ساده به بازگویی داستان جهان پرداخته استدر مورد مفاهیم اساسی مانند «فضا» و «زمان»، بلوک‌های اساسی ساختاری، که جهان را تشکیل می‌دهد (مانند کوارک‌ها)، و نیروهای اساسی حاکم بر آن (همانند گرانش) گفتگو می‌کند؛ ایشان در مورد پدیده‌ های کیهان‌شناختی مانند «بیگ بنگ» و «سیاه ‌چاله‌ها» نیز می‌نویسند؛ «هاوکینگ» این کتاب را برای خوانشگرانی که هیچ دانش پیشین درباره ی گیتی ندارند، برای آنهایی که تنها علاقمند به یادگیری چیزهای تازه در اینباره هستند، نوشتند؛مینویسند: (روزی یک دانشمند مشهور -گویا برتراند راسل- درباره ی نجوم یک سخنرانی عمومی کرد، در آن سخنرانی او شرح داد که چگونه زمین به دور خورشید می‌چرخد، و خورشید نیز به نوبه خود به دور مرکز مجموعه عظیمی از ستاره‌ها به نام کهکشان ما می‌چرخد؛ در پایان سخنرانی، پیرزن نحیفی در انتهای سالن به پا خاست و گفت: «آنچه که به ما گفتی مزخرف است؛ جهان صفحه‌ای صاف است که بر پشت یک لاک‌پشت غول‌پیکر قرار دارد.»؛ دانشمند قبل از پاسخ دادن لبخند متکبرانه‌ای زد و سپس گفت: «خوب آن لاک‌پشت بر روی چه ایستاده است؟»؛ پیرزن گفت: «مرد جوان، تو خیلی زیرکی، ولی لاک‌پشت‌های بیشماری تا آن پایین روی هم قرار دارند!»؛ اکثر مردم تصویری از جهان را به عنوان برج بلندی که از تعداد نامحدودی لاک‌پشت روی هم قرار گرفته و تشکیل شده است مضحک و مسخره می‌پندارند، اما چرا ما فکر می‌کنیم چیز بهتری می‌دانیم؟ ما درباره جهان چه می‌دانیم و چگونه این دانش را کسب کرده‌ایم؟ جهان از کجا پدید آمده است و به کجا می‌رود؟ آیا جهان آغازی دارد و اگر چنین است، قبل از آن چه اتفاقی روی داده است؟ ماهیت زمان چیست؟ آیا روزی به پایان خواهد رسید؟ آیا ما می‌توانیم در زمان به عقب برگردیم؟ پیشرفت‌های اخیر در فیزیک، که تا حدودی فن‌آوریهای جدید شگفت‌انگیز هستند، به این پرسش‌های دیرینه پاسخ‌هایی ارائه می‌دهند؛ ممکن است روزی این پاسخ‌ها به اندازه گردش زمین به دور خورشید برای ما بدیهی به نظر برسند، یا شاید به اندازه برجی از لاک‌پشت‌ها مسخره جلوه کنند. فقط گذشت زمان -هر چه که باشد- می‌تواند حقیقت را روشن کند.)؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 18/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 11/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Isn't it amazing that a person can read a book like A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and come away feeling both smarter and dumber than before he started? What a universe we live in!It's quite short and generally a quick read. Not every page is filled with mind-blowing/numbing theories and brain-busting equations. Some of it is just history, say on Newton and such. However, there were a few pages worth of passages where my wee brain felt like it was getting sucked into a black hole...mainly during the black hole segment.I've forgotten so much since I left school, and since school was such a long time ago, some of what was taught back then is now outdated, it was nice to read this refresher/cleanser. I came away with a better understanding of the Big Bang theory and why it's plausible (Not the tv show. Its existence is not plausible). I'm trying to sort out the time/space quantifiability thing. That's going to require a reread...and probably further study elsewhere.Surprisingly, I also came away with the idea that God and science can coexist. I didn't expect that. I figured someone like Hawking would be like, ""God? Pssh, whatever."" But that's not his take at all, or at least that not the impression this book left me with.A Brief History of Time was written with accessibility in mind, knowing full well idiots like me wouldn't buy it, read it or recommend it if it were impossibly dense. Hawking's sense of humor even comes through on occasion, which is always appreciated in these sciencey texty thingies. So, I'll probably move on to his Briefer History... next and I'd be quite willing to read others as well!!121!Well, then.I know most of you think this is a book in which Stephen Hawking explains the history of what we think we know about space and time and the beginnings and end of the universe.You're wrong.This is a book in which Stephen Hawking shows people like me how poor our comprehension skills are.WHAT EVEN IS QUANTUM MECHANICS!?And more importantly, who are these people who understand it!?Granted, I still use my fingers to count, so... You know what surprised me most about this book?As he was talking about Copernicus and Newton and Einstein and all of the theories they've come up with to describe how the universe works and how the earth spins and the stars burn, he never ONCE mentioned the Flat Earth theory as a viable thing. I mean, he kinda sorta flipped through it as a 'thing of the past' because of some 5th-century dude called Pythagoras thought there was something wonky about the moon being round if the earth wasn't round, too. It took a few hundred more years for Aristotle to put his name behind the idea and then apparently everyone just went with it.But seriously.Are we 100% sure the earth isn't flat? Because I saw this YouTube video the other day that made a really good case for it. <--hosted by this guy called QAnon - sounded totally legit He also talked a lot about the universe expanding and how that relates to (maybe) how the universe started. It seems as though common sense would say that if everything is moving away from each other, then if you were to hit rewind on your VCR you might be able to see it all contracting back together. At some point that contraction is just going to get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and... <--then he brought up the quantum mechanics thing and just lost me.Ok, to be fair, he lost me when he started talking about how we MIGHT not be the center of the universe with everything revolving around the Earth.The bottom line is that this is a love story about science and math and all the other things that I don't understand very well. But fuck it, I'm trying! And that has to count for something, right?Recommended for really smart people.Or for people who are dumb as hell but don't mind being reminded of it.!121!بمناسبة الثقب الأسود الذي توقعه آينشتين و تحدث عنه هاوكينج كثيرا في هذا الكتاب و وضع له النظريات و السيناريوهات و القفشات أيضا و بمناسبة الصورة التي نشرت في ابريل 2019 فهذه المراجعة ربما تذكركم بالكتاب الملهم المختصر الغني جدا بالمعلومات و الذي أعتبره بوابة أساسية لمن يهتم بما يحدث في الفضاء البعيدمع انى دارس هندسه فراغية و هندسة وصفية و مساحة جيوديسيه و رياضه بحته و تطبيقية و فيزياء عامه و ثيرمو دايناميك لكن حسيت و انا بقرأ الكتاب ده انى كنت أدبى و انى خريج دبلوم زخرفهده مش عيب فى الكتاب لكن عيب فيا انا لأنى درست علشان أشتغل و اهتميت بس بالمحتوى العلمى اللى هستخدمه فى السوق و كمان ممكن يكون طريقة التدريس أيامنا كانت مشى حالك و كل عيشالمهم الكتاب مع ذلك شيق و ممتع و مفيد جدا وأسلوبه رشيق و ترجمته ممتازه و دمه خفيف و فيه كمية معلومات تنوء بها العصبه أولى القوهبعد ما بنقرأ الحاجات دى أكيد بنتحسر على بلادنا و علمائنا و على نفسنا و بنأمل يجى يوم ينصلح فيه الحال!121!Stephen Hawking writes in a very simple and approachable way. On the surface the book has been written for the common man, for he who has little knowledge of theoretical physics. Hawking uses basic terminology and he tries not to overload his writing with explanations and information dumps, but at times it is very clear that the reader needs a certain level of knowledge to understand what he's talking about. As such, Hawking makes certain assumptions as he shifts from concept to concept which left me a little confused. Things that don't appear related are related and it made me question who the intended readership really was. I do believe this is a book every reader should try because it is an important one, full of discussions and ideas that could really open up your mind. But I would warn you to be prepared, although this seems like light reading, much of it may go over your head. Approach with caution.!121!Things I learnt from Stephen Hawking11 October 2014	Ever since I took up physics in year 11 I have had a love affair with the subject, which is odd since I went on to study an arts/law degree (but that probably had something to do with the fact that I would not have had the staying power to pour all of my energy into helping human knowledge advance towards establishing a unified theory). I still wonder where I ended up getting this book, and it had been sitting on my shelf for quite a while (probably because I was too busy listening to people tell me why I shouldn't read this book), but it wasn't until John Lennox said that it was the most unfinished book (that is people start reading it but do not have the staying power to get to the end) ever written (I'm sure there are other books that beat this book though). There are quite a few things that I have discovered while reading this book, and it is these discoveries that I wish to share with you:1) This is not an anti-God book	One of the impressions that I got from certain people was that this was a book that an atheist wrote to try to argue that God does not exist, in much the same way that Richard Dawkins does in his books. However, that statement could not be further from the truth. In fact, throughout the book the question of the existence of God perpetually hangs in the background. Granted, Hawkings does suggest that if the concept of a infinite bounded universe (don't ask) turns out to be true then it would undermine God's existence, however he does not actually say that this may be the case. In fact his final sentence in this book is that the reason we study physics and try to find a unified theory is because we, as a race, seek to understand the mind of God.2) Stephen Hawkings is actually a really good writer	This probably goes without saying, especially since the cover of my book says that it is a 'record breaking best seller'. While he is involved in some very serious and complicated research he is able to write in a way that many of us who have probably studied physics up to a year twelve level (that is the end of High school) can understand. Okay, I probably have an advantage over most other people since my Dad is a theoretical physicist that we have regular conversations about some of these high level concepts (such as by having any more than three dimensions would cause the orbits of the planets to collapse), but I still found that he was very easy to follow and he explained many of these high level concepts in a way that many of us could understand.3) Scientists have a strange way of viewing the universe	Many of us would be familiar with this guy:but as it turns out, after reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that a lot of theoretical physicists seem to live in the same world that he does. Okay, they probably don't spend their time at the comic book store, or arguing whether Babylon Five is better than Star Trek (actually, one of my primary school friends is a theoretical physicist, and we did have such an argument), but they do seem to see the world in a way that we ordinary people would consider strange.	For instance, we see space as flat, meaning that if we look at a star, as far as we are concerned the star is in that direction. However physicists see space as being curved and that a straight line is not necessarily straight. We would see a brick wall as being a solid object and that the idea of walking through one would result in a sore nose. However physicists see it as being made up of mostly space, and the only reason we can't walk through it is because the nuclear forces (forces that exist inside an atom, not the force that can level an entire city) prevent us for doing so. Then there is the concept of dimensions: to us there are only three dimensions, however some scientists (and Hawking is not one of them) see that there are in fact ten, or even more, dimensions.4) Why are so many scientists atheists	 While reading this book I could not get past about how complex this universe is and it made me wonder why it is, with the mathematical precision of the universe, and the complexity that lies therein, that so many scientists seem to argue that it all came about by chance. Even Hawking argues, using the second law of thermodynamics, that the universe cannot move from a state of disorder to a state of order – a broken plate simply cannot mend itself. However, the argument also goes that with the Big Bang Theory (not the television show) that the universe began in a state of disorder and moved to a state of order, however the laws of physics seem to suggest otherwise because what the big bang did was sent in motion a series of laws that caused the universe to come about to what we have at the moment. However, to go into details would require some intense theoretical physics, something which I have do desire to delve into at the moment.5) Scientists assume the speed of light is a constant	The truth is that it is not. Okay, if light were travelling through a vacuum where there are no external forces acting upon it, then it is a constant, but that is very rarely the case. Take for instance this phenomena:	The reason light behaves thus is because when it hits the prism it SLOWS DOWN, and when it slows down it refracts. Thus my point is proven, the speed of light is only a constant when there are no external forces acting upon it.	So, what external forces may act upon light in space. Well, first of all there are black holes. When light hits a black hole the force of gravity is so strong that it will actually prevent light from escaping. Thus, gravity is a force that effects light and slows it down. Then there is the concept of dark matter, which are clouds of matter that do not emit light and float between the star systems. Okay, we know very little about the stuff (and it is also a theory, so it has not been proven) but my hypothesis is that if this stuff exists then would it not have an effect upon light, namely by slowing it down, which means that there is a possibility that our calculations as to the distance of stars from our own Sun could actually be wrong?6) Scientists do not know as much as we think they know	One of the things that Hawking stresses in this book is that theories are not actually proven. A theory is an idea that has some foundation based on mathematical calculations and empirical evidence. Therein lies the problem. Much of our understanding of the universe is based upon mathematical calculations, and it appears that if an event comes about which causes this mathematical calculation to break down, they immediately set out to try to find another mathematical equation to plug the hole.	Take light for instance. For years we believed that light acted as a wave and suddenly it was discovered that it also behaves like a particle (a particle of light is called a photon). The same goes with matter – for years we believed that they were particles when all of the sudden we discovered that they can also behave like waves. As such, our understanding of the universe suddenly breaks down (meaning that we are not necessarily made up of atoms, but have wavelike properties as well).	Mathematical equations have been very destructive in out modern world. Take the Global Financial Crisis for instance. A bunch of apparently really smart people create complex mathematical equations to determine when to buy and sell shares and how to make billions of dollars. However what these equations did not take into account was the fact that people could not simply continue to accumulate debt without having to pay it back and when people began to default on their loans enmass, the whole concept broke down and we were taken to the brink of financial armageddon.	Another point goes back to Ancient Greece. Here we have the theory of Democritus, namely that matter was not infinitely indivisible (the smallest piece of matter is an atom), and then the theory of Aristotle, that is that matter is infinitely divisible. Scientists preferred Democritus' theory, however they soon discovered that you could break down the atom into protons and neutrons, and you could even break them down to quarks. So, maybe Aristotle was right after all.7) We accept their theories because our gadgets work	It goes without saying that their research and discoveries have lead to the computer that I am writing this on, the energy that powers our devices, and the bombs that can level entire cities. We know how to make a nuclear bomb, as well as a smart phone, so we don't question what they say, because it obviously works. However, as a friend of mine once said, it is still all based on theory, and just because something works does not necessarily mean that the theory is correct. Remember that penicillin was discovered by blind chance.8) Nobel Prizes are simply shiny baubles that have no merit	Okay, maybe the people that win these prizes are actually really smart, but then again, the guys who set up Long-Term Capital Management also won a Nobel prize, which proves my point.9) Nobody really knows how gravity works	Gravity is one of those odd forces that doesn't seem to connect with any of the other forces in our universe. As Hawking points out, there are four forces that have been identified: electro-magnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravity. Out of those four forces (five if you divide electric and magnetic, but since electricity will create a magnetic force, they are effectively combined) only gravity stands out. This is probably why Hawking spends so much time talking about black holes because black holes are where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from its grasp. The other thing is that gravity does not, at least in our knowledge, have an opposing force. Gravity basically sucks, and that is all it does – it doesn't repulse as the other forces can.	It is interesting that in some texts that I have read (maybe it is speculative science-fiction but I simply cannot remember off the top of my head) some people have suggested that gravity is actually a force from another universe that affects our universe and what it is effectively doing is sucking our universe into their universe. However, as I have said, that is incredibly speculative, and since I am not a theoretical physicist I can't really say any more on the subject.10) The God of the Gaps is a cop-out	The idea of the God of the Gaps is that where there are gaps in our knowledge we simply say 'oh, God did that' and think nothing more of it. This goes back to the days of paganism (and Medieval Europe) where all of the unknown forces, such as the weather, was attributed God (or the gods) and we could not know anything beyond that fact. However I am arguing that it is a cop out. Creation scientists who resort to this argument are at best lazy and at worst dangerous. The reason I say that is that it discourages research into areas that we do not understand. Okay, we may never be able to control the weather, or predict earthquakes, but that does not mean that we should throw our hands up in the air and say 'this is too hard'.	While I may be taking a swipe at creation scientists here, I would also take a swipe at the atheists who claim that there is no God. The reason I say that is because there seems to be a fear within the scientific community that suggests that we may not be able to know everything, or that our understanding of the universe may be wrong. The problem that arises is that if we throw the idea of God out of the window and claim that the universe came about by chance, then we deny the fact that we live in an incredibly ordered universe that we can learn and understand through the development of mathematical formulae. If a formulae turns out to be wrong, that does not mean that the universe will collapse in on itself – it won't – it just means that we have to go back to the drawing board and start over from scratch.11) Why are Creation Scientists so dogmatic	Why is it that some members of the scientific community insist that we must take the Bible literally? The Bible is not a scientific text, and it was never meant to be a scientific text. It is a theological text that tells us how we should live with one another and how we should view God. Science exists beyond the Bible, and neither contradicts the other. Okay, granted, God has intervened in this world and done things that break the laws of science, but doesn't he have a right to do that – he created the universe? However, what the Bible tells us is that God is a god of order, and if he is a god of order then does it not make sense that the universe that he created is an ordered universe?	So, maybe you are looking for a whiz bang conclusion to my exposition on this book, but all I can say is that what I have written above pretty much sums up what I have learnt from this book. In a nutshell (hey, this is me in a nutshell), all I can say is that what I have learnt from this book is that the world is an amazingly ordered place in which we live, and having now completed this book I am just as committed to my Christian faith as I ever was. However, if theoretical physics fascinates you, then this is certainly a book that you should give a read (though you have probably done that already).This review also appears on my blog. I have also commented on this book in my review on Interstellar.!121!""والواقع أننا قد أعدنا تحديد مهمة العلم لتصبح اكتشاف القوانين التي تمكننا من التنبؤ بالأحداث في الحدود التي يفرضها مبدأ عدم اليقين""
بدأ ستيفن هوكينج, وهو عالم في الفيزياء النظرية, في كتابة هذا الكتاب في الفترة التي كان مازال يستطيع فيها أن يستخدم صوته وهو شبه مشلول على كرسيه المتحرك, ثم وبعد فترة, وقبل أن يكمل الكتاب, خضع لجراحة شقت فيها حنجرته, ليذهب صوته وهو الشيء الوحيد الذي كان يتواصل به مع العالم آنذاكظن في البداية أنه لن يستطيع إكمال الكتاب, ولكن أحد طلبته ""بريان هويت"" قام بمساعدته, ليس فقط على مراجعة المسودة, وإنما جعله أيضاً يستخدم برنامج لتخليق الأصوات, وهو ما فتح نافذة جديدة له على العالم.وها هو ذا الكتاب بين يداي, وبين يدي الملايين.أول كتبه الموجه للعامة, يشرح لنا فيه حصيلة أوراقه البحثية,كتاب صغير الحجم الثلث الأول من الكتاب تقريباً هو مقدمة تمهيدية عن الفيزياء التي سيشرح لنا قصته معها تالياً في الكتاب, وعن المحاولات والنتائج التاريخية التي سبقت أبحاثه.ثم الثلثين الآخرين عن أوراقه البحثية, التي ارتكزت على الثقوب السوداء, والتي تعتبر نقطة تفرد خاصة حيث تكون الكثافة وانحناء الزمكان عندها لانهائيين, وتنهار عندها قوانين النسبية العامةوقد قام هوكنج بمحاولة تفسيرها باستخدام مبادئ الكم تحت اسم: ""الجاذبية الكمية"", وهي إحدى محاولاته لصنع حلقة وصل بين قوى ثقالة الجاذبية وبين القوى الثلاث الأخرى التي تم توحيدها معاً في نظرية واحدة سابقاًثم ينهي بالمحاولات التي تلته لتوحيد القوى الأربعة, في نظرية واحدة, نظرية لكل شيء, تحديدا نظرية الأوتار, والأوتار الفائقةإذن أين هو التاريخ الموجز للزمان؟ لقد أنبأتنا نظرية النسبية العامة بأنه إذا تحرك أحدهم بسرعة فسوف يمر الزمن عنده أبطأ. كما أنبأتنا بأن الجاذبية, تسبب تشويهاً في نسيج المكان لتجذب إليها الأشياء, وأيضاً تسبب تشويه الزمان, وبقربنا من مصدر قوي للجاذبية كأحد أطوار النجم كبير الحجم ""الثقب الأسود"", يسير الزمن عندنا أبطء من الزمن عند المراقب البعيد عند مصدر الجاذبية, وقد رأى معظمكم تطبيق هذه الفكرة في فيلم انترستلر.وهكذا فالكتاب يتعرض في بعض مواضعه للجاذبية, والجاذبية تؤثر على الزمن. الزمن الذي لن يتطرق إليه الكاتب كثيراً في كتابه إذا ما استثنيا المقدمة التي حشر فيها الحديث عن الزمن حشراً لتتواف�� مع هذا العنوان التجاري, والذي وُفّق في اختياره كعنوان جذّاب.في المقدمة يعلل المؤلف كتابة هذا الكتاب, بأنه ورغم وجود عدد من الكتب الجيدة ""على أني شعرت بأن أي منها لم يكن يخاطب حقاً الأسئلة التي أدت إلى القيام بالبحث في علم الكونيات ونظرية الكم: من أين أتى الكون, كيف ولماذا بدأ؟ هل سيصل إلى نهاية ؟ وإذا كان الأمر كذلك, فكيف ستكون النهاية
وهنا تلاعب بالكلام, ليحوّل كتابه من مجرد كتاب يسرد به مسيرته العلمية في سياق البحث عن النظرية النهائية, إلى كتاب يعالج الأسئلة التي تؤرق الكل. الأسئلة التي لم يعد الفلاسفة قادرين على التعامل معها.وهذه العبارات التي تحتمل التأويل تدعم ما قلته في الفقرة السابقة عن أن العنوان مقصود به أن يكون تجاري بغض النظر عن محتوى الكتاب ومدى خداع القاري به.ونأتي أخيراً للسؤال الأكثر إلحاحاً للمعظم, هل الكتاب للمبتدئين؟ والجواب هو لا, فالكتاب فقط لمتابعي العلوم الذين لديهم الحصيلة الأساسية عن الفيزياء, والكتاب لا يشرح تلك الأساسيات سوى بجمل عارضة, لن تمكنك من استيعاب أي شيءولذلك قام الكاتب بإعداد نسخة أخرى من الكتاب أكثر بساطة بعنوان, ""تاريخ أكثر إيجازاً للزمان"" تجدونها مترجمة أيضاًأما إذا كان لديك الحصيلة الأساسية, فالكتاب ولا شك تجربة مميزة, فالكتاب مليء بالعلم في كل سطر منه, والكتاب يعتبر نصف تاريخي فمعظم ما فيه من نظريات تخطوها الآن, أو أنها لم تكن مكتملة في ذلك الحينكان الشرح سلسل, واستنباط المعلومات وترابطها يشي بمدى تمكن الكاتب وعبقريته في إعادة صياغتها بسلاسة, إلا أنه هنالك استثناء بسيط في بضع صفحات يصف فيها آخر جزء من أبحاثه, وربما يرجع ذلك إلى أن الموضوع نفسه غامض** الكتاب من ترجمة مصطفى إبراهيم فهمي, مترجم قدير للبيولوجي, ولكنه تجاهل قاموس المصطلحات إلى حد كبير, فقام بترجمة التعبيرات بما يراه مناسبا دون أن يرجع إلى المصطلح المتَفَق عليه بالعربية في هذا المجال الغريب عنهفنجده ينوب عن مصطلح ""الأوتار الفائقة"" بألفاظ أخرىويظهر أيضا عدم إلمامه بالفلسفة, فقد ترجم اسم الفيلسوف ""wittgenstein""إلى ""ويتجنشتين"", وهذا خطأ, فهذا الإسم ألماني, وفي الألمانية ينطق حرف ""W"" بنفس نطق حرف الـ""V"" في الإنجليزيةوبهذا يصبح النطق الصحيح لاسم الفيلسوف: ""فيتجنشتين"", وهكذا يترجم في كتب الفلسفة العربية. *****""سيقولون أن الله يستطيع بقدرته بدء الكون بأي طريقة يشاء. ومع هذا فإن الله أيضاً كان يستطيع أن يجعله ينشأ على منوال تعسفي تماماً. ولكنه كما يظهر قد اختار أن يجعله يتطور على نحو جد منتظم حسب قوانين معينة. وهكذا فإنه مما يساوي ذلك عقلاً افتراض أن هناك أيضاً قوانين تحكم الحال المبدئي.""
لقد تطور فهمنا للعالم كثيراً. كنا في البداية نعزو الأحداث الخارجية لقوة فوقية تعبر عنها الطبيعة, وبعدها بدأنا نلاحظ أن الأشياء تتكرر بنظام معين.وقد كانت الثلاثة قرون الأخيرة هي سعي متواصل لاكتشاف المزيد من هذه القوانين, وقد وصلت للذروة بعد أن اكتشف لابلاس في أول القرن التاسع عشر ""الحتمية العلمية"", أي أن كل ما يحدث في العالم من حولنا إنما هو يسير وفق معادلات رياضية تنبئنا بما سيحدث تالياً إذا ما عرفن�� ما يحدث الآن.وقد أدت هذه الثقة المفرطة إلى وجود أكثر من فجر كاذب, نذكر منهم أن:""الفيزيائي ماكس بورن الحائز على جائزة نوبل في الفيزياء, ذكر في عام 1928 لمجموعة من الزائرين لجامعة جوتنجن أن الفيزياء كما نعرفها, ستنتهي بعد ستة شهور, وكانت ثقته مؤسسة على اكتشاف ديراك الحديث للمعادلة التي تتحكم في الإلكترون, وكان من المعتقد أن ثمة معادلة مماثلة ستحكم البروتون, الذي كان الجسيم الآخر الوحيد المعروف وقتها, وأن هذا سيكون ختام الفيزيائيات النظرية""
ولكن كان هنالك المزيد مما لا نعرفه, بل وهنالك أيضاً المزيد مما لن نعرفه أبداً وفقاً لمبدأ ""عدم اليقين"" الذي اكتشفه هاينزبرج""والواقع أننا قد أعدنا تحديد مهمة العلم لتصبح اكتشاف القوانين التي تمكننا من التنبؤ بالأحداث في الحدود التي يفرضها مبدأ عدم اليقين""!121!This is an absolutely magical book, both objectively and for me specifically. I first read it when I was about 9 or 10, and ever since I've assumed that I didn't understand a thing, and read it as a childish boast. Fast forward nearly twenty years, degree and PhD in physics in hand, and I decided to give it a proper read. Much to my surprise I found that the book had permeated my brain! I remembered a huge number of the explanations, and the book resonated with the way I've thought about physics my entire academic career - I think I took in a great deal more than I first thought!As a primer to physics (I would say modern physics, but the book is a little out of date) you really couldn't ask for anything better than this. Especially when it comes to cosmology, this is possibly the best popular physics book that I've ever read. It really is a classic for a reason. It's such a concise, understandable introduction to the field that I'm determined to get my girlfriend (a linguist with no real interest in physics) to read it. Not just because I think she'll understand it, but because I think she will enjoy it!One peculiarity of the text is Hawking returning to the concept of God (with a capital G) over and over again. In some ways this feels like a transitional text, marking the passing of the public generation for whom the church determined the order of all things, and the coming of the current, secular generation. Unlike other authors (looking at you, Dawkins) Hawking always does so in a way that feels respectful while also forcefully stating his scientific case. It's quite feat of writing, much like the rest of the work.You really should read this, it's fantastic.!121!خیلی وقت بود دنبال یه کتاب بودم که نظریات فیزیک جدید رو توضیح بده. زیاد از اصل عدم قطعیت و کوانتوم و نسبیت و نظریه ی ریسمان ها و سیاهچاله و کرمچاله و انفجار بزرگ و غیره و غیره شنیدیم، ولی شاید از هیچ کدوم تصور درستی نداشته باشیم. این کتاب خیلی از این نظریات رو مفصل توضیح میده.استيون هاوكينگ يك مستند سه قسمتى داره، به نام ""به سوى كيهان، همراه با استيون هاوكينگ"" با صداى بى نظير بنديكت كامبربچ، كه بيشتر مباحث اين كتاب رو، بسيار بسيار ساده تر توضيح ميده. توصيه مى كنم كسانى كه تازه مى خوان مطالعات كيهان شناسى رو شروع كنن، قبل از اين كتاب اون مستند رو ببينن.Into the Universe With Stephen Hawkingنکات منفیمشکل اصلی کتاب، اینه گاهی زبانش خیلی فیزیکی میشه. به نظر میرسه آدم باید اطلاعات زیادی از فیزیک داشته باشه تا حرف کتاب رو بفهمه. من دانش فیزیکم در حد سوم دبیرستان و چیزهایی که جسته گریخته از این ور و اون ور خونده بودم هستش، در نتیجه شاید نصف کتاب رو آن چنان که باید و شاید نفهمیدم. خود استیون هاوکینگ میگه که ناشر بهش گفته بود: ""به ازای هر فرمولی که در کتاب به کار ببری، فروش کتاب نصف میشه"" و درسته که تقریباً هیچ فرمولی در کتاب به کار نرفته، اما همچنان زبان کتاب سنگینه. در مؤخره ی کتاب، نوشته بود این کتاب یکی از ""ناخوانده"" ترین کتاب های تاریخ ادبیاته. یعنی عده ی زیادی خریدن کتاب رو و حتی ادعا میکنن خوندنش، ولی در حقیقت نخوندنش! میشه فهمید چرا.نکات مثبتاما جاهایی که دانش ناقص فیزیکم یاری میکرد یا خود کتاب ساده بود، خیلی خیلی عالی بود کتاب. قصد دارم یه بار دیگه بخونمش به همین زودی ها. تاریخ فیزیک از دوره ی ارسطو تا نیوتون تا آینشتاین و هایزنبرگ، مباحث کیهان شناسی، مثل گسترش جهان یا محاسبه ی فاصله ی کهکشان ها، برخی از مباحث فیزیک جدید، مثل اصل عدم قطعیت و نسبیت، جزء جاهایی بود که کمابیش فهمیدم و خیلی لذت بردم. گاهی هم مطالب علمی رو کلاً رها میکرد و شروع میکرد به تعریف زندگی خودش. مثلاً میگفت این نظریه در فلان تاریخ مطرح شد، در اون زمان من با دختری آشنا شده بودم و میخواستم باهاش ازدواج کنم و شروع میکنه ماجرای خودش رو تعریف کردن.کتاب بعدی از این نویسنده، ""کیهان در پوست گردو"" هستش که قصد دارم به زودی بخرم.!121!Apparently this book tops the world list of ""bought but not read"", which may explain why it's so universally acclaimed as a work of genius. If you know anything much about relativity or cosmology, it comes across as a potboiler, admittedly a well-written one with a great final sentence. I wasn't impressed.But... without it, we would never have had MC Hawking. If you haven't come across him, start with the lyrics to ""E = MC Hawking"". Then buy A Brief History of Rhyme.!121!This popularization book provides us with a portrait of the latest discoveries that have shaken the scientific world over the past hundred years: General relativity, quantum mechanics, the Principle of uncertainty, black holes, quarks, string theory, etc., enough to answer many questions: what will become of our universe? How was it formed? Why is CERN so determined to accelerate particles in a tunnel several kilometers long in Switzerland?I will not claim to have assimilated all the concepts in a single reading. Still, the book gives me a good idea of the stakes and the research. Therefore, I recommend it to any science lover, especially as some of the theories explained will soon celebrate their century of existence and have not yet reached ordinary people.!121!Cam tot ce știu din / despre cosmologie provine din scrierile lui Hawking. Îndeosebi din acest volum care a fost un bestseller absolut. O glumă afirmă că toată lumea bună l-a cumpărat, dar foarte puțini l-au citit. Scurtă istorie a timpului ar fi, așadar, cel mai puțin citit bestseller dintre toate. Nu cred că pe autor l-a afectat prea tare acest amănunt nesemnificativ.Mă aflu în situația bizară că știu multe fără să înțeleg totul. Știu, de pildă, că fizicienii încearcă să ofere „o descriere completă a universului”. Mai știu că o astfel de descriere nu este, deocamdată, cu putință. Mai știu că Hawking a fost obsedat de realizarea unei teorii fizice unificate (mecanica cuantică + teoria relativității generalizate), fără de care sus-numita descriere nu este posibilă. Prima teorie (cea cuantică) susține că „universul e guvernat de întîmplare”, fapt pe care Einstein nu l-a acceptat niciodată. A doua oferă o viziune deterministă.Deși ne-am obișnuit să gîndim în termeni finaliști (omul ar fi scopul creației), știu, de asemenea, că evoluția universului nu este finalistă. Evoluția nu are un scop, o „intenție finală”: apariția unei conștiințe care să constate frumusețea și armonia acestei lumi. Pentru Pico della Mirandola, în schimb, acest lucru era evident: „Te-am așezat, Adame, în mijlocul universului, ca să-mi poți contempla măreția” (De dignitate hominis).Știu că fizicienii au propus, la sfîrșitul anilor 60, un așa-zis Principiu antropic (îl comentează într-un articol și I. P. Culianu), care li s-a părut unora argumentul suprem al unei evoluții „dirijate după un plan” (un argument creaționist), dar mai știu că acest Principiu (comentat cu entuziasm odinioară de Penrose și Hawking) nu dovedește nimic. Formularea lui pare o imensă tautologie: „Vedem universul aşa cum este fiindcă, dacă ar fi diferit, noi nu am exista să-l observăm”. Altfel spus: „Vedem universul aşa cum este întrucît existăm"". Afirmația lui Hawking seamănă cu alta, la fel de misterioasă, tot a lui: „Dezordinea creşte cu timpul, întrucît noi măsurăm timpul în direcţia în care dezordinea creşte”. Nimic mai limpede...În fine, mai știu ce a afirmat Roger Penrose despre singularități și găuri negre (universul nostru provine dintr-o singularitate): „O stea care suferă un colaps datorită propriei gravitaţii este prinsă într-o regiune a cărei suprafaţă se reduce la dimensiunea zero. Şi deoarece suprafaţa regiunii se reduce la zero, aşa trebuie să se întîmple şi cu volumul său. Toată materia din stea va fi comprimată într-o regiune cu volum zero, astfel că densitatea materiei şi curbura spaţiu-timpului devin infinite. Cu alte cuvinte, există o singularitate conţinută într-o regiune a spaţiu-timpului numită gaură neagră”.Cam atît...!121!“The universe doesn't allow perfection.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time I know. I know. I both loved and hated this book. I definitely should never have read this book, cut the pages, opened the box, etc.. Somehow Stephen Hawking has written a book that gently fluffs the tail on Schrödinger's cat (or perhaps Schrödinger's cat is fluffing Dr. Hawking). Look, no doubt the guy is a genius and has a fantastic story (ALS, computer voice, nurses, Black Holes, strippers, movies, etc). My problem is the wussification of a large scientific narrative by one of Big “P” Physics primary scientists. Let someone else write a pop-GUT/Blackhole/Big Bang story. Let another writer do the pop-up Children's book with the scratch-n-sniff singularity, the rotating black hole, the pull-out universe.  I want Dr. Hawking doing smart stuff. Let Bill Bryson write the summary science. But it is too late for me. I already crossed the damn event horizon. I've just become entangled with his book, so my ""observer state"" now corresponds to the damn book and the damn book review being both five stars and 1 stars is no longer a possibility; my reader state is entangled or linked now with my own review so that the ""observation of the book review's state"" and the ""review's state"" correspond with each other. I am finished.Hey, now to go see some movies about blackholes and wormholes and assholes.!121!This is the first book I have ever read about science.This is one of the best selling book of the century.I have found it really infomative and my interest in science seems to build. This book is free from mathematical equations (except E=mc2) which is the best thing about the book. This book is so simple that even a lay person with basic knowledge of science can understand it. Stephen Hawking, the author of the book, is one of the well renowned scientists of the century after Einstein. Some people even called him the successor of Einstein due to his work in the field of science. In this book, Hawking talks about black holes, worm holes, time travel, cosmic background radiation (CBM), uncertainty principle, expansion of universe, space and time (or simply space-time), origin and fate of the universe, forces of nature and the most important The Grand Unification Theory (the theory of everything) which is the biggest unsolved mystery of the present time. A brief intro to author, Stephen HawkingThis book is really amazing and is popular in both science and non-science related people. I enjoy it a lot and I would like to recommend it to all the science and nature loving people. And I hope they will also enjoy it.!121!The main idea to take away from this book is that time has a clear direction. Entropy is the idea that the universe moves from highly ordered states to less ordered states. If you take the lid off a bottle of perfume, and leave it off for a few days the perfume will go from being highly ordered (all in the bottle) to highly disordered (all over the room). Hawking uses this idea to explain why travelling back in time is impossible. It requires very little energy to knock a glass over and smash it - but think of how much energy it would take to make the glass jump back into place - all of the bits perfectly back where they were prior to the glass breaking. It would be impossible - and that impossibility is what gives time its clear direction.Philosophically, I tend to feel that the book makes far too much of the Uncertainty Principle. But that is another story.This isn't the easiest book to read in the world and is probably the most bought science book of all time while also being the one most likely gave up on after a chapter or two - but it is a fascinating read all the same.!121!Manny says this book is in the ""bought but not read"" category for most people. Well, I'm proud to say that I bought and read it, that too in nearly one sitting - back in my geeky days, when I used to get a sexual high just from solving a hard maths puzzle.Unfortunately, I don't remember much of it (time for a re-read!) but I remember taking away the idea that time is a sphere. Being Indian, I loved this - because we are strong champions of cyclical time. Also, if time and space are both curved, it creates the possibility of jumping from one place and time to another; which is just delicious.(I bought a pirated edition of this book for 25 rupees from the roadside at Connaught Place in New Delhi. The vendor asked for 50, I said 25, and the bargaining was just starting when he spied a policeman approaching - so he let me have it for whatever I was offering! ""Time"" was on my side.)!121!Hawking is a brilliant physicist and a true expert in explaining highly complex aspects of our physical universe in terms that can be understood by most lay people.Where Hawking fails, in my opinion, is his hubris. He proceeds in to the realm of metaphysics and religion in several portions of this book. For instance, in his chapter on the ""arrow of time"", he states that, essentially, the universe can only move in one direction of time. It cannot go backwards. He also states that this limits the powers of God himself. Now, Hawking never qualifies those statements by defining ""God"". However, if he is talking about the Biblical God, how can you honestly think you're so intelligent as to place limits on a limitless being? If God is so powerful as to have created the universe and all the physical laws, why wouldn't he be powerful enough to change those laws any time he chooses? It is the same concept as a scientist creating a computer simulation of the universe. The scientist can, at any time during the simulation, alter the underlying framework of the simulation, effectively changing the physical laws that simulated universe operates under.Now, whether you believe in God or not, the mere fact that Hawking has the audacity to think he can assign limits on a limitless being should cause you some concern. Hawking, because of his fame and brilliance, is a man that people listen to when he speaks. That gives him immense power over the minds of his readers. He should be more careful in choosing his words.When Hawking sticks to his strengths, however, the book is second to none. Hawking truly has a gift of explaining the powerful forces that shape our lives in ways anyone can understand.If this book had been edited better, it would have received a few more stars from me, but I can't reward stubborn scientific pride resulting in false assumptions.!121!يسعى هوكينج في هذا الكتاب لوضع خريطة أو مسار كوني، بداية من الكيفية التي بدأ بها الكون، إلى وضع الاحتمالات التي سينتهي إليها، وتوضيح ما بينهما من أمور كونية فلكية. بدأ الكتاب بالحديث عن الانفجار الكبير والمتفردة التي بدأ منها، وفيما بعد سيتناول احتمالات تنفي وجود متفردة أولية تقول بأزلية الكون، لكن المتفق عليه بشكل كبير في حالة وجود المتفردة أو لا أنه ثمة انفجار كبير بدأ منه الكون ثم تمدد، ومن الأشياء التي ستناقش بعد هذا هو الكيفية التي تمدد بها الكون. الانفجار الكبير كما قال هوكينج لا ينفي وجود خالق.  ثم يتحدث عن المكان والزمان، ويتناول فيه نظرية أرسطو الأولية التي دحضها جاليليو ثم نيوتن بقوانينه عن الحركة، ومن ثمَّ تناول بالحديث نظرية النسبية لآينشتين، الخاصة بتعارضها من قانون الجاذبية، والعامة المتسقة مع ذاتها. ويتناول بعدها اكتشاف هابل بأن الكون يتمدد، بل ربما يكون لها نهاية حسب نظرية فريدمان. وكانت هذه البداية للنظر إلى أن كوكبنا قطرة ماء في محيط الكون الفسيح، وتمت البرهنة بشكل كامل من قِبل هوكينج وبنروز على أنه لابد من بداية في الزمان على أساس أن نسبية آينشتين العامة جزئية واحدة من النظرة الكونية. وكان مبدأ الريبة الذي قال به هايزنبرج وكم بلانك يمهدان الطريق لميكانيكا الكم، وبالرغم من أن آينشتين مُنح نوبل لمساهمته في نظرية الكم، لكنه كان معارضًا بشدة لها لوقوعها في فخ العشوائية، فلم يتقبل أن يكون الكون محكومًا بالصدفة، ومقولته: ""إن الله لا يلعب النرد"" توضح أفكاره. لكن هذا لا يمنع أن معظم العلماء تقبلوا ميكانيكا الكم، يقول هوكينج: ""ليس لدينا بعد نظرية متماسكة كاملة توحِّد النسبية العامة وميكانيكا الكم، ولكننا نعرف بالفعل عددًا من الملامح التي ينبغي أن تكون فيها""ويفصِّل الكاتب الحديث عن ميكانيكا الكم، فيتناول الجسيمات الأولية وقوى الطبيعة الأربعة.ثم ينتقل للحديث عن الثقوب السوداء وهي جد شيقة، وفي هذا الجزء يستفيض هوكينج في الشرح والتحليل في كل ما يختص بالثقوب السوداء، وربما هذا لأنه كان مهتمًا بشكل كبير بها واكتشف بعض الأشياء حولها.في أحد الفصول بعنوان: أصل ومصير الكون، وهو فصل مميز للغاية، وإن رأيته منفصل عن الكتاب بإعادته جزء بسيط باختصار مما قاله قبل هذا مع توضيح وتناول بعض الأشياء الجانبية، وفي هذا الفصل مناقشة بشكل أكبر للخالق، وإن توصل في النهاية إلى عدم نفي أو إثبات أي شيء، فكما هو الأمر في الفلسفة الإمر قائم على احتمالات لا يمكننا معرفة أيهما أصح، وعلى هذا أيضًا سينتهي الكتاب. ثم بعد هذا يتناول البعد الزماني والمسار الذي يسير فيه الزمان فيما سيسمى بسهم الزمان المطلق للأمام، ومع حديثه عن الثقوب الدودية يضع احتمالات للسفر عبر الزمن وإن لم يستطع أحد البرهنة على هذا لكنه احتمال كبير، لكن الإشكالية تقع في كيفية السفر، وهل يمكن السفر للماضي أم للمستقبل فقط؟ ويدور هذا الجزء حول هذه النقطة بتحليله الأبعاد المكانية الثلاثة والبعد الزماني الواحد وما يمكن أن يكون من أبعاد أخرى. ويأتي الفصل الأخير من الكتاب عن توحيد الفزياء، وهل يمكن أن نكتشف ما يجعل العلم متمكن من معرفة الأشياء بدقة وثقة متناهية؟ وقال بأن الفلسفة لم تعد تثمر في هذا المجال، بل اضمحلت واضمحل دور العقل في التقدم وفي مجاراة تطور العلم.يقول هوكينج في الختام: ""وعلى كلٍّ، لو اكتشفنا فعلًا نظرية كاملة، فإنه ينبغي بمرور الوقت أن تكون قابلة لأن يفهمها كل فرد بالمعنى الواسع، وليس فقط مجرد علماء معدودين. وعندها فإننا كلنا، فلاسفة وعلماء وأناسًا عاديين، سنتمكن من المساهمة في مناقشة السؤال عن السبب في وجودنا، نحن والكون. لو وجدنا الإجابة عن ذلك، فسيكون في ذلك الانتصار النهائي للعقل البشري، لأننا وقتها سنعرف فكر الخالق.""كتاب عظيم ومبسط بشكل جميل، رحلة ممتعة وشيقة في محاولة لمعرفة الكون وحجمنا فيه، ومحاولة للتوصل للخالق، وإن باءت الأخيرة بالفشل، فقد خرجت أشد حيرة وانقسامًا أكثر مما دخلت، ويظل العلم والفلسفة والدين غير قادرين على إثبات أو نفي شيء عقليًا، كل شيء يخضع للاحتمال في كل الأحوال.!121!Only Hawking could write this book - simple, to the point and extremely resourceful. Cosmology is not an easy subject neither can everyone understand its deep connotations. Hawking made it understandable in the most layman terms possible.Blog | YouTube  | Instagram | Facebook | LinkedIn!121!Theoretical Physics from the master himself. It's a great summary, but you need a little background knowledge to understand all the chapters. It's a summary of astrophysics, theoretical physics, and cosmology, and it's hard grasping it all in 200 some pages. I wish it was a little longer.The definitions at the end of the book are very useful. You will not regret reading the book, but you need some peace and quiet while reading it in order to hopefully understand it.I've read the A Bantam Book Edition published April 1988 / A Brief History of Time by Stephan W. Hawking / 226 pages / 56,997 words.!121!A pesar de estar escrito para un público ""no científico"" no puedo decir que creo que sea un libro accesible al 100%. Es cierto que Hawking cumple su promesa de no incluir ni una fórmula matemática (excepto la conocida fórmula sobre la teoría de la relativdad E=MC²) pero los conceptos en sí pueden ser difíciles de imaginar y comprender. De toda la información que Hawking intenta explicar en este libro, ha habido cosas que notaba que se me escapaban. Quizá con algo más de material gráfico habría resultado más sencillo.Aún así, el concepto general de los temas que trata es impresionante si te apasiona conocer la esencia del universo. Realmente había momentos en los que dejaba de leer para procesar algunos conceptos y no podía menos de maravillarme.!121!Stephen Hawking's book is easy to read, but harder to comprehend. In every chapter came a point where my brain couldn't hold another permutation of a theory, and as the book progressed, I ended up taking the same approach as I do when reading a Norse saga for the first time. With sagas, I just read, even if my brain doesn't seem to retain all the information about who is related to who and what they named their horse. Inevitably, at the end, I have a reasonable basic grasp of the saga, and then I have to read it over again to fit more information into that basic understanding.I don't know if the same will hold true here, but it's a nice hope.!121!Space opera
The Milky Way arch emerging from the Cerro Paranal, Chile, 3 December 2009. Author: Bruno Gilli/ESO
A highly articulate summary of the history of astrophysics and its breakthroughs from its origins to 1996 (updated edition). I wish I had had such an introduction to physics and chemistry when I was in secondary school and high school! The layout of the book allows a layman to follow the development of the discipline and its fields over time, while Stephen Hawking never scorns an evocative image to give a better notion to the reader of what, say, the electromagnetic spectrum, thermodynamics or gravity are all about. I definitely recommand to all of you in awe before the universe and its strange marvels :)

Soundtrack:Lux Aeterna - György Ligeti!121!كتاب سلس ويطرح المادة العلمية بطريقة شيقة.لحظة!إذا كتبت مراجعة من هذا النوع سأبدو ذكيا ورائعا. لكنها ليست الحقيقة، فلست ذكيا ولا رائعا، وإنما قارئ متوسط الاستيعاب، أشعر بحكة في دماغي عندما تتعقد الأمور وتطقطق جمجمتي من الداخل إذ يحاول مخي الصغير أن يتمدد ليستوعب بعض المعلومات، ولكنه لا ينجح دائما.ليس هذا دأبي مع كل الكتب التي تناقش موضوعات علمية، فقد مضيت في كتاب الكون لكارل ساجان من الغلاف إلى الغلاف دون أي عسر. أعرف أن ساجان طرح المواضيع ذاتها ولكن من زاوية فلكية، بعكس هوكينغ الذي لا يحيد عن الفيزياء قيد أُنملة. هناك حديث مطول عن الذرات والجزيئات والفوتونات ومواضيع أخرى لم أكن أبحث عنها بصراحة.ماسبق لا يعني أن الكتاب لم يضف إلى معلوماتي بل على العكس إذن ناقش الكتاب أهم نظريتين لشرح كل ما يجري في الكون: النظرية النسبية وميكانيكا الكم. تحدث هوكينغ أيضا عن الثقوب السوداء والثقوب الدودية والانفجار العظيم (ليس انفجارا بالمعنى الحرفي على فكرة) والتأثير المعكروني الموضح بالصورة أعلاه. هناك أطروحات حول بداية الكون ونهايته وإيراد لأهم النظريات التي اُكتشفت في ذلك الميدان. هذا إلى جانب الجانب التأملي في تاريخ العلم وتطور الفكر لدى الإنسان والتحدي الكبير المتمثل في مواجهة التيار التقليدي الذي يتصدى لأغلب الأفكار الجديدة.كتاب يستحق القراءة، مع الكثير من الصبر لأصحاب الميول الأدبية الذين اعتادوا على النوم أو العبث في آذانهم في حصص الفيزياء. الكتاب يستحق العناء لكنني توقعت شيئا أشد تبسيطا وأكثر إمتاعا.!121!A classic text where the amazing Stephen Hawking explains string theory and quantum mechanics ""for dummies."" Highly readable and even comical, it is a superb read. I need to go back and read this one again myself!!121!Without a doubt a masterpiece!It's just incredible how Hawking explains to us the complex and mindboggling secrets and concepts of physics and our universe, with amazing wit , clarity, and simplicity.The questions that we all used to ask to ourselves and to our parents, about god, about time, life and it's meaning, the sky, stars, about who created our universe and about it's beginning, about our fate......we had that unique quality called curiosity when we were children, but then, as we grew up , we somehow lost that ability to ask and question, we no longer felt the same thirst for knowledge and a deeper understanding of things as we reached adulthood, those questions we abandoned as our busy lives got in our way.. But there are quite a few people, whose curiosity and desire to find out more, to explore the truths of this vast universe, never dies. They are always always on the lookout for answers to questions deemed unanswerable , and then to ask new questions , that one by one, fills the gap between us and the truth and makes our understanding of this universe and it's secrets a bit more clearer and deeper,  Stephen Hawking is one such blessed genius! In this book, Hawking familiarise us with the possible beginning of the universe or space-time , which is called the Big Bang Singularity, the Black Holes with extremely strong gravitational force so that even light can't escape from it, the reasons why we are at this time and space of the universe [ this might be because that the present condition, universe ( if there are other universes), and dimensions are the only configuration which allows the existence of intelligent beings like us who can observe and ask these questions], the long quest for a Grand Unification Theory ( that will explain the whole universe completely ) which still continues, and so many more fascinating and incredible stuff. The writing style is highly enjoyable, Hawking is a great teacher and a wonderful writer, his wit and engaging writing makes me forget that I'm reading a scientific book! Highly recommended to everyone who wants to know a little more about this universe and it's secrets. 5 stars.!121!★★★ /5This was an interesting and informative book, but sadly I just couldn‘t grasp everything that it tried to say.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'History', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Astronomy']"
Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster (Paperback),Jon Krakauer,4.24,502467,1997,"When Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Outside Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.","Life got you down?

The Summit of MOUNT EVEREST
For the bargain price of $65,000,[1] we will take you on the adventure of a lifetime full of scenic views,[2] camaraderie,[3] and athleticism.[4]Worried that you lack the necessary climbing experience? Don’t be discouraged![5] While Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, it is not the most technically challenging climb. And in addition to our expertise and mentorship, we will have the support of the local populace, the Sherpa, to handle the basic logistical arrangements so that you can focus on the prize.[6]Never been above sea level? Don’t sweat it! We will prepare you for the high altitudes with our carefully developed Acclimatization Program.[7]Sensitive to the cold?We have you covered…with the best protective clothing available![8]When the time is right,[9] we’ll organize the final push to the summit where you will enjoy the exhilaration of being the King/Queen of the world.[10]Remember your safety and health are our top priority![11]What are you waiting for? There is limited space! Call us today at 1-800-YOU-DEAD to sign up.[12]-----------------------[1] Does not include airfare to Nepal and subsequent FedEx expenses when we return your personal belongings to your grieving spouse in [insert idyllic American town here].[2] Just avert your eyes from the dead bodies along the trail. They have been there for years. Honestly, after the first one, you won’t notice them anymore. [3] Well, most of the people are great. Some of them suck big time…when it matters most too. They’ll pass you over for dead THREE TIMES before they put some effort into helping you.[4] Just kidding! We’ll provide bottled oxygen at the higher altitudes. [5] Seriously, zero experience is required. We’ll take anyone.[6] That’s an understatement! We would be screwed without these guys. They cook, carry the heaviest loads, and lay out the ropes. Essentially they take care of the most dangerous tasks for a fraction of what we pay our Western guides. Plus they always have a delicious, steaming cup of tea ready when you reach your tent.[7] It really is a good program. But you can never be 100% sure how high altitude will affect individuals. We’ll do our best to help if you develop High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) where your brain starts leaking fluids, but remember at the top of a mountain, there is only so much we can do. And again, that’s not much.[8] But it’s still damn cold up there. And if a storm hits and you cannot find your way back to camp? Oh boy! Get ready for a windchill exceeding 100 below zero. And frostbite. Lots of frostbite. Plus what good is all that gear when people keep losing their mittens and we find the deceased half-stripped?[9] Did you not read the previous footnote? Storms. They can come out of nowhere. [10] For a few minutes at least. Plus we use the verb “enjoy” loosely. You won’t have slept or eaten properly for days. You’ll be physically spent. And with your severely handicapped mental capabilities, you may not even realize where you are. Heck, you may not even be at the top in actuality! Some losers mistakenly thought they’d reached the top and placed all their trinket flags. They were off by a good 500 feet. (Plus they died on the way down. Double losers.)[11] Now that’s just a lie. Our number one priority is getting you to the summit, no matter the risks. Otherwise you’ll run home and whine that we turned you around 200 feet from the top. You won’t think to thank us that you are alive to do said whining. And you’ll hurt business. Plus it’s hard as hell to keep you safe up there and you won’t be one quota of help. And health? Ha! You can hardly hold us accountable for the intestinal parasites you’ll contract in that camp where everyone shits in the open.[12] Having second thoughts? Look, why don’t you read Into Thin Air instead? You can read it at home in your bed, safe and warm. The author, that crazy guy, already climbed Mount Everest for you. He reminds me of travel writer, Bill Bryson with his accessible, factual, and tension-filled writing, minus the humor. Because climbing Mount Everest is not funny. Vicariously, that’s the only way I recommend climbing this one.!121!i havent left my house in 37 days and i think its finally getting to me because, after reading this, i immediately thought, ‘climbing everest sounds like fun.’ its official - ive gone insane.___________________________i feel beyond guilty for finding so much fascination with what was the most horrific moment in krakauers life. i am a terrible human, but i honestly couldnt put this down. there is just something about krakauers writing that makes me think his grocery lists are equally alluring. and knowing how personal this was for him made this book that much more captivating for me. i loved how this is formatted, the way the facts are presented, and how coherent the timeline and his commentary is. just everything about this invites the reader in in such an informative and also highly emotionally way. i truly cant imagine what i would have done or how i would currently feel if i was in his shoes. but i am so grateful that he felt the desire to share and document this story. so tragic and, yet, so fascinating. ↠ 4.5 stars!121!RELEASE THE KRAKAUER!!!!seriously, it is time to just raze everest and be done with it already. i mean, it's big and impressive but it is just taking up all this room and killing people so why do we even need it anymore?? can't we just get over it? really, i think it has reached its peak and is all downhill from here.shameless punning aside.so this started out as an article that KRAKAUER was asked to write for outside magazine about the commercialization of everest. it should embarrass us that something that costs 75,000 dollars to even attempt even has the potential to become ""commercialized."" (for example - i just balked at shelling out $7.17 for the sandwich i am eating. and like everest, it is kind of crappy) how misplaced is our spending? for fifty bucks a toe, i will chop yours right off and you can pretend you climbed everest and had a gay old time. everyone wins! but there are purists who think that there was golden age of everest and everything since then has just been compromised and now everest is a trash heap full of inconvenient dead bodies and empty oxygen bottles and really just anyone can climb everest so it isn't even a challenge anymore...THAT IS THE KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT EVEREST WILL FUCKING KILL YOU FOR HAVING!!!do not climb everest - it is a trap!!when i was making this year's thanksgiving meal, i decided to have a little fun and incorporate things i learned from everest into the prep. because i had soooo many brussels sprouts to prepare, as well as parsnips, carrots, beets, sweet and regular potatoes, turnips, onions, cauliflower, etc. it was a lot of peeling. and i tried to see how many i could peel while holding my breath, and what that did to my motor skills. all i learned is that i really like to breathe and any activity in which i cannot breathe is not for me. by the end, i was weeping, ""KRAKAUER wouldn't give up!! he would chop allllll the brussels sprouts!!!"" but from everything i have read of everest (note: two books) it is THE WORST. all of the reaching of the summit which should be time for celebration is always so anticlimactic. you can't stay up there very long because humans need to breathe and all; there is no fireplace and hot cocoa like at the top of the viennese alps, and then there is the small matter of DESCENDING!! all that bullshit and putting-up-with for ten seconds of ""experience""?? i gave all that up in high school, thank you very much.oh shit - i have class now. i will ""review"" more later...okay, so i went to class. i learned some stuff. and i don't have much more to say about this. it is not as action-packed as peak, and a lot of it reads like KRAKAUER working through his personal demons and dealing with his culpability, but it is still interesting. i still think everest is unnecessary - it is like a hot fourteen year old - who needs that kind of temptation, right? oh, and also, this:seriously. everest: who needs it?come to my blog!!121!Note to self: take climbing Everest off bucket list.!121!Into Thin Air or Injustice (of many kinds) on the Mountain.Until almost the end this book was exactly as I expected it to be with just one exception. It was the story of a journalist climbing Mount Everest both as a journalist and as a mountaineer. Ideal getting paid to do your hobby! It was interesting because Krakauer is a damn good writer and because its fascinating to see the details of how the mountain is climbed. It's also disappointing because few individuals do it by themselves, without a major support, like the guy who bicycled all the way around Europe to Nepal and then climbed the mountain alone (I would have liked to have read his story but it was only alluded to in the book. **I later read his book Ultimate High: My Everest Odyssey). For everyone else its a package tour for the fit and not-necessarily experienced who want to climb Everest and have an awful lot of spare cash. Transport is arranged, tents are set up, luggage is carried, there will be steaming hot tea awaiting the climbers on their return to their tents after an expedition, and if they really can't climb well, they can be short-roped and pulled up. Short-roped is the climber roping themselves with a less-than-one-metre rope to the waist of the would-be-climber and literally hauling them up. Still, even with all this portering and pampering I was surprised that the first climbers of the season (using last year's ropes) fitted ropes up Everest so that the climbers didn't have to set their own. More than that, the really difficult bits got ladders installed! But no matter how many shortcuts and easements they are able to achieve there are two things that can neither be predicted nor controlled. One is altitude sickness which in some forms can kill very quickly, and in others causes mental delusions that led one of the team to his death. And the other is the weather. 15 climbers died the year Krakauer climbed.At the beginning of this review, I mentioned there was one exception to my expectations for this book based on several books I have read by this author. The exception was one extraordinary chapter full of the most vituperative nastiness against a socialite climber. I didn't know why it was there. He didn't get any nicer towards her as the book progressed either, but then he said that when he was writing the book he had a 75 minute phone conversation with her. Either she didn't know what he'd written - I would never bother wasting time on someone who had that little respect for me and intended to tell the world - or he didn't write it until after the phone conversation. My only reaction to the chapter was thinking that the author was such a damn bitch.The last chapter was tremendously interesting. Krakauer had not had much respect for another of the climbers - the guide and tour leader Anatoli Boukreev. He felt that Boukreev was more fulfilling his own ambitions of climbing than in sticking to his job of helping others to climb and looking after their safety. Boukreev wrote his own book saying that Krakauer had not mentioned certain incidents somewhat detrimental to himself and that he had made some observational errors, either through oxygen deprivation or wilfullness, and gave his own version of the climb. This argy-bargy went back and forth in print and on tv, and this chapter is Krakauer defending himself. Sadly Boukreev, a climber par excellence, was buried under an avalanche on Annapurna the following year, in 1997, so we will never get to hear what he thought of Krakauer's defence.The book is worth reading because the Sherpas have always been sidelined in stories of climbing Everest. As if it is somehow more praiseworthy for a White man to climb the mountain and its nothing really for the Sherpas who can just hop up and down like monkeys carrying all the loads while the white man Climbs. This book sets the record straight. The mountain could not be the business it is without the Sherpas. The tour companies and guides have enormous respect for these men and their abilities and form as firm friendships with them as they do with anyone else in their lives. Its a shame that this respect doesn't extend to paying them more than the one-tenth they earn compared to the tour guides but of course its justified in the traditional way - this is local wages, this is a lot of money for the locals, the locals don't need the things the guides from America, Australia etc do... Oh YAWN, I've heard it all before. Why can't people just put their money where their mouth is. You can't pay bills and put your kids through school on respect. Reduced by 1-star to four stars because of this.Rewritten 7 May 2020 due to Covid-19 boredom, finding the book and skimming through it.!121!I recently attended the Banff mountain film festival in Canada. One of the key speakers was Simone Moro, the close friend of Anatoli Boukreev, the climber who was killed in an avalanche several years ago on Annapurna and whom Krakauer pretty much vilifies in this book as not having done enough to save the lives of those caught in the blizzard on Mount Everest in May of 1996. Needless to say, the vibe in the room was chilly whenever the subject of Krakauer's version of events came up; he was accused of slander and some in the room even claimed that he had not done much himself to save the lives of those in danger during the Everest disaster. Nevertheless, as a reader of climbing nonfiction, I stand by Krakauer. I have always found his account of the Everest disaster an intensely moving and thought-provoking one. Like Joe Simpson's books, Into Thin Air reveals its speaker to be a climber with a conscience. Kraukauer loves climbing but is completely honest about the fact that such a dangerous sport so often puts one in the agonizing position of having to make life or death decisions under conditions that make clear thinking nearly impossible-- the cold, the lack of oxygen, the immense strain on the body at that great elevation. One gets the sense while reading that he is trying to make sense of this crazy sport as he writes, that this book is his process of figuring out the answer to the question: with all of the dangers and fatalities that result from climbing Everest, why on earth do people actually sign themselves up for this kind of thing? In the years since I first picked up this book, I have discovered many other great climbing books in the adventure genre, although Krakauer's remains one of my all-time favorites. For more accounts of the Everest disaster, see also Boukreev's The Climb and Beck Weather's Left for Dead. If you enjoy Krakauer's writing, you might also enjoy Nando Parrado's Miracle in the Andes, a true account of the narrow escape of some members of a Uruguayan rugby team that survived by any means necessary-- and I do mean ANY means necessary--two grueling months in the Andes after their plane crashed in the mountains on the way home from a game. In addition, Joe Simpson's Touching the Void is a similarly remarkable story of a climber who survives unlikely odds after breaking his leg on the side of the mountain Siula Grande in Peru. There are also movie versions of both (Titled Alive and Touching the Void, respectively.) In addition, a movie version is due out soon for one of Krakauer's other wilderness adventure books, Into The Wild.!121!“[T]he sort of individual who is programmed to ignore personal distress and keep pushing for the top is frequently programmed to disregard signs of grave and imminent danger as well. This forms the nub of a dilemma that every Everest climber eventually comes up against: in order to succeed you must be exceedingly driven, but if you’re too driven you’re likely to die. Above 26,000 feet, moreover, the line between appropriate zeal and reckless summit fever becomes grievously thin. Thus the slopes of Everest are littered with corpses…”-	Jon Krakauer, Into Thin Air On June 8, 1924, the first great challenger to Mount Everest, George Leigh Mallory – along with partner Andrew Irvine – made a fateful attempt to summit the tallest mountain in the world. Expedition member Noel Odell, who was following in support, watched their progress from the safety of camp. In a “sudden clearing of the atmosphere,” Odell reported, Mallory and Irvine appeared as two “tiny black spot[s],” moving toward a “great rock step.” He saw them only for a moment before the clouds came in, obscuring Mallory’s blind march into legend. Neither Mallory or Irvine returned. In the years since, Everest has not grown more forgiving. If you happen to reach the summit, you are at the approximate cruising altitude of a commercial jet liner. The air is so thin that you are literally dying. That, combined with moody weather changes and the typical challenges of mountaineering, makes for a dangerous, deadly environment. Everest is so unforgiving that the bodies of her would-be conquerors – such as the ill-fortuned “Green Boots” – often remain on her slopes for years, becoming macabre landmarks. Despite this frightful reputation, the toll of May 10-11, 1996 manages to stand out. Five people – including two experienced guides – lost their lives after ignoring their own turnaround times and getting caught in a sudden storm. The cluster of deaths would have made news by itself. It just so happened, however, that one of the surviving climbers was Jon Krakauer, an adventurer and journalist on assignment for Outside magazine. Krakauer eventually wrote an article about his experiences, though it was a far cry from the report on Everest’s commercialization that he had originally intended. Ultimately, he returned to his article and reshaped it into a book, Into Thin Air. In the years since its publication, Into Thin Air has come to be recognized as a classic of outdoor writing, despite the counter-publications written by other participants, disagreeing with every single one of Krakauer’s words. Leaving aside the controversies – which swirl around the disaster like the spindrift off the peak of Everest – Into Thin Air is deserving of its lofty reputation. Unlike a lot of first-person memoirs churned out in the wake of disaster or trauma, Into Thin Air is the product of a man with a gift for writing. Krakauer may have thought of himself as a climber who got into journalism, but he is a natural storyteller, and his prose wonderfully evokes the beauties and terrors of the mountainside. In terms of conjuring place, of putting you there with the climbers – whether that is the squalor of a filthy lodge in Lobuje, the vertiginous seracs of the Icefall, or the top of the world itself – Krakauer succeeds at describing the indescribable. At less than three-hundred pages, Into Thin Air is compact and briskly paced. Krakauer indulges a brief – and fascinating – history of mountaineering on Everest, before recounting his experiences as a member of Rob Hall’s Adventure Consultants expedition. Most of the time, Krakauer stays within his own experiences. He tells you what he saw, what he heard, and his impressions of the other climbers (owing to the fact that he wrote this with the wounds still raw and weeping, he is extremely careful in his presentations). The only time Krakauer leaves the first-person perspective is to piece together what happened to those who died while he was not present (Krakauer was one of the first to summit Everest on May 10, 1996, and made it back to camp before the dying started in earnest). Typically, I am wary of memoirs, since they are usually a vehicle for self-promotion or self-defense. Krakauer struggles a bit with being both journalist and participant, of both reporting the action and being part of it. For the most part, though, he strikes a good balance. He points out instances where bad decisions were made – Hall’s failure to abide by his turnaround time, for instance – but he does not reach a verdict or even issue an indictment. Indeed, Krakauer reserves his harshest words for himself, and a hypoxia-induced mistake he made that contributed to the death of one of the climbers. To the extent that Krakauer provides a theory of the disaster, he attributes it to the crowds, with multiple expeditions trying to reach the summit during the same good-weather window. This led to traffic jams that turned the fixed ropes up the mountain into a Himalayan version of a Costco checkout line during a pandemic. One of the most gripping, anxious scenes in the book is Krakauer’s descent, as he has to wait for a slow-moving group to ascend the Hillary Step while his bottled oxygen runs out. There is a saying that the first guy through the door always gets hit. Because Into Thin Air came out so quickly, and grew so popular, it immediately became a target for those who felt slighted or disrespected in Krakauer’s telling. For instance, the famed mountaineer Anatoli Boukreev felt compelled to pen – with a cowriter – his own account of the catastrophe, after Krakauer tepidly chided Boukreev for attempting to summit without supplemental oxygen while acting as a guide. (Krakauer also thoroughly describes Boukreev’s near-superhuman attempts to save the lives of climbers caught in the storm, so it’s not like he had a vendetta).With the passage of so much time, I have absolutely zero interest in parsing all the different accounts, of trying to keep track of the directions all the fingers are pointing. I don’t believe it serves much of a purpose. This isn’t like a plane crash or a train accident, where reverse-engineering the calamity might save other lives in the future. You can’t make Everest safer because it is Everest. When you get near the top, you are subject to hypoxia, which hits everyone differently, and can strike down even the most veteran climber. It’s tough to blame anyone for an error in judgment when they can’t breathe, when they can’t think, when they are dying. To say this event was a tragedy requires some modification. If this was a tragedy, it was of the high-tax bracket, entirely-avoidable variety. To make a supported climb on Everest requires a chunk of change that is quite a bit higher than the median income in the United States. Dying on Everest – unless you are a Sherpa – is a privilege few can afford.To not only risk your life, but to pay handsomely for the opportunity, is partly an ego trip. Yet it is impossible not to stand a bit in awe of those who make the attempt. As Krakauer points out, the summit becomes an obsession for many, one that cannot simply be explained away as a premeditated lunge for the best cocktail party story ever. There is something mysterious in a person who insists on trudging past the deadline, who – like Mallory in 1924 – refuses to simply turn on their heels and return home, and instead keeps reaching for the apex, as time and breath wind down to nothing. There is a cost to Everest that Krakauer aptly shows cannot be translated into hard currency. There is a knowledge that – as a member of Mallory’s expedition later wrote – “the price of life is death, and that, so long as the payment be promptly made, it matters little to the individual when the payment is made.”!121!4.3!121!This book suddenly became very relevant - no less than TEN climbers have died this week (18-25 May 2019) on Everest. The reason for this horrible turn of events is given as inexperienced guides leading inexperienced climbers combined with the usual weather restrictions leading to these ghastly insane queueing situations :Yes, that's the top of the highest mountain in the world. Anyway, original review follows :*********************************************************TEENAGE HAIR-KISSING BOOK DEFACERSThis is the most defaced book I ever read. It must have been used in a school at one point. Up to page 69 there are two different people highlighting passages in pink and green but then in the margins, suddenly there is this:Katie is Eric’s fave, to bad for him, he is silly, I hope he’s a good kisserAnd then on page 77, which otherwise would be blank:This is the most boring book I have ever read, I swear if anyone read this book by choice they are the biggest idiot in the worldJason is such a dorkJonathan has been a fag latelyI HATE THIS BOOKIt will be funny when you ask Jason if he kisses our/your hair. Ask is he kisses your hair, then if he kisses anyone elses hairAlways SpicyOn page 88, in a different hand, we readEric Conner, Feb 24 2000 he asked me outAnd on page 107:Troy is hot! (but I never said that!) And her friend writes:We should go to the movies, you, me, Troy & Eric coz they’re friends & Troy’s hot, so you could have “fun” Okay, I will spare you the rest. There’s a poignant contrast between this dreamy teen hair-kissing and the terror-stricken narrative that Jon Krakauer patiently lays down here. It’s clear that the teenagers just didn’t connect to the story, and in some ways I can see why. In an attempt to be scrupulously correct, JK almost turns the events which killed eight people on Everest on 10-11 May 1996 into a stolid police report. THE GULF OF COMPREHENSION BETWEEN MOUNTAINEERS AND NORMAL PEOPLEMountaineers voluntarily put themselves in harm’s way, spend loads of money on their own obsessive self-centred dreams and then expect to be congratulated by the rest of us for their feats. Lugging your mortal flesh into very high altitudes is madness.There was no forgetting that we were more than three miles above sea level. Walking left me wheezing for several minutes. If I sat up too quickly, my head reeled and vertigo set in. The deep rasping cough I’d developed worsened by the day. Sleep became elusive. Most nights I’d wake up three or four times gasping for breath, feeling like I was suffocating. Cuts and scrapes refused to heal. My appetite vanished… my arms and legs gradually began to wither to sticklike proportions. This was at 16,200 feet. The summit of Everest is 29,000 feet. The further you go up, the more likely you are to get HAPE (high altitude pulmonary edema), where you froth blood, lapse into a coma and die) or HACE (High altitude cerebral edema), where you become deranged, lapse into a coma and die. Krakauer is also keen to deny that mountaineers are adrenalin junkies. We lubbers may imagine that when they get to the summit they experience some great euphoria. Not at all, he says. Getting up a mountain is grinding your way through great pain in the knowledge that getting back down from the summit is more dangerous than getting up to it. Mountaineering does not sound like a healthy outdoor pursuit to me.THE MOUNTAINEERING CLASS SYSTEM Climbing the big mountains like Everest is very dangerous, but it’s popular. A lot of ridiculous rich white people want to do it. So they join guided expeditions. On an Everest expedition there are three classes of people.The guides – these are the white expert mountaineers who organise everything and guarantee client safetyThe clients – these are the rich white people who have nothing better to do. We know they are rich because it costs an arm and a leg to be a member of an Everest expeditionThe Sherpas – these are the Nepalese guys who do the actual manual labour of lugging all the rich white people’s food and essentials from base camp to camp 2 to camp 3 to camp 4 and back again along with making sure the white people don’t kill themselves in the fifty different ways available to them.Sherpas put in the route, set up the camps, did the cooking, hauled all the loads. This conserved our energy and vastly increased our chances of getting up Everest.  This enforced client passivity earns these guided expeditions great contempt in other more radical mountaineering circles. That’s not really climbing a mountain at all, they say. These rich clients have no mountaineering skills themselves. It’s like herding rich white sheep. And some of the haughty sneerers also say that using oxygen tanks is cheating too. They say that you can only say you’ve climbed Everest if you do it without Sherpas and without oxygen. And guess what, some of these hard core guys have gone right ahead and climbed Everest without Sherpas and without oxygen, and when they got to the top they looked down on everyone else, you can bet your life.THE TURN ROUND TIMEInto Thin Air is sometimes flawed by not explaining important concepts clearly enough for us non-climbers. One crucial concept was the TURN ROUND TIME. This was a big part of why eight people died and it took me a while to work out why. On the day your team is going to reach the summit the guide will announce a turn round time, usually 2 pm. This means that wherever the client is,  they must turn round and begin descending at that time, even if they haven’t reached the summit yet. They might be only 30 minutes away but they must turn round and start descending. How ultimately frustrating! There were several companies guiding clients to the summit on 10 May 1996 and one of them was new and very keen to get all of its clients to the summit. So keen that they allowed some stragglers to continue to the summit up to 4pm that day. According to JK, this contributed to some clients getting swallowed up in the sudden blizzard that hit the summit in the afternoon. No one saw it coming. But there was a whole tangle of wrong decisions that day, including some made by JK himself. It’s a complicated picture, but to complicate it further, at least one other book has been published slagging off the conclusions and accusations made by JK in this book. So, a self-inflicted confused disaster, many of the details of which are disputed. At the end of it all I was more convinced than ever that I will never, ever understand the motivations of many of my fellow human beings!121!This is not a review. I don’t feel like writing a review for this book, but I feel like I should at least say something about it because I did enjoy it. I mean, it did make me utter “Jesus Christ” out loud more than one time, and I don’t often talk to myself while I am reading a book.(I almost want to post a picture of a LOLcat with a caption that says “This buk wuz gud,” but I don’t have one.)So…These are a few things I learned from reading this book:1. If a person decides to climb Everest, they are likely to encounter dead bodies along the route up to the summit.2. Lobuje, which is on the way to Everest Base Camp, is a place that overflows with human excrement. While Krakauer was there in 1996, he wrote ""Huge stinking piles of human feces lay everywhere; it was impossible not to walk in it."" Lovely. Insert “Want to get away from it all?” commercial here.3. Without the assistance of Sherpas, it is unlikely that climbers would be able to reach the summit at all. Besides schlepping tons of your crap, they also know the way, and they place climbing ropes and in some instances, repair ladders, so people will be able to ascend the trickier places. The place would also be a lot dirtier without them because they are partially responsible for removing some of the trash that Everest has accumulated over the years. One camp reported having around a thousand empty canisters of supplemental oxygen (as I said below in a review comment, so I might as well stick it in here, too).4. In 1996, it cost $65,000 to be a client on a guided tour climbing Everest.5. It is very easy to develop high-altitude sicknesses and/or hallucinations as a climber gets closer to the summit. In fact, the ""every man/woman for him/herself"" attitude that people had, whether or not they had to have it in order to survive, was more than a little disturbing. On this particular excursion, two climbers got stuck on the mountain during a storm. They spent the night at 28,000 feet without shelter or supplemental oxygen and were believed to be dead. The guide sent to look for them the next day found them barely breathing after chipping off three inches of ice from their faces. Believing that they were beyond help, he left them there. One of the climbers, my personal hero, woke up from his coma hours later and was lucid enough to get himself back down to one of the camps. Sure, he lost half an arm, his nose, and all of the digits on his other hand to frostbite, but he's still alive.Oh, and sure, the events that happened on Mt. Everest in 1996 were tragic, but I do think the people who climb it know what they are risking.!121!Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/
“Everest has always been a magnet for kooks, publicity seekers, hopeless romantics, and others with a shaky hold on reality.”


Welcome to one of Kelly’s creepy obsessions! (Advance apologies - this might get rambly.) Okay, so I’m totally obsessed with all things Everest and CAN. NOT. WAIT. to see the movie that details the same tragic events which are covered in this book (even though just watching the preview in IMAX 3-D made me have diarrhea). I have spent the past month watching EVERYTHING Everest-related on Netflix and You Tube. (Note: I highly recommend the television series Everest: Beyond the Limit as well as Ultimate Survival: Everest – unfortunately the IMAX Everest documentary which was filmed during this fateful 1996 expedition didn’t end up so great. Kudos to the filmmakers for attempting to produce a final product, but really once you’ve watched 8 of your fellow climbers die your heart probably isn’t in the project so much.) Anyway, back to my bizarre fangirl squeeing. Because I’m ignorant I had no clue that Into Thin Air was an Everest book or that it was THE Everest book detailing the storm of the century . . . 

(Note #2: The film is the same story, but the rights to Krakauer’s book were not purchased in order to make it – it’s a conglomeration of all of the survivors’ memories.) I had read Into the Wild and enjoyed Krakauer’s ability to spin a tale, but wasn’t thrilled with the story as a whole so I put his name on the backburner of authors I would read in the future should I come across him. Then everyone started reading Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town which brought him back to the forefront and me searching for his books – which leads to long story long HOLY SHIT HE WROTE AN EVEREST BOOK?!?!?!?!?!Please note I have zero desire to ever attempt to climb Mt. Everest (or anything higher than a flight of stairs). EVER. First, I’m fat and have resigned myself to the fact that I will always be at least a little bit so. Second, I’m terrified of heights. We’re talking I can’t climb a stepladder. And third, EVEREST. Seriously. You know what you die of on Everest? Your BRAIN F-ING SWELLING TO THE POINT WHERE YOUR EYEBALLS BULGE OUT OF YOUR HEAD. Either that or you drown on your own lung juices. Drowning in water terrifies me, drowning because I was dumb enough to attempt to climb to the height of where a jumbo jet flies is beyond my comprehension. All that being said, I did the next best thing to really make me feel part of the action – I read this book while walking at a 30% incline on my treadmill. Just like being there I’m sure . . . 

I can never wrap my brain around the fact that people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go on a vacation where there is a one in four chance of dying rather than reaching the summit. That’s cray. I also am one of the nutters who, although totally obsessed with the climbing of Everest, doesn’t really want anyone doing it. Everest is one of the natural wonders in the world – and due to the “cool factor” that one gets should they reach make it safely to the top and back down again it is also the home of 10 tons of garbage and heaping pyramids of human waste. It’s also a place where inexperienced adventure seeking overgrown children think they can buy their way to the top, but as Rob Hall (one of the expedition leaders who lost his life to the mountain) said . . . 
“With enough determination, any bloody idiot can get UP this hill. The trick is to get back down alive.”
For a price of between $50,000 to $100,000 nearly anyone can attempt to make the climb and many believe the hiring of Sherpas and the hopes of being “short-roped” if the going gets tough will let them achieve their dream. While Krakauer was lucky enough to be matched up with some experienced climbers (between Rob Hall and Scott Fischer’s groups there was TONS of publicity/advertising money at stake so they needed everyone to summit safely in order to promote their expedition companies) they were still a rag-tag team of climbers that mixed expedition leaders, guides, sherpas, a lawyer, several doctors, a personnel director, a publisher, a postal worker and a journalist together. The reality of an Everest expedition is this - once you’re at altitude and the shit hits the fan. . . 
“You might as well be on the moon.”
And with the price being one that the wealthy can easily afford (or that the middle-class can save a lifetime for in order to achieve the biggest bucketlist item out there), Mt. Everest doesn’t even have to throw the curveball of bad weather. This . . . .

is often times the kiss of death. With the summit visable from this vantage point, climbers are nearly impossible to turn around – leading to a greater chance of hypothermia, frostbite, not making the descent before dark, running out of oxygen, etc. In my opinion, it should cost a million dollars per person to climb Everest. That would be enough money for clean-up and deter the wannabe super(wo)men from attempting the climb. Because seriously, while this book was fascinating in a “watching a trainwreck” type of way – it should have served as Exhibit A of why massive changes in the rules/regulations regarding Everest needs to happen.Recommended to anyone who likes to experience adventure and defy death from the safety of their reading chair. My only advice is to familiarize yourself with the specific locations which are continually talked about with respect to the Everest climb. Places like the Lhotse Face, Khumbu Icefall or the Hillary Step. It’s easy to forget the danger that is the Khumbu Icefall if you don’t know that this is what it looks like . . .!121!I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of non-fiction. I prefer to listen to podcasts or interviews, rather than read straight-up non-fiction about a certain topic. And as someone who isn't particularly interested in climbing or sports in general, this wouldn't be a book that I'd normally read. But I'm so glad that I did.It definitely reads more like a memoir, since the author was present for the events of the story. That made it a much more palatable read for me, rather than a book about an event where the author does all the research but has no first-hand experience of the thing. However, after having read this I would definitely read anything else Krakauer has written or writes because he is such an amazing storyteller. I was never bored reading this book. He blends history and personal accounts into a gripping, harrowing, horrifying, fascinating story. It's truly awful, but I couldn't put it down. I'm not sure how I particularly feel about being so interested in reading about a tragedy like this, but I also think it opened my eyes to SO many new things that there is definitely merit to the story. On top of that, I can only imagine it was a story Krakauer felt he had to tell after having lived through it. I will definitely be recommending this book to friends and suggesting it to people who, like me, are hesitant to pick up non-fiction books that aren't memoir.!121!Utterly harrowing and propulsive. I could not put this book down. This is another book that details people's misguided quests to conquer nature--to see nature as something to be conquered. It's also another great cold-weather read, to make you realize that, really, it's not so cold out after all.!121!Into Thin Air, Jon KrakauerInto Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster is a 1997 bestselling non-fiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It details Krakauer's experience in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were killed and several others were stranded by a storm. Krakauer's expedition was led by guide Rob Hall. Other groups were trying to summit on the same day, including one led by Scott Fischer, whose guiding agency, Mountain Madness, was perceived as a competitor to Hall's agency, Adventure Consultants.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه سپتامبر سال 2010 میلادیعنوان: در هوای ر��یق؛ نویسنده: جان کراکائور؛ مترجم یحیی خوئی؛ تهران چشمه‏‫، ‏‫1387؛ در 355ص؛ مصر، نقشه، شابک 9789643624897؛ موضوع: داستان گروه‌های کوهنوردی - اورست از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20مبسوی هوای رقیق: برداشتی شخصی از فاجعه ی «کوه اورست»، یا «در هوای رقیق»، یکی از پرفروش‌ترین آثار غیرداستانی سال 1997میلادی و به قلم «جان کراکائر» است؛ این کتاب جزئیات حضور نویسنده در «کوه اورست» در خلال فاجعه ی سال 1996میلادی «کوه اورست» را به تصویر کشیده‌ است؛ جاییکه هشت کوهنورد جان باختند، و بسیاری دیگر، در طوفانی سخت، گرفتار آمدند؛ اردویی که نویسنده در آن به سر می‌برد، به رهبری «راب هال» پیش می‌رفت، در حالیکه گروه‌های دیگری نیز، در همان روز، می‌خواستند قله را فتح کنند؛ یکی از این گروه‌ها، «جنون کوه» به رهبری «اسکات فیشر» بود، که با گروه «راب»، «مشاوران ماجراجویی» رقیب به حساب می‌آمد؛ در سال 1997میلادی اقتباسی سینمایی از این کتاب، با عنوان «در هوای رقیق: مرگ در اورست» به کارگردانی «رابرت مارکویتز» ساخته شد؛ فیلم دیگری هم در مورد این فاجعه در سال 2015میلادی با عنوان «اورست» ساخته شد ،که به ادعای کارگردان، «بالتاسار کورماکور» این کتاب تنها منبع آن نبوده‌ و منابع دیگری نیز داشته استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 10/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!I call attention to Paul Bryant's entertaining review of this book:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Which itself calls attention to the several people who have died on Everest in the past WEEK, not dissuaded by this story, obviously, which every climber knows well in multiple versions. This is the thing about risk-takers, death-defiers, mountain climbers, they must do what they must do.I love this book. I listened to it on a road trip from Chicago to New Orleans on my spring break, 2004. It's funny, because spring break for northerners is often about heading south to warmth, and all I remember about the driving part of this trip south was climbing freezing cold and oxygen-starved Mount Everest as this incredibly gripping tragedy took place there. I was THERE, on that mountain. You know, some nights I get up for whatever reason in the night and I can't see anything, proceeding from my bed to the hallway and skirting the edge of the stairs on the way to pee or to soothe some nightmare-ridden kid, and I recall what some unfortunate climber did in a blinding snowstorm, unable to see, trying to make it back to his tent but plummeting off the edge of a cliff and down hundreds of feet--or was it thousands?--to his death. I never fall down the stairs. Not yet, not so far, anyway. I guess you may only have to do that once at my age. But I always think of this book, in horror. Beautifully told by Krakauer, though it became as these accounts sometimes will somewhat controversial in that some people disagree with how he characterized some of the more sensitive aspects of the events. In later editions he includes other views of some of the disputed events, other interpretations, which I think is cool. But a great book stays with you and this one stays with me. And I read very few books like this, though after that I read other books by him including Into The Wild.!121!This is a story that sounds too unlikely, too cinematic, to make up. In 1996, journalist and mountain climber Jon Kraukauer was assigned to cover an Everest ascent expedition, and chronicle the experiences of people – some experienced climbers, some not - who paid a small fortune for the chance at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Kraukauer was a member of one of three American-led climbing teams that would attempt to climb to the summit of Mt. Everest. By the time the teams made their way back to Base Camp, eleven people had died on the mountain. Kraukauer’s book describes the journey to Everest, the different people on the teams, the storm that scattered the group just below the summit, and the deadly aftermath. This book, among other things, seeks to rationalize the decisions and behaviors of some of the people in the group, and understand how so many died in such a senseless way. Kraukauer himself, because he was part of the team, isn’t an impartial witness, and the book doesn’t shy away from his own culpability – at least two of the deaths that occurred during the expedition were very likely a direct result of Kraukauer’s own actions. There are two main draws to this book: first, you get a firsthand view of what exactly goes into an Everest expedition, so you never have to actually do it yourself (seriously, DO NOT CLIMB EVEREST. EVEN IF YOU DON’T DIE (and we’ll get to that) IT’S STILL A TERRIBLE IDEA), and then you get Kraukauer’s in-depth investigation of deaths that he himself may have been instrumental in. He also attempts to explain how a person decides to climb the highest mountain in the world, and why anyone would want to do this. For me, this was the only real weak point of the book, because despite Kraukauer’s best efforts, I never once thought to myself, yeah, climbing Everest sounds like a totally reasonable thing to attempt. Seriously, Everest is bullshit and it was all I could talk about for days after finishing this book. For one thing, Everest isn’t even a difficult climb, if you look at it from a technical standpoint. It’s only hard because the high altitude will literally kill you – the climb itself is not hard. At one point, the team climbs a bunch of ladders that were tied to a rock face by a team back in the 1970s. And another fun fact I learned from this book is that there are two main ways to die on Everest: first, you can lose your footing and fall into a crevasse, or just slide right off a fucking cliff, and die instantly from the fall. This is the easy way to die on Everest. The hard way is you get altitude sickness (which is a nice way of putting it – past a certain altitude, even if you have supplemental oxygen, your brain literally starts to die) and collapse, and can’t get up. And then your team just has to LEAVE YOU THERE, because they sure as hell can’t carry you down, so you get to just lie there in the snow, fully conscious, and wait to die. And then your corpse becomes a landmark, along with all the other dead bodies that are just SITTING UP THERE. (There’s a really good My Favorite Murder podcast episode where they talk about the bodies on Everest, and it is straight-up heartbreaking.)Aside from examining his own role in the tragedy and getting others’ versions of what happened, Kraukauer also spends some time discussing whether it’s even a good idea for people to attempt Everest in the first place. Aside from the very real risk of death, Kraukauer also considers the ethics of employing local Sherpa guides, and whether supplemental oxygen ultimately helps or hurts climbers. And, on top of all of that, this book is essentially a murder investigation – Kraukauer goes over the events of the fateful day, interviews the other surviving climbers, and evaluates the decisions of the guides and what role they may have played in the tragedy. He manages to strike a good balance of not avoiding his own responsibility in the tragedy, while also reminding readers that he and the other climbers were suffering from severe oxygen deprivation, and therefore both their decision-making abilities and their memories are not fully functional. It’s easy to read Kraukauer’s other book of tragedy in the wilderness, Into the Wild, with a certain degree of superiority. Christopher McCandless died because he was woefully unprepared to survive in the wild, and his lack of knowledge and naivety killed him. But, as Into Thin Air proves, you can be a seasoned professional with thousands of successful climbs under your belt, and still die because of one stupid mistake, because Nature doesn’t care. Anyone can (and does) die on Everest, and Kraukauer’s book examines, among other things, whether it’s worth it.!121!What a read to start 2018! I enjoyed the majority of this, and I'll admit I fell down a bit of a black hole when it came to the controversy behind Krakauer's perspective. Review will be up tomorrow! :)!121!Until 2014, one of the trail markers for mountaineers climbing the Everest on the main Northeast ridge route was ""Green Boots"", the corpse of a man wearing, well, green climbing boots - yes, a dead man was an Everest landmark, and people passed him by and photographed him (I will certainly not provide links). Most likely, it was the body of Head Constable Tsewang Paljor of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police who was part of an expedition that happened in the background of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, which is the main topic of Krakauer's book. While the corpse is not at that specific place anymore, Mr. Paljor's body is presumably still somewhere up there, but no one can say with certainty - what is certain though is that the cynicism and sensationalism that ""Green Boots'"" treatment illustrates is very telling and that the impulses behind it are an underlying theme of ""Into Thin Air"". American journalist and mountaineer Jon Krakauer was part of an expedition that aimed to summit Mount Everest in May 1996, the same day as several other groups of climbers. Due to a series of unfortunate events, wrong decisions and an upcoming storm, eight mountaineers died and several got severely injured and almost froze to death. While Krakauer's account of the unfolding tragedy is certainly intriguing, the psychological dimension is what fascinated me: Why are people deciding to summit Everest, and what are the moral implications? Krakauer talks about motivational factors like a love of nature and a longing for adventure, but also vanity, the impulse to challenge oneself and the wish to stand out, all characteristics represented by members of the expeditions. Some mountaineers are unable or unwilling to question their own abilities, thus threatening the lives of other climbers and the sherpas who often risk everything for their rich clients in order to be able to feed their families. (After an ice avalanche killed 16 sherpas in 2014, the sherpas went on strike to push for better working conditions.)The commercialization of Everest is an important topic in the book: The heads of the expeditions aim to guide as many participants to the summit as possible - they assume that especially Krakauer, the reporter, and Sandy Pittmann, the society girl, will generate publicity when they get home to tell their stories. Commercial expeditions are a competitive business, and clients who pay tens of thousands of dollars to take on Everest are very motivated to make it to the top - and this tunnel vision is potentially deadly for everyone involved. On the highest mountain of the world, the lack of humility can be a death sentence. Since Krakauer wrote this book (it was published in 1997), these tendencies have become more and more extreme. John Oliver did a fantastic episode entitled ""Everest"" which talks about the current state of affairs. More and more inexperienced climbers join commercial expeditions, and now there is a also a serious problem with garbage and feces in the Himalaya. The sherpas' job becomes more and more dangerous, which is not exactly widely discussed as the rich white dilettantes want to tell heroic stories about their fearless ascent to the summit while showing numerous selfies. Oliver offers an alternative which is safer for everybody: https://www.thetopofmounteverest.com And still, I understand the urge to explore, to see and experience new environments and extreme situations, to travel to remote, beautiful, dangerous places, to try and find out how far you can go. Parts of Krakauer's book reminded me of T.C. Boyle's novel Water Music about Scottish explorer Mungo Park who was obsessed by his wish to explore West Africa - and paid a high price. In a way, Krakauer and Boyle talk about rather universal human aspirations, about the Faustian impulse to know and conquer - this disruptive impulse can be beautiful or terrible.We've discussed the book on the podcast, and you can listen to it here (in German).!121!Several authors and editors I respect counseled me not to write the book as quickly as I did; they urged me to wait two or three years and put some distance between me and the expedition in order to gain some crucial perspective. Their advice was sound, but in the end I ignored it- mostly because what happened on the mountain was gnawing my guts out. I thought that writing the book might purge Everest from my life. It hasn’t of course. But it is the way this reads, as Jon Krakauer, a client of Rob Hall’s, Adventure Consultants Guided Expedition, takes us step by brutal step up that mountain, in the spring of 1996. And back down again! Clearly the account of an anguished man desperately trying to make sense of it all, by telling it all. Not an easy task. The Everest climb had rocked my life to its core, and it became desperately important for me to record the events in complete detail. The staggering unreliability of the human mind at high altitude made the research problematic. To avoid relying excessively on my own perceptions, I interviewed most of the protagonists at great length and on multiple occasions. When possible I also corroborated details with radio logs maintained by people at base camp, where clear thought wasn’t in such short supply.Chances are I would not have read this were it not for my daughter’s unbridled enthusiasm in discussing it one Saturday morning when I was over for coffee. When I left that day Into Thin Air left with me. Hands down the greatest adventure, survivor story I have ever read. How could it not be? The author's visceral honesty in portraying his own part in this tragedy, took my breath away and lends undeniable,crediblity to this account. The plain truth is that I knew better but went to Everest anyway. And in doing so I was party to the death of good people, which is something that is apt to remain on my conscience for a very long time.!121!I absolutely loved this!! I had a feeling that I would due to my personal experience hiking and climbing in the Pacific Northwest region.""Why did you want to climb Mount Everest?""This question was asked of George Leigh Mallory, a Himalayan mountain climber in 1921.And his answer was,""Because it’s there.""This might not make sense to someone who’s not into this sport or adventure, but to me, I get it.Why do I test myself on grueling 4500’ elevation hikes or scrambles?Well, to get to the top!To challenge myself physically, mentally and sometimes emotionally to push myself up that trail. The scenery is beautiful, takes your breath away and you just can't beat it. I’ve had some of my happiest moments lost in the woods, so to speak. I do realize it's not for everyone but I tend to understand why the climbers in this book wanted to climb Mt. Everest. It gets into your blood and yeah, you get addicted to it.Especially when you get to the top!! It's a wonderful feeling of accomplishment and I'm sure marathon runners get this same high.My husband is also a hiker and climber. He has been on my case to read this book for years and I’m finally glad I did!Jon Krakauer did an excellent job writing this book. I can’t imagine it was easy to write about your own personal experience in regards to the Mt. Everest disaster. He seemed to ask himself in the book if he could have done more and blamed himself for misunderstood memories. I can’t imagine what the lack of oxygen does to a person since I’ve never experienced this phenomenon. Because of his undeniable credibility in the account of this tragedy, I’m more inclined to believe his version of the climb on May 10th, 1996.I know other accounts are out of there such as Anatoli Boukreev's book, The Climb. It's in response to Krakauer's book.I'll try to get to other books one day about this tragedy.Will I plan to read more books by Krakauer?!Hell yes I will! It's due to the fact that I’m not a non-fiction fan and this was damn good!!!121!Into Thin Air is a recollection of the tragic events of May 1996, when numerous individuals died following an ascent to the top of Everest. It is told by Jon Krakauer, a journalist and mountaineer who initially joined the expedition to write a magazine piece on the growing industry of 'guided' groups of inexperienced mountaineers.This was a fascinating memoir, that really delves deep into the disaster and the small moments of bad luck and judgement that contributed to so much death. Krakauer really makes the reader understand each and every single person who was involved, drawing on their personal histories and passion for mountaineering and bringing it to the forefront of the reader's mind. Everyone there that day had a common goal - to reach the summit, and all of them were gripped to some degree by Everest fever. The mystique of the mountain drew them all in, pushing some of them beyond the limits, and I found myself equally enthralled and incredibly anxious to find out their inevitable fate. I was also really facinated by Krakauer's descriptions of high altitude sickness, and just how debilitating it is on the body. Far from just shortness of breath, the body is subjected to horrendous migraines, blindness, hypoxia, hypothermia, intestinal issues and cerebral and pulmonary edema. The effects can be sudden, and deadly, as well as warping the mind and making a difficult journey innumerably harder as the brain become sluggish and mistakes are more likely to happen. The whole experience is utterly exhausting on body and mind, making any ascent of Everest even more amazing. Sometimes I did get confused by who was who, as the author tended to switch between first and surnames regularly - meaning I had to remember two names for an already large group. I also found it difficult to pinpoint where everyone was during certain scenes as I am unfamiliar with the layout of Everest. However, looking up some pictures of the South Col and the various Camps helped 'set the scene' in my mind. Utterly riveting, ultimately heartbreaking. Nature is a cruel mistress in the pursuit of glory.!121!One of the most horrifying things I've read in a while. The sense of doom is palpable. I knew Everest climbers are always walking past corpses but...corpses of people they knew? Infinitely worse, there's two separate descriptions of people literally walking past dying or desperate mountaineers and just *leaving* them to die because to help them would mean...not getting to the top of the pointy rock. Christ. The book is a howl of pain from someone who if only belatedly realised the human cost of getting up the pointy rock wasn't worth whatever they gained from doing so. What that gain might be, spiritual enlightenment or sense of achievement over nature or whatever, is not made clear by this author, which isn't surprising given how many people died.Let us not dwell on the super rich USian proto influencer who made Sherpas carry 80lbs of electronics up Everest so she could post the 1990s equivalent of selfies.Good lord, basically.!121!Memorable in a heartbreaking kind of way!!121!This is probably the best climbing book I have read despite the controversy surrounding some aspects. It was as enthralling as books like Endurance and as readable. I was with the author on the mountain and felt the terrible pain of the losses they endured, the guilt of the survivors and the many ""what ifs"" after the event.The author relays his personal experiences climbing Everest in 1996 with a number of groups. This was the tragic year when many of the participants didn't make it off the mountain due to a catalogue of errors and an untimely snow storm. He also documents a lot of the history of other climbs and delves into the personalities and characters of some of the great climbers. More generally, I am drawn to these adventure books and stories which hold a certain fascination. But whenever I read about the cost ($70,000 minimum,) the risk ( 1 in 4 people die in an Everest attempt) and the pain and possible life changing injuries from frost bite, I am always glad I can just read about it from the warmth and comfort of a safe altitude on dry ground.There is something unique about people who set out to achieve these goals. Krakauer describes them like thisTo become a climber was to join a self-contained, rabidly idealistic society, largely unnoticed and surprisingly uncorrupted by the world at large. The culture of ascent was characterised by intense competition and undiluted machismo, but for the most part, its constituents were concerned with impressing one another only. Getting to the top of any given mountain was considered much less important than how one got there: prestige was earned by tackling the more unforgiving routes with minimal equipment, in the boldest style imaginableI find myself wondering how they feel when it is all over. They have spent a fortune, risked everything, endured much pain, put their waiting family through a nightmare and possibly lost colleagues or friends to a gruesome death. What is it all for? Is it worth it? What are they really seeking? Reading books like this, one might suppose that most climbers do it for the beauty of the scenery or the thrill of the surroundings. However, it is clear from this book and others that these aspects very much take a back seat. Instead, it is a competition to be the best in the field and it can take over a person's life. Climbing mountains is what they dream about and ultimately what they live for. It can become an obsession in the same way that sport or work or any other hobby can. That is when it becomes dangerous and purposeless.God created each of us with a vacuum that only He can fill. Man will seek to deny this and seek pleasure and fulfillment in many places other than God. These things then become idols. They must be kept in their proper place and we need to keep a proper perspective.This is a great book. The strong language is not so great hence the less than perfect rating. There is no sexual content and no violence. There are upsetting scenes of death.!121!I'm just going to come out and say it: I just don't get it.Even after reading this book, I just cannot understand why anybody would want to climb Everest. If nobody had ever done it before, I could understand it from the perspective of exploration and new discoveries, but this is a mountain that has now been climbed so often it has a serious garbage problem. From Jon Krakauer's descriptions in this book, it actually sounds like a bit of a shithole (or the opposite of a hole, I suppose).Krakauer lists several different, contradictory statistics on how likely you are to die climbing Everest, but they were all far too high in my opinion, especially for something that's essentially a pointless exercise. I mean, I do understand that it's impossible to live a life free from risk... but there's a big difference between necessary risks and playing Russian Roulette and climbing Everest seems no different to me than pointing a gun at your head with one bullet in the chamber and pulling the trigger. It serves no more purpose to society and is just as dangerous.Ah, maybe I'm just a grumpy old bastard with no sense of adventure! Who knows? However, when reading about this horrible tragedy on the slopes of Everest, the fact that their being there in the first place was essentially completely unnecessary just compounds the tragedy for me.Krakauer certainly brings the whole affair to life; when reading this book I actually felt chilled to the bone at times. It was a harrowing read and a powerful one. I actually cried at his descriptions of how his teammates lost their lives.There were aspects of his writing I wasn't that keen on. For example, I wish he hadn't kept referring to people by their first names one time, then their surnames the next time they were mentioned and then, in one case, even their nickname. If he'd been consistent in referring to them just by one name throughout I wouldn't have had to keep flipping to the list of participants at the front of the book to remind myself who he was talking about. Maybe the fault is with my memory rather than his writing; benefit of the doubt and all that.I also didn't like the lengthy post script that dealt with his battle with one of the other climbers about the veracity of their different accounts. I can see the need to mention it, but not at such great length! A whole tenth of the book is taken up by this bickering-heavy post script! It was ugly and left me with a bad taste in my mouth as I finished the book.All in all, I'm glad I read this, but I very much doubt I'd ever want to read it again. Such a senseless loss of human life with, as the author himself states, absolutely no lessons learned from it. Tragic.!121!If climbing Mt. Everest is on your bucket list, you might reconsider after reading this book. The author does a wonderful job of describing his harrowing experience.!121!Interesting book, didn’t know a lot the accident before reading it (only have heard of it vaguely). I honestly don’t get the thrill of climbing such peaks especially since the fatalities aren’t few. Or at least the extra danger climbers might put themselves through. But hey, don’t worry they’ll pay someone to carry all of their junk! Rtc.!121!***NO SPOILERS*** May 10, 1996 was a very, very bad day to be climbing to “the roof of the world.” On that day, journalist and avid mountain climber Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest with a group as part of a guided expedition. He was on assignment for “Outside” magazine and was one of the few in his group to survive this expedition after a ferocious storm hit out of the blue. Into Thin Air is as much a meticulous detailing of this tragedy as it is a personal catharsis: “ . . . what happened on the mountain was gnawing my guts out. I thought that writing the book might purge Everest from my life.”For those who know little to nothing about climbing Mt. Everest (or mountain climbing in general) Into Thin Air is a good place to start. There’s a lot that’s covered, and Krakauer’s a very well-organized writer who didn’t skimp on the details necessary to bring to life the reality of high-altitude climbing. It’s pretty grim, at best: Mt. Everest climbers are guaranteed to encounter plenty of corpses on their journey to the summit (there are now more than 235 on the mountain); they must travel across crevasses via metal ladders; and they’ll struggle for breath more and more the higher they climb. The harshest reality? That one in ten dies. This climb could be ultimate adventure or agonizing death. Krakauer explained all this in a highly engaging, vivid manner. At no time is any of this dry, and even for those who aren’t outdoors types, Into Thin Air will prove compelling. Something Krakauer made clear early on is how very crucial adequate acclimatization is. No climber arrives at the foot of the mountain and just starts climbing. Climbing is done in a series of organized phases, with climbers climbing to and resting for a few days at a series of five camps located at increasing altitudes on the mountain. He also gave lots of attention to the growing commercialization of climbing Mt. Everest, and it’s fascinating to read about. This awe-inspiring mountain may be a natural wonder, but access to it is far from free. Anyone who wishes to climb it must fork over tens of thousands of dollars, and most climb as part of guided expeditions. Though Krakauer is a journalist, his style is never unfeeling or distant. Intermingled with climbing facts and thorough portraits of the other climbers on the mountain are his own musings, fears, and personal admissions. A few times he wondered whether he was being snobby in his judgments of the others in his group; he described crushing, altitude-induced headaches so excruciating that even moving his eyeballs hurt; he struggled greatly with survivor’s guilt after so many of his new friends died hideous deaths. At one point, thinking about a missing friend that he’d spent an hour searching for in vain: “I fell to my knees with dry heaves, retching over and over as the icy wind blasted against my back.”Krakauer was so forthright and unafraid to share his lowest moments and the feelings of guilt that consumed him that I also felt that anguish. There’s simply no way not to empathize with him. To my disbelief, some critics have called Krakauer “cowardly” and “selfish.” I can only wonder exactly how much better they'd behave under the same horrendous circumstances.On the surface, Into Thin Air is a story about mountain climbing and tragedy, but deep down it’s an emotional survival story. It has a universal resonance. All lovers of nonfiction--outdoorsy or not--will want to read this.!121!Does your dream holiday involve spending north of fifty grand to risk a fatal aneurysm, walk past the dead bodies of weaker adventurers who’ve come before you and possibly lose your fingers, toes and nose, if not your life? If so, then step right up to climb Mount Everest!Seriously though, If you’ve ever thought you might like to climb Everest, read this book. If you still want to attempt the highest mountain in the world after finishing Into Thin Air, you are a braver person than I.This is a masterful account of an adventure-turned-disaster that cost the lives of eight people, and scarred (both physically and psychologically) the lucky survivors.If you've read Joe Simpson’s Touching The Void you have some understanding of the horrors of mountaineering gone wrong. Into Thin Air similarly deals with a climbing catastrophe but with the horrifying struggle consuming an entire group of climbers instead of a lone individual.Jon Krakauer, a seasoned mountaineer, joined a 1996 expedition to Everest with experienced guides who had reached the mountaintop on numerous occasions with previous groups.You would think that only the best of the best attempt Everest. The toughest, fittest, most experienced mountain-crazy hardasses out there. Alas, you would be wrong. As Krakauer details, the guides that led people up the mountain often weren’t as picky as they should have been, as theirs is a business like any other, and a need for customers led to many expeditions shepherding weaker sheep up the perilous slopes of the Himalayas.What follows is a sad tale of bad luck, bad judgement, and many, many massive screw-ups that lead to eight people dying awful deaths in the snow after getting caught in bad weather and simply running out of strength in ‘The Death Zone’ (doesn’t that sound like a fantastic holiday location? The South of France has nothing on Everest) above 8000 meters, where even the strongest person can have unpredictable and fatal reactions to the low air pressure.Krakauer writes with clarity and humanity, giving us a window seat to how everything goes so wrong, and both the heroism and foolishness that occurs in such trying circumstances. He doesn’t shy away from his own feelings of guilt, and the way that what happened on the upper reaches of Everest has impacted his life.Into Thin Air is a gripping, terrifying and informative story that taught me more about mountaineering and its risks than any other book I’ve read. It’s an amazing story, both well told and memorable. Read this book, and prepare to shiver in imagined cold as you walk with Krakauer through the middle of a sub-zero high-altitude disaster.Postscript: I read this book as I headed to Ladakh in the Indian Himalayas. Krakauer discusses in detail the effect that high altitude can have on perception, memory and the ability to focus, and when I stopped at a driveable pass on my trip that reached 5600m I experienced this firsthand. Within minutes I felt nauseous, disassociated from my surroundings, and in need of some serious sleep. How anyone dares to face the perils of altitudes above six kilometres is beyond me.","['Nonfiction', 'Adventure', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'History', 'Survival']"
The Glass Castle (Paperback),Jeannette Walls,4.31,1202982,2005,"THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERThe Glass Castle is a remarkable memoir of resilience and redemption, and a revelatory look into a family at once deeply dysfunctional and uniquely vibrant. When sober, Jeannette's brilliant and charismatic father captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn't want the responsibility of raising a family. The Walls children learned to take care of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be homeless even as their children prospered.The Glass Castle is truly astonishing--a memoir permeated by the intense love of a peculiar but loyal family.","My sister saw The Glass Castle on my coffee table and said, “Oh, I read that. It’s kind of . . .” then she paused and we both were awkwardly silent for a minute. “Well, I was going to say, it’s kind of like us, a little bit, but not –““Yeah,” I said. “I wasn’t going to say it – because not all of it – ““Yeah, not all of it.”We didn’t talk about it again. When I first saw this book, I think I died a little inside because of the cover. I didn’t hate The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood like I hated The Mermaid Chair or (*shudder*) Bastard out of Carolina, but when there’s a little girl on the cover of a book, looking all innocent, it’s like a movie with the word “Education” in the title. You just know you’re in for a published trip to the psychiatrist’s couch. Kiddy-sex and soul-searching. I’m not saying people shouldn’t tell their stories (I mean, look at me, I’m all up in your website telling my stories), but I do think people should get a handle on what their story is before they try to tell it. Or at least before they make me read it. Sorry, that’s kind of asshole-ish of me to say, but I just think a lot of books with innocent little girls on the cover are really arrogant. They have this sense that since some man did something horrifying, everything that women do, including dancing around a fire with girlfriends or taking exotic lovers, is just part of the loving circle of nature’s healing. I am such a fan of women, and so I take it personally when we look like morons. This book has absolutely nothing in common with its cover. I haven’t written a review of it before because I think it is a perfect book, and how do you review a perfect book? I’m like Wayne and Garth when they meet Alice Cooper. This book is my Alice Cooper. I’m sure it wouldn’t be everyone’s Alice Cooper, but to me this is exactly what a book should be. Everything about the book is simple, concise, and action-packed. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry. The people are incredible, but deep and smart and human. In some ways, I think this book is the Great American Story, but it’s the story none of us talk about and all of us live. In other ways, the book is so specific and personal to the Walls family that I never would have imagined the stories if I had not been told them. Virginia Woolf and Rainer Maria Rilke, two of the wisest people I have read, both ask when and how women will be able to tell stories without being self-conscious that they are women. How can we write, or even live, not as reactions to men, but as separate masters of our own experiences? I don’t know where the genders are on the space/time continuum of respecting each other, and I think there are probably gender-related specifics to any story (maybe that’s just natural and not even bad), but there is something about this book that is just human and strong. It is compassionate and unflinching. Oh, I hate adjectives. Just, read the first chapter of this book, and if you don’t think it’s compelling, don’t keep reading because it’s probably not for you. My family was nomadic, like Jeannette Walls’s family, but, like I say, all of her stories, and my stories, are unique. When I last lived with my parents, it struck me that we never really understand other people’s relationships with each other. I grew up, probably as many of us did, thinking that my parents never really got along and that my mom was a victim of my dad’s anger and wild scheming. But, later, I realized they probably both got something that I never understood out of their relationship. I think a lot of this book is about how we know the people we are close to and, also, never really do – how it is useless to hold other people to our own standards of what love or responsibility looks like. But, still, it is about holding each other responsible. Or, maybe the book is just about her family with no real moral lesson at all. Walls is so loyal to her stories in an almost scientific way. None of the adult outrage that contaminates so many stories of children creeps into Walls’s. She tells you what happened, and maybe how she felt about it at the time, but she doesn’t impose emotion on the reader. Here’s just a small part (well, actually, half . . . I couldn’t resist) of the first chapter to give you a little taste:Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She’d made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men’s shoes. She’d washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime.She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. “It’s my baby girl!” she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. “A little snack for later on,” she explained.We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. “You know how I love my seafood,” she said.She started talking about Picasso. She’d seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn’t really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period.“I’m worried about you,” I said. “Tell me what I can do to help.”Her smile faded. “What makes you think I need your help?”“I’m not rich,” I said. “But I have some money. Tell me what it is you need.”She thought for a moment. “I could use an electrolysis treatment.”“Be serious.”“I am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good.”“Come on, Mom.” I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. “I’m talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better.”“You want to help me change my life?” Mom asked. “I’m fine. You’re the one who needs help. Your values are all confused.”“Mom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago.”“Well, people in this country are too wasteful. It’s my way of recycling.” She took a bite of her Seafood Delight. “Why didn’t you say hello?”“I was too ashamed, Mom. I hid.”Mom pointed her chopsticks at me. “You see?” she said. “Right there. That’s exactly what I’m saying. You’re way too easily embarrassed. Your father and I are who we are. Accept it.”“And what am I supposed to tell people about my parents?”“Just tell the truth,” Mom said. “That’s simple enough.”It’s been a while since I read this book, so a lot of the stories aren’t fresh in my mind, but some are so vivid to me that I think of them whenever I see a trash can or think of the desert. In high school, I thought that American history was the most boring topic imaginable. Then, in college, I took a class called the History of Women in the U.S., and I realized that I think the history of industry and conquest is mind-numbing, but the history of actual people is riveting. The Glass Castle is a real, honest history (or as honest as histories can be) of people in America. It is so close to me and so foreign in just the way this country is. It is also, in a way, a tribute to family oral histories. My dad has a . . . loose . . . relationship with the truth, as I’ve probably mentioned on this site before. In the past couple of years, every time I see one of my siblings, we sit around and tell stories from my dad or about my dad, trying to weed out what actually happened, what got a nice polish in the story factory, and what is an outright lie. I get that same feeling from this book – of siblings sitting around and saying, “Do you remember . . .” and “You weren’t there this one time . . .” or “No, that’s just what Dad said happened, what actually happened was . . .” I’m sure someday, my siblings and I will put together a history of our own, since every one of us seems to have inherited the storytelling gene. Whatever I write will be in some way inspired by this book.!121!Now I get why people like this memoir so much.Though it is a memoir and a true story, both the writing style and the way Walls reminisces about her childhood make it seem like more of a fairy tale. My favourite non-fiction books are those that don't lose the compelling flow of a good fiction book - that still pull you into another world and life, dragging you along for the ride. This is one of those.I especially liked reading about Walls' complex and conflicting thoughts about her parents and childhood. When she's writing about her youth, she writes with the rose-tinted glasses of a young girl who loves her family; as she grows, she begins to see the shadows of reality creeping in - her father's alcoholism, her mother's selfish behaviour, the lack of food in the cupboards as a parental failure and not a normality. And, through it all, she still loves her parents. She remembers her father as an intelligent man full of fantastical stories, and her mother as a spirited artist. It's interesting, though, how differently I felt toward them. Normally, a convincing story has me feeling the same way as the narrator, but even though I could understand Walls's love for her parents, I despised them for being selfish and neglectful. I hated them for allowing a 3 year old to use the stove (and cause herself serious burns). I felt extreme anger, not love and understanding, towards them.But that's not a criticism. The Glass Castle is a beautifully-written, emotional read. A true bildungsroman, full of dark and happy times.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store!121!Another Update: I just saw the movie!!! I liked it! Woody Harrelson - Brie Larsonand Naomi Watts were all great! I thought they got the important 'duel' emotions just right. On one end - the parents did not 'protect' their kids appropriately at all-- lots of crazy dangerous chaos- On the other end - there was no question the parents loved wholeheartedly their children AND there were 'some' great gifts they gave their children - so our emotions are 'mixed'. At the end of the movie when they show the real -Jeanette Walls & her mom- plus wonderful photos of the kids growing up... it's very touching? Update: I just read some place that a movie is being made of this book. I want to share something about my relationship with ""The Glass Castle"" --that I've shared with a few people on this site --but never with the larger community. I read this book in 2006. It was a gift from a friend. She mailed it to me from New York. She said...""YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK"". The book had only been out about a week. I wasn't much of a reader.My friend knew me well --knew about my childhood --and said ....""you 'will' read this book"".Paul and I were leaving for Harbin Hot Springs --a regular -'get-a-way' place for us at the time. I took ""The Glass Castle"" with me. I mentioned in my other 'little' review --that I read it while sitting under a tree. The author became my hero! What I 'didn't' say was .....""I then read another book, right away""! I liked it too! Then another book... Then another! I HAD *NOT* BEEN A READER UNTIL THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!I'm not saying this was the best book in the entire world -(but it was great),- but I'm saying 'something' happened to me. I have been reading book-after-book -after -book (never NOT reading a book) --since 2006!!!Looking back, I'm 'thankful' the following few books were all good experiences. Had they been awful books....I might not have kept reading. Having several good books under my belt, if I hit a book I didn't like later on, --I didn't worry any longer. I knew reading was enjoyable. I felt comfort in ways I couldn't explain. I wanted to call my long time friend 'reader' friends from Jr. High School (Lisi, Renee, Ron) ---friends who were always reading --and say.....""why didn't you tell me""? ""why didn't you tell me how intimate -personal - WONDERFUL - READING WAS? ------Now, as an adult, I was not reading for a class....or a grade. I wasn't reading to please anyone!!!!I'm still clear I have holes in my education. I KNOW I'm a LATE BLOOMER READER.....(For many many years of reading these past years --I still wasn't sure if I would call myself a reader --I just knew I was always reading)Point is ---I found READING ---LATE IN LIFE!!! (Its NEVER TOO LATE).Nobody can take away something you really enjoy! I may not be the smartest cookie in the room --- but I'mhonored to 'be-in-the-room'!!!I love to hear from THE FLASHLIGHT READERS!!! Oh my gosh --you guys have such great 'childhood' reading memories. I melt hearing them. (sometimes cry).I love to hear from the READERS whose parents read to you OFTEN as a child.I love to hear about books YOUR parents gave youI love to hear about books Members share with their childrenI love to CHAT about books we love together (this si get to participate 'with you now) I love to read 'too'!If I left this site tomorrow ---I'd still have reading -- I'd still have friends to chat about with about books.Its real now -- -- I read! THIS BOOK --(for whatever reason) --- kicked my new reading- habit into high gear!!! ----So, I'm very thankful to Jeannette Walls --she changed my life!  Any 3 year old who tries to cook her own hot dog on the kitchen stove alone (my god -bless the little girl Jeannette was) --has me melting in the palm of her hands. Thanks --its never too late to become a reader! ------------------------------------------------------------------------Agree with my friend, Victoria!!! (who just read the book and wrote a 5 star review)5 stars!!!I read this book sittng under a tree at Harbin Hot Springs one summer --Jeannette Walls became my hero!!121!This memoir has to be one of the most unique memoirs I’ve ever read. My review might contain spoilers.Jeannette Walls shares the raw and honest story of her childhood leading up to adulthood. She was raised in a highly dysfunctional family with her three siblings. Her parents were like nomads and just couldn’t really settle down. Jeannette’s mother loved to read, paint, and had a teaching degree, but most of the time she refused to work. She viewed work as a waste of time. Her dad was a very intelligent man who did indeed work off and on, but he was an alcoholic and at times abusive. He had delusions of grandeur and thought he could find scads of gold to get rich and build the family a glass castle.“When Dad wasn’t telling us about all the amazing things he had already done, he was telling us about the wondrous things he was going to do. Like build the Glass Castle.” Regardless of their living conditions, whether the children had clothes or food to eat, and regardless of their safety, nothing seemed to faze Jeannette’s parents. They expected their children to find ways to take care of themselves. Jeannette was often thrust into doing adult things as a child, beginning with cooking hotdogs on the stove at the young age of three, resulting in multiple serious burns on her body and leading to a hospital stay. This is just the beginning.“Just remember,” Mom said after examining the blisters, “what doesn’t kill you will make you stronger.” “If that was true, I’d be Hercules by now,” Lori said.”I had multiple emotions throughout reading this book. It obvious after reading Jeannette’s story that her parents have some serious mental health issues. It’s unclear what type of upbringing her father received, but there may have been some abuse that he never truly got over. I felt that I could somewhat relate to this (having an alcoholic father myself), but it’s always been such a challenge for me to accept a person’s past as an excuse for their behavior today. As for Jeannette, she’s just the opposite, and very forgiving toward her parents. Throughout the book you don’t always get a sense of how she’s feeling. You can tell certain times when she gets older that she experiences anger toward both parents, but she rarely cries and is so incredibly strong and resilient. She never stops loving her parents, but her and her siblings know that eventually they have to devise a plan to get away.Being a parent is hard and I surely don’t want to criticize Jeannette’s parents (nobody’s perfect), but I had such a hard time understanding some of their decisions. Aside from the neglect and starvation, when it came to exposing the children to dangerous people–deliberately putting them in harm’s way–I had serious issues. It went too far at that point and I had a very difficult time reading those parts, but at the same time, I found myself more accepting of some of their morals. After all, nothing good can come from hating someone in your heart.“I hate Erma,” I told Mom…“You have to show compassion for her…” She added that you should never hate anyone, even your worst enemies. “Everyone has something good about them,” she said. “You have to find the redeeming quality and love the person for that.”Their parents do love them and the children learn a great deal from them including multiple survival skills. They develop a love for reading, and they also learned ways to entertain themselves. They learn responsibility and how to care for themselves because nobody else is going to do it for them. They experience adventure and there are, without a doubt, some wonderful family times together, but some extremely scary times as well. Obviously it’s good to have children who are self-reliant, but there were some huge risks taken. Just where do you draw the line?This book is written really well and I could barely put it down. I didn’t want it to end and craved more. Jeannette is an amazing writer and the fact that she is so caring and forgiving of her parents is heartwarming. Her love for them is unconditional. Rather than turn bitter about her upbringing, she’s a very positive person and she’s taught me a lot about family, perseverance, and forgiveness after reading her story. If you haven’t read this book yet, I highly recommend it. I haven’t seen the movie yet, but I honestly can’t wait.5*****!121!It took me a while to get into this book, but there's a lot of interesting family dynamics and complicated familial love despite all the awful things that happened. I think this book would feel more complete if the author had written more personal insights rather than recounting things that happened. I want to read more about her reflections of the events that happened, her emotions, and how she processes her feelings towards her family.!121!I guess I have a somewhat different frame of reference than several of the reviewers here. I can relate to many of the lessons she learned, and as such, I never had an issue believing her. These things can and do happen. The system fails children, and addicts (whether they're addicted to alcohol or excitement) will seek their fix above all else. As long as the addiction is in the picture, the person just doesn't exist. Children in alcoholic families eventually become aware of this, and the sooner they ""get it"" the better for them. In the book, this is nowhere more clearly evidenced than in the case of Walls' youngest sister, who spent the least amount of time in the presence of her parents dysfunction, and yet was finally the most crippled of all the children.Of course, I admit, I have a firmly-seated belief that the strongest and most creative of personalities are forged in fire; Maureen just didn't get burned enough to see the necessity of making a different life for herself. That, and she was separated from her other siblings by so many years that they took care of her more than they tried to include her in their effort to survive.I loved this book. Walls' short (but revealing) scenes were detail and character-driven, and there were several times I caught myself chuckling at some absolute absurdity or marveling at an unexpected bit of wisdom from someone who should have been a totally unreliable source. And I guess that's one of the main things I came away with after reading this book. Wisdom can come from anyone...whether we like them or not. And the trick to surviving is to take those things that make us better and stronger with us, and to leave the rest behind.!121!Who here has seen the show Shameless? (I am thinking of the American version, but I know there is a British one, too, that it is based on.) To me, that show could have been inspired by this memoir. Frank Gallagher and Rex Walls are the same guy!I enjoyed all the vignettes from Jeannette Walls' life. She did a great job throwing them all together to create a story even without a specific plot. I am not sure that any of the stories lasted more than a few pages, but each one of them was interesting and important in its own way.I listened to the book and it was great because it was was read by the author. I think that this is how all audio memoirs should be. Also, I thought it was interesting that although some of the stories made me want to reach through the speaker and shake her parents, she told the story without any positive or negative inflection. It was like she was saying, ""here is my story, you decide how you want to be affected by it.""I believe that most people will enjoy this book. Some might be frustrated. Others might be brought to tears. But, in the end, I think there is a little something for everyone here.!121!What I loved about this book is this: it presents her parents, with all their faults, and the poor mentality, at its worst, without anger, exasperation, or even really any judgment, just with the quirky love we all view our own childhoods. If she had been bitter in her description it would not have been believable, but instead it was tinged with forgiveness making me respect her for not only surviving such a strange childhood to become a successful, even functioning, adult but for being able to view her past with impartiality. What was thought-provoking for me was the idea that if you think you're a victim you are and if you don't you're not. As appalling as her mother's reaction was to her troubles, it's true. We do overprotect our children at the price of their own growth sometimes. And in this society we are on the jumpy side when it comes to misconduct, but telling someone they have been victimized isn't always best for them. It's not empowering. We've gone so much to the other extreme that it was good to reconsider a sway more toward center. There has to be a medium where we aren't making children grow up as toddlers but also not sheltering them from making their own decisions until their adults.There are also a lot of class ""poor"" mentalities in the book. The way the family never planned for the future as in aimed to use any gift or income to exponentially improve their lives, but horded means until they ran out. They tore down what they had until it ran out. They lived day to day. They took advantage when they could. The old adage that you give a man a fish he'll eat for a day but teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime is moot. They were not concerned with bettering their station in life only getting all they could out of it today.I found it strange that both parents were so highly intelligent and capable and yet they chose to be homeless. It bothered me that they thought the best existence would be to throw their burdens on society and let it care for them without realizing, or caring, that someone was paying and working for their existence. It bothered me that they didn't think of their children's welfare above their own but used them like they would any other member of society. At times I found my blood boiling at the actions of her parents. That's what dysfunction will do to you.And yet, she presents the incidents without anger or hurt. It happened. It shaped her glasses of the world. But the past isn't a happy place to live. She took what good she could from her experience (or bad to learn from) and moved determinedly from a childhood she didn't enjoy into an adulthood she could pick. And that's what a memoir should do: show us the past to affect the future, not to give us a place to live.!121!The warning is this: If you are going to become parents you must simply forego being too bohemian. Otherwise your children might grow up to be super successful & you will end up eating trash off dark alleyways...Peculiar upbringings are what memoirs are made of! We saw this in the Frank McCourt gray & sad ""Angela's Ashes"" & even more so in any of the Augusten Burroughs books (mainly ""Running with Scissors""). When memoirs are like this, invigoratingly Roald Dahlesque in painting pictures of past predicaments... and obviously the survival of the protagonist, the reader reads on. No matter how bad you have it, someone somewhere sometime probably had it worse.The Walls children (3 of the 4 at least) become inspired by their nomadic parents, wanting to be so unlike their progenitors that they actually turn their lives around. Here is testament of someone living way under the poverty level in modern times & getting out alive & a smarter woman for it. That she appreciates it and maintains a smile is the very heart of this non-fic gem.PS--Can't wait to see the movie.

Too much ""look at how horrible things were!"" and not enough detail or challenges to make me really care.The same stories are told and re-told throughout the memoir novel, and they rely too much on symbolism for my taste. I don't know how many times The Glass Castle is mentioned, but it was clear enough the first time we're told about it. Yes, I get it. Pretty shiny vulnerable fragile fortress - drunk father whose fantasies are selfish and unstable. Mother who's out to lunch. No money - just imaginations. Okay. Got it.Then, before we really have connected to any of the characters in their youth, we fast forward to today's NYC in which lo and behold, the storyteller is a successful writer. Gag.Basically, this book is a pale imitation of The Liar's Club. Karr's book is a jump off a cliff into a bravely realized memoir with enormous depth in the details, not to mention the writer's conflicted feelings about the meaning of father, of mother, of family, of self. By being so specific about her life and her family's life, Karr touches us deeply about family and self, too.Walls had an interesting life, but the story reads like someone else's family's trip. So that's why I'm giving it a 2. :)!121!""The Glass Castle"" is a memoir written by gossip columnist Jeanette Walls, which details her unconventional childhood growing up with an alcoholic father and a mother who seems to be mentally ill. Walls begins the book by explaining what has prompted her to write about her family: after she has ""made it"" and become a successful writer living in New York, she comes across her mother picking trash out of a dumpster and, in shame, slinks down in her taxi seat and pretends not to see or know her. Later, Walls confronts her mother, asking what she is supposed to tell people about her parents, and her mother replies, ""Just tell the truth. That’s simple enough.""Of course, ""The Glass Castle"" is anything but simple, as Walls attempts to come to terms with her upbringing. The first third of the memoir deals with her young childhood on the west coast, as her parents live as nomads, moving frequently between desert towns, always seeking the next adventure. Walls' mother is the key figure we meet here: an artist and a writer, she seems to live in her own world and doesn't express much concern in the practical realities of raising her children. In a key passage, Walls' mother takes the kids with her to give them art lessons, as she paints and studies the Joshua tree. Walls tells her mother of her plan to dig up the tree, replant it, and protect it so it can go straight. Walls' mother admonishes her, ""You'd be destroying what makes it special. It's the Joshua tree's struggle that gives its beauty."" This appears to be Walls' mother's philosophy of life – looking for the next struggle – as the family willingly gives up its nice residence in Phoenix that Walls' mother had inherited from her family to move to the father's home town – a depressed coal town in West Virginia.The family's time in West Virginia makes up the next third of the story and depicts a depressed life in a depressed town. It is in West Virginia where the family seems to drift apart, particularly Walls' father, who up to this point, had been worshipped and revered by his daughter. Like Walls' mom, her dad has a lot of imagination; while he takes odd jobs that never last long, his real dream is to strike it rich with one of his inventions. He promises, once he has found his gold, that he is going to build a ""glass castle"" – his most special project – a great big house for the family to live in. Once in West Virginia, Walls and her brother figure they will make the best of the situation, and they spend a month digging a hole in the ground to serve as the foundation for the glass castle. But because the family can't pay for trash collection, their father instructs them instead to use the hole for the family's garbage. Although she has always been her father's defender, Walls grows disillusioned with her father, eventually telling him he will never build the glass castle.Determined not to end up like her parents, Walls moves to New York, where the last third of the book transpires. It is here that Walls ""makes it,"" graduating from college, gaining employment as a writer, marrying a rich husband, and settling into a Park Avenue apartment. Interestingly, while Walls has rejected her parents' lifestyle, it is now their turn to reject hers. Her father refuses to visit the Park Avenue apartment, while her mother, after visiting the apartment, asks Walls, ""Where are the values I raised you with?"" At this point, it is a mystery what values Walls actually possesses. By crafting the memoir around stories of her childhood, we as readers are often troubled, not just because of the content of the stories but because the stories don't provide much in the way of reflection or introspection. It is, in fact, unclear what Walls actually does value – will she continue to identify success with the material trappings of her ""normal"" life in New York, or will she ultimately reject the conventional life, as her parents did? Without more reflection from Walls, particularly in this concluding section of the book, readers are left to their own interpretation of ""the truth"" about her parents – are they just a drunk father and a lazy mother, or is there something more to it? The ""Glass Castle"" is an addicting page-turner that should captivate any reader. However, without this reflection and introspection from Walls about her childhood, the book misses an opportunity to make a more lasting impact on readers and ultimately fails to reach the level of a work like ""Angela’s Ashes."" In the end, it is up to readers to make up their own minds about ""the truth"" of Walls' parents and her upbringing and what it all means. I chose to discount some of her parents' flaws and instead read this book as an homage to her parents. To me, the key passage in the book is when Walls visits a classmate's home in West Virginia and sees the empty walls in the house (in stark contrast to her own home, which is cluttered with paintings and books and decorations) and rejects the notion that her classmate's father, passed out on the couch, bares any resemblance to her own father. After Walls recounts the story to her family, her mother replies that she should show compassion for her classmate because not everybody has ""all the advantages you kids do."" Although the statement is ironic on its face, as the family fights over the crumbs of a chocolate bar, the distinction is clear: Walls' family may not provide her with much in the way of tangible goods, but they give her things that are more lasting – a belief in herself, a passion for reading and writing, an appreciation for things a lot of us take for granted, and most of all love. In the end, it was not important whether her parents actually built her a glass castle. It was that they gave her the idea of a glass castle. By overcoming her shame for her parents and writing this memoir, Walls seems to recognize this truth about her parents – that, like the Joshua tree, there was beauty in their struggle.!121!This book really made me angry--why can people who have absolutely no business having kids be able to have four?Let me backtrack...In the beginning, the Walls family is always on the run. The father is an alcoholic, who is intelligent, but believes everything upon everything is a conspiracy. He can't get a job because of the mafia, the government, the gestapo...The mother has a teaching degree, but chooses to be an artist. The family is barely able to scrape by; the father spends any money they have on alcohol, the kids barely eat, and all this time, the mother sits around, doing nothing but reading. In fact, at one point, the 12 year old narrator Jeannette tells her mother that she needs to get a job, and her mother says that it's ""not fair"" that she has to work. Later, when Jeannette suggests that her mother get a job and home with a wealthy family and take care of the kids, her mother says, ""I've spent my whole life taking care of people! I just want to take care of me.""Perhaps now you can see why this book made me so angry. I know that there are people like Jeannette's parents who feed their children margarine sandwiches and tell them to go to the bathroom in a bucket that is dumped outside because there's no indoor plumbing and the ""toilet"" is already completely filled. I know that these people exist, but I still can't believe it. A part of me was hoping that Walls pulled a James Frey and made a lot of this up, but another part of me realizes she probably didn't.Despite the knot in the pit of my stomach, I enjoyed the book. After all, only a book this engaging and well-written could spark such a vivid and real response. It's a quick and easy read, and despite how angry I was for most of it, the book gave me hope that no matter how messed up a person's childhood is, he/she can still end up as a normal, productive part of society.!121!Why is it that I hated this book when everyone else thinks it was good? It annoyed me on so many levels. I kept thinking to myself....""alright, I get it...life sucks, move on"". I just have so little sympathy and empathy sometimes, especially in books, that this just IRKED me. Sure, the writing was well done, the prose effective, the story was a bit enchanting...I just could NOT understand why this book got such great reviews. In fact, the reviews is why I kept reading it. Had someone else thought it was CRAP I would have put it down without finishing. Walls whines and complains through the whole book about how difficult her childhood was, yet she was still able to be admitted to an IVY LEAGUE school. Ok, my childhood wasn't as bad as hers, I am bright, yet I hadn't the je ne se quoi to get into an Ivy league. Perhaps, the editor deleted a HUGE chapter in her memoir which would have filled the gap between living in a weatherproof shack and going to college, but it just didn't do it for me. Okay, so most people will likely bash me for being an idiot, but I really don't care. It annoyed me. That's all for my rant...thanks for your time. :)!121!Overly-Woke to Family ValuesJeanette Walls should not be alive. Her actuarial chance of surviving was close to zero in her Keystone Cops version of childhood. With two dipsy parents, one a violent drunk, the other a spaced-out avatar of Vishnu, she had experiences which the SAS would have had difficulty enduring. Severe scalding, scorpion bites, being thrown from a moving car, locked in the back of a truck for fourteen hours, incipient starvation, drowning, and mauling by a cheetah, not to mention numerous punctures, falls, fights, and a questionable diet - these were routine events before she turned eight years old. Medical care was for sissies according to dad. And according to mother “Fussing over children who cry only encourages them.”Both mom and dad were fantasists, and therefore good story-tellers. Their poverty, instability, inability to create social relationships, they claimed, were a blessing. The children could grow up hardened to the world’s oppression. And boy was there a lot of that. Dad was paranoid about the FBI, the CIA, and all the other members of the police-gestapo who were out to get him. But, hey, the constant need to be ready to ‘skedaddle’ from any temporary home in some God-forsaken mining shanty town was an opportunity to see the country wasn’t it? An education in itself really. And dad’s get-rich-quick ideas for gold-mining were sure to pay off just as soon as he could get the necessary capital together at the Las Vegas craps tables.Walls inherited her father’s story-telling gene. She writes with wit and humour about a deplorable life with incompetent and psychotic parents. I find this distressing. The issue is not one of an acceptably eccentric alternative life style, or of an odd upbringing being overcome, or of children loving their parents in tough circumstances. It’s patently about unnecessary and avoidable abuse. Walls’s wit and humour romanticize her life. The poignancy of her portrayal of the caring dad after he almost killed her yet again, with no apparent irony much less sarcasm, is typical: ""’You don't have to worry anymore, baby,’ Dad said. ‘You're safe now.’” This makes her book popular. And it may provide a way for her to deal with the effects of her childhood. It will certainly make a good film. But the fact is that on her testimony her parents are criminally irresponsible people who are lucky they weren’t caught and prosecuted. If it were an episode of SVU, Benson would have nailed them.!121!This is not a review. There are already thousands of those. Instead, I present an anecdote.I read this in 2008 for my now-defunct neighborhood book club. I decided that my oldest son, who was then 14, should read it for ""Mom's Summer Reading Plan"" - also known as the Mom-Forces-Us-To-Read-For-Half-An-Hour-Each-Day-Torture-Program by certain members of the family. I felt it was important for him to learn that not every child gets to grow up in a household that has eight different video game systems. I wanted him to imagine what it would be like if his father came home one night and said ""We have to move right now. You can take ONE THING with you.""Well, he grumbled and he whined. Then he shut up and started to read. He never said too much about the book, though he liked the part where the rat would come to eat out of the mother's big bowl of sugar. And then I saw on his Facebook profile that he had listed The Glass Castle as his favorite book. Huh, how 'bout that?And now, seven years later, my youngest son came home with the book he has to read for English class. Guess what it is? You got it!Ah . . . sweet vindication. Yup, yup, yup!!121!A review on the back of my copy reads:Jeannette Walls has a story to tell, and tells it brilliantly, without an ounce of pity.No pity? Yep. You've got that right. No pity and NO EMOTIONS whatsoever. And certainly no humor.Ms. Walls tells her story like a journalist, which of course, she is, but it didn't work for me that she wasn't sharing her story, but reporting the facts. I felt cheated and unsafe throughout this entire read, as though Ms. Walls was allowed to be robotic and detached, but I was supposed to be delighted by the love she tried to sell as the basis of this memoir. The family that betrays together stays together?Love? Like the love her father expressed as he tried to sell her young body to a stranger? Like the love her mother conveyed by allowing them to live in filth, be homeless, be neglected, hungry, unclothed and so on? These parents were the most loathsome narcissists I've ever had the misfortune to meet.I needed Jeannette Walls to crack me up at the absurdity of it all (David Sedaris style) or BURN THE DAMN HOUSE DOWN TO THE GROUND. Here's the match, Jeannette, take it from my hand.This glass castle, built on garbage, was a garbage read for me, despite placing me in an incredible minority by declaring so. This was a book that celebrated impotence, enabling and neglect and there was no catharsis here, no retribution, either. I was as angry as the Count of Monte Cristo by the end of this read. I demand my revenge!!121!I know many people love this book, remarking on how powerful and moving it was, but I had some deep problems with the narrator's memory process, and some issues about what lessons I was ultimately supposed to learn here. It is a riveting tale, full of unforgettable suffering, strife, and perseverance, about growing up with two bohemian-minded parents, one a raging alcoholic and the other a manic depressive. It is the story of the dangerous synergy that combination produced, and how the narrator and her siblings endured, withstood, and (well, some of them) triumphed. The film, when made, should do well at the box office. However, I am reminded of how a friend once explained Narcissism to me. ""Narcissists,"" he said, ""have to be the biggest Victims in the room and the strongest Heroes in the room--and they demand to be recognized as both at the same time."" My problem is, I found the narrator to be narcissistic, and I stopped believing her version of all the events, especially after I came across a few factual references that totally seemed incorrect based on my own experience and knowledge. These were things someone who lived the experience would have known. (She certainly claims to have a vivid memory of a lot of things that happened when she was three years old, too!) Although doubtful of the veracity, I was compelled by the series of diverse settings, the odd mix of characters, and the ongoing unpredictable calamities to read on and see what happens, if anything, at the end.!121!“Things usually work out in the end.""""What if they don't?""""That just means you haven't come to the end yet.”Jeannette Walls’ The Glass Castle is a compelling memoir. It’s no stretch to say Walls had an unconventional childhood. It’s part adventure, part how do I live through this and make it to the next day. Walls’ matter-of-fact tone makes an account of her childhood effective and keeps it focused on the events which both brought her family together as well as those which tore them apart. She is not a victim in this memoir. She doesn’t ask for sympathy for herself and she doesn’t blame her parents for how she was raised (much). In fact, she finds parts of her parents’ behavior (when not bordering on outright neglect) admirable. Walls easily could have talked about any of several traumatic experiences and how she was scarred by them (and perhaps is still working through issues). If she had gone that route, The Glass Castle would have been a completely different book. Still, by the end of this memoir, the reader marvels at how Walls (as well as her siblings) escaped their parents while still maintaining a relationship with them. An amazing read!!121!Honestly, simply a must read. Wow. Firstly, thank you to my friend Elyse for recommending this book. She knows what I like. Wow this woman. Wow this family. I have just finished reading this books last pages whilst making my lasagne to feed my family, hastily stirring the white sauce and throwing in the bay leaves. The irony isn't lost on me.. I needed to finish this story. But! Mental illness is all around. This family is a perfect example, and also one of resilience. Hey, these children have more successful careers than I do! I always tell my kids that it takes all types to make the world go round. Jeannette Wells has crafted this memoir with passion and strength and devotion, but what blew me away most of all, there was not one shred of self pity packed into this. I know what I'm like in my little world, there is no way I could be this giving, NO WAY! I'm very interested in this amazing lady, I will find her books now and I so look forward to see how she's travelling. I could learn a thing or two, and that's what I'm always looking for. And she can write!!**Addendum: This was an amazing book that my favourite GR friend from the States recommended. I went to the library and got my copy. Months later I came across this book in my (unorganised double layered Ikea shelf thingy) book shelf, that I'd borrowed from my aunt in Queensland. It turns out all of her siblings had read it, making their own notes all over the book. This was a special book, I shouldn't have taken it with me.. But I'm so glad I got to return it. It turns out my aunt had had a similar childhood - I knew she'd struggled, but didn't realise to the extent. This book connection made me love my Aunty Donna even more. We aren't close geographically but I got to see her last month and talked about the book, and that I am grateful for. When 'people' say they've had it hard, have they really?!121!Book Review: The Glass Castle by Jeannette WallsJeannette Walls proves in her astounding memoir that bad parenting and abject poverty do not necessarily condemn children to a dismal future of the same. In ""The Glass Castle"" published in 2005 by Scribner, Walls reveals the intimate details of her upbringing within a dysfunctional yet loving family. ""The Glass Castle"" immediately grips you with an opening scene in which Walls, as an adult in New York City, sees from the window of her taxi her mother scrounging through a dumpster. Her mother is homeless – one of those bag ladies that all of us see – but now you suddenly have to wonder what it would feel like if that was your mother dangling at the fringe of our society. From this shocking moment, Walls transports you back to her earliest memory. She is three years old and suffers a terrible burn to her torso when her dress catches on fire as she is boiling hotdogs on the stove. A long stay at the local hospital near where her family is currently living in Arizona ensues while Walls recovers. To the hospital staff, the negligence of the parents is obvious, but Jeannette does not associate the murmuring disapproval around her with her parents.If any action on the part of social services is planned, we never find out because her father, Rex Walls, plans an early check out from the hospital in his trademark ""Rex Walls' style."" This means that he will grab his little girl and skip out of the hospital bill that he has no intention or means of paying. Jeannette is whisked away with her father, mother, older sister and younger brother and the family hits the road. It begins just one of many journeys in which the Walls family ends up in ramshackle trailers and shacks throughout the deserts of Nevada, Arizona, and California. They stay someplace a while until Rex can't pay the rent or won't and they skip town and do it all over again. Rex inspired the title of the book with the plans, lovingly worked out on paper, for his ""glass castle"" that he aspires to build some day. He often reassures his children with the promise of this fanciful housing. It is to be a solar-powered house, but first he needs to raise the money to build it, which entails numerous gold prospecting schemes that are doomed to failure. Because gold-hunting never pays the bills, Rex also finds work as an electrician or handyman. He is smart and mechanically talented, but his earnings inevitably are washed away in the flash floods of drinking that perpetually leave his family destitute. In an engulfing narrative that sweeps you deeper into an almost unimaginable existence of privation, we see how Jeannette and her siblings cope with their destructively alcoholic father and beg their mother to function and get them food. The mother, in fact, has a teaching degree, but she rarely can drag herself into employability. Although the various rural areas where they live are always desperate for a qualified teacher, the mother cannot abide work and only occasionally holds down a job – with the help of her children who get her out of bed. The infrequent paychecks of the mother rarely go into the rumbling bellies of her children. Rex will invariably claim his wife's paycheck and set about squandering it. This desperate state goes on for years as the Walls children sleep in cardboard boxes instead of beds, endure scalding fights between their parents, and eat anything they can find. Their mother teaches them how to swallow spoiled food by holding their noses. But even amid these horrors of poverty and alcoholism, Jeannette Walls expresses the genuine love within her family. They are loyal to each other, and Rex, in his sober moments, is wise, encouraging, and tender with his children. In her memoir, Walls brilliantly crafts her experiences so that we can see the transformation of awareness that takes place as she grows up. As a little girl, she is uncritical of her parents. She loves them and does not realize how awfully deprived her life is. But as she and her siblings mature, they definitely realize that the shortcomings of their parents are not acceptable. The adolescent years of Jeannette are spent in West Virginia, where her father retreats to his hometown after going completely bust in Arizona. The life of the Walls in West Virginia is appalling as they occupy a shack at ""93 Little Hobart Street."" The roof leaks. The plumbing does not work. The Walls family buries its trash and sewage in little holes it digs. They almost never have any food. Jeannette goes through high school digging leftover sandwiches out of the garbage, and Rex fills the role of town drunk. As miserable want defines their lives, Jeannette's mother does the most infuriating things. When Jeannette and her brother find a diamond ring, they immediately want to sell it for food, but their mother keeps it to ""improve her self esteem."" And so they go on starving.As Jeannette Walls tells the story of her disgraceful upbringing, you will admire her perseverance and that of her siblings. The Walls children eventually take charge of their own lives and support each other into normal adult lives in a beautiful display of closeness among siblings.Every page of ""The Glass Castle"" will shock you with the shameless and selfish actions of parents who are unable and unwilling to even try to take care of their children or themselves. Despite her appalling parents, Walls rarely chastises them with her writing. Her love for her parents often comes through with aching dismay. Much more happens throughout this amazing memoir than has been mentioned here. ""The Glass Castle"" is mesmerizing and an impossible book to put down. It is truly a masterpiece of storytelling and far superior than the typical bestseller.!121!It's no secret that I get to read on the job. I proofread for a financial publisher, which means that I spend my days getting lost in the lilting legalese of prospectuses, trustee meeting results, shareholder reports, highlight sheets – it's riveting stuff, trust me. But we're a small operation with only a few clients and the fiscal schedule is defined by a feast-or-famine work flow: While the numbers are still being tabulated, portfolio managers are polishing their semiannual interviews and style redesigns are being approved before the work descends in avalanches, I’m usually catching up on my reading with on-the-clock me-time.Since it’s almost instinctive to dislike the person whose job it is scrutinize and correct everyone else’s work (especially when said person has one of the few oh-so-coveted offices with a window overlooking the bucolic charm of two parking lots and a heavily traveled roadway), I have spent the better part of my three years there endearing myself to my coworkers to soften the blow when I literally cannot hack through a report because it’s so choked with errors. My efforts have mostly paid off and a number of my mom-aged coworkers have grown rather maternal with me, as it’s also not a secret that I stopped speaking to my parents more than two years ago.When a coworker recently came into my office brandishing an almost-finished book and saying that she kept thinking of me while reading this memoir she couldn’t put down, I assumed she was referring to the way I always have my nose in some kind of reading material at work. And then a little bit of research revealed that “The Glass Castle” was about growing up under the rule of parents who clearly had no business accepting the responsibility of parenthood, which was when I realized that this was my coworker’s way of reaching out to me.A couple of days and maybe about 100 pages (and a lot of wincing because, holy crap, the Walls kids are tiny troopers) later, I got into a car accident during my commute home via a road that sees about seven or eight accidents a day, most of them during rush hour because it is a totally good idea to have a direct route to and from Philly narrow down to two lanes in one of the area’s larger suburban oases. Long story short, I escaped the ordeal with my admittedly low expectations of humanity exceeded by miles. As I watched the tow-truck driver (who was totally cool with my nervous habit of asking a thousand rapid-fire questions as he drove both my car and me to the auto-body shop) load up my beloved, battered car with minimal fanfare, the last sigh of relief I heaved tasted something like “At least I don’t have to explain this to my parents.”The thought resurfaced throughout the evening, like when my husband met me at the mechanic's and I just lost whatever composure I'd been faking when he was right there to help me out of the truck before pulling me into a bear hug. And later when my in-laws, who live right next door and treat me like the daughter they’ve always wanted, greeted me with open arms, said that Mom’s car was all ready for me whenever I was ready to go back to work (as they all but told me that I was going to stay home for a day or two) and reiterated that “A car can be replaced but you can’t” every other sentence and meant it.By the time I was going fetal on my couch and started to feel the damage that a seat belt and steering wheel are capable of (which is surprisingly extensive when you’re a small-statured, large-chested woman who always knew she’d pay for leaning too far forward while driving), still marveling over how I received neither a single verbal evisceration nor a ticket after two of the most emotionally draining hours of my recent existence, I blurted some garbled admission to my husband about not knowing how to stop expecting someone to punish me, which is about when I realized that I’ve spent my adult life bracing myself to be torn down for every misstep as if the fate of the universe relied on me not fucking up, which isn’t entirely unlike the way my parents reacted to the staggering majority of the things that came naturally to me. I called out of work for two days not because my boobs were bleeding (they were) or because it hurt to move my neck (it did) or because pulling open doors made me feel like my chest was on fire (holy crap, did it ever), though my collection of minor injuries eased the terminally itchy conscience that won't even be appeased by having a valid excuse for calling out and leaving other people to pick up my slack unless I accept a load of Catholic-sized guilt in exchange lest I give myself a few justifiable recovery days without the appropriate reciprocal suffering. I needed some time to consider how much an inherently lousy experience opened my eyes to damage I didn’t even know I was still carrying around (what the hell, surely talking about going to therapy is just as good as actually going, right?). My coping method of choice? Alternately napping like a champ and juggling three books, including this memoir of the girl who was born to a bitterly brilliant drunk she idolized and an indifferent, self-involved artist who she tried so hard to understand, only to become the person she was meant to be with little support from the two people who should have been there to cheer her on all the way. Like I’d said, I knew I wasn’t going to be unbiased in how I approached Jeannette Walls’s coming-of-age story: No matter how sympathetically she painted her parents (which she did quite well), I knew I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from resenting them for failing their children. But then the little-girl hero worship Jeanette felt for her tortured, misunderstood genius of her father just struck every raw nerve I have and just poked and poked until I had to physically distance myself from the book. The killer was that I’d stew in whatever calamity last befell these children to the point of needing to know how things were resolved (or avoided entirely). It's distracting to be doing other things and thinking about the book you'd rather be reading. Not even the blatantly narcissistic ravings of Jeannette’s mother sounded enough alarms to keep me from venturing back to this book if I’d stray too far for too long. And I’d’ve thrown the book across the room at Mrs. Walls’s “I’m not crying because you’re leaving me for New York City; I’m crying because you’re going and I’m not!” outburst had I not already been forced to corral all my determination to return this borrowed book in acceptable condition after Mama W -- whose “Oh, I don’t believe in discipline because children need to learn their own lessons” philosophy barely disguised the maternal disinterest and selfish absence that I know all too well – wailed that she has sacrificed so much for her children when the scamps had demonstrated time and again that they’re more responsible for their family than the matriarch is. I, uh, may have transferred a lot of my own lingering anger at my emotionally damaging mother onto Mrs. Walls, which makes me question how justified my screaming dislike of her is. The less said about Papa Walls, the better. My father might not have been a hopeless drunk but I kind of wish he had some kind of excuse for routinely breaking promises to the children who thought the sun rose and set on him. An absent mother is easy to hate while growing up and even easier to pity once you’ve come of age. That simpering animosity is something you get used to after a while and, if you’re like Jeannette and a better person than I am, you simply accept that your self-involved mother has constructed such an elaborate alternate reality around herself that nothing real can get through to her if she doesn’t want it to, that she can even turn homelessness into an enviable adventure. But an idolized father’s fall from grace? The older you get, the harder it is when you finally realize the one person you’ve told yourself can do anything is the person who's let you down with the least remorse. That first hard look at how helpless and broken the man behind the curtain is.... that is not easy to come back from. That’s how little girls grow up to become giant messes.When Jeannette found her way to the school paper and sampled her first taste of print journalism's sweet, sweet escapist nectar.... oh, my heart went out to her younger self in eagerly over-earnest ways. Being a half-consumed whiskey bottle rolling around an otherwise empty desk away from calling herself a true-blooded journalist at such a young age would have won me over if the entire book preceding such a moment hadn't already made me want to see Jeannette find her place in the world. Newsroom nostalgia will always be the easiest way to my too-soft heart.I am amazed that this isn’t one of those “Oh my God, so let me tell you about my super-sad story so you’ll feel just awful about the craptastic childhood I had and then you’ll be totally amazed at how far I’ve come and how functional I am hey, why don’t you love me yet please love me and feel sorry for me I need your sympathy give it to me” memoirs, thank bouncing Baby Jesus. It’s a documentation of these things that happened to the four Walls children and how at least three of them embraced responsible independence and sibling camaraderie. Walls describes what she sees, reporting the facts and supplying exposition as needed like any good journalist. Also like a good journalist, emotions get minimal face time here. Jeannette is the perfect narrator because it seems as though she is the most willing to accept her parents for what they are. Even though I selfishly wanted to know how her adult self dealt with the fallout of her turbulent childhood (because every little adult grows up to be a big child, let's be honest), I found myself admiring how Jeannette was in no way reliant on cheap feelings to maneuver the story to its conclusion. Jeannette and her siblings are the heroes of this story. They get themselves out of a bad situation one by one, fishing out each younger sibling as the means become available. Because what’s a better introduction to a new life of stability after years of only knowing that what comes next is an obstacle you can rely on exactly yourself and your equally young siblings to overcome?Christ, I still have two more reviews to catch up on and a stack of pumpkin pancakes that are clearly not going to eat themselves (unless they plan to fight me for the privilege). In short, this book was fucking great but it struck far too close to home in ways I may have overly personalized. It didn't make me laugh like it did my coworker but it sure as hell did make me appreciate how Jeannette Walls turned out. I've had a lot of people recently and unknowingly demonstrate that humanity might not be as awful as I've always thought it to be, and witnessing a grown child forgive her parents for their many crimes against her certainly made for the kind of book that confirmed it's probably time to fix my perspective. Maybe we're not as fucked of a species as I've feared all along.!121!“We take a chance from time to timeAnd put our necks out on the lineAnd you have broken every promise that we madeAnd I have loved you anyway”
-- “Like a Fool” - Keira Knightley/ Lyrics - John Carney/“Begin Again” Soundtrack Dysfunction and crushing poverty are at the heart of this memoir, but love is there, as well. Readers might find it difficult to accept these things in the casual “this was my life” presentation, as though it had no effect on her, as though she is used to having others feel that one must choose to either love and embrace or cast aside the person who inflicted the craziness upon them. How difficult it must be to share such intimate details with the world and then sit back while they judge not only you based on your life, but also the people that you loved, love, despite themselves, despite the things they did or did not do. Nothing about this memoir seeks pity, or condemnation of those who raised her, or even of the way she was raised, it just is the way it was, and now her life is different. Her rags-to-riches story takes her from Arizona to California to Welch, West Virginia, and eventually to New York City. My father shared some of his stories with me about growing up poor in West Virginia, hours away from Welch, in another part of the state where there are also few economic options. Preacher, professor, farmer, the railroad, or by the time my father was old enough to think of a future, for just a few - a pilot. I would say he never looked back once he left, but the truth is he was friends with many from that small town until the day he died. Having been there, having heard his stories, stories of his friends growing up there, it was easy for me to envision these places she lived, the people. Jeannette Wells has walked deep into her past in this memoir, her younger years were less than wonderful and yet she survived, flourished even, maybe. Certainly there must be scars of a childhood where neglect and hunger are so prevalent, where alcohol is more important than food, where clothing and shoes and shelter take back seat to liquor and chocolate bars. Parents are supposed to be the guardians of those too young to care for themselves, but frequently the children were left to fend for themselves or care for the parents. There are so many moments in this memoir that are horrifying, and she has both the physical and emotional scars from those years. And yet, what really shines through is the compassion and love she still feels after all was said and done.
“We finally find thisThen you're goneBeen chasin' rainbows all alongAnd you have cursed meWhen there's no one left to blameAnd I have loved you just the same”
 -- “Like a Fool” – Keira Knightley / Lyrics by John Carney / “Begin Again” SoundtrackRecommended!121!A million stars!!! I LOVED this book! I wish I had had non stop uninterrupted hours to devour this book but I also didn't want it to end. I loved the family dynamics. What a unique bunch of people! The writing is simple and incredibly accessible so you felt really at home reading along. I actually had times where I felt envious of this nomadic carefree life that it had me rethinking my life of conventional suburban living. Made me think what a sheltered (boring?) life I've led lol. I love a book that takes me out of my comfort zone and gives me a unique and different perspective on life. It's about a family who turn being poor (and boy I mean POOR!) and spin it into an adventure, they stick to their own values and don't care about conventions and fitting in. Although the parents are incredibly flawed many times clearly negligent, you also believed they loved each other immensely. The mum always optimistic and seeing the sunny side of life under the worst conditions was borderline psychotic not to mention criminal but still I loved all her crazy antics. The father always running away so he avoids paying bills and running from bad debts always doing the skedaddle made me laugh out loud many times. This was sad, funny (so funny!!) disturbing and a heck of a fun entertaining book full of whacky and colourful characters that you soon won't forget. I was amazed at the author's positive determination and resilience, she hardly ever had a bad word to say about her family other than to describe the scene. She never allowed her situation to dampen her outlook on life if anything it made her a more compassionate human being. What an admirable lady who deserves every success in life, she really is the definition of a rags to riches story and I loved every moment of this book. One of my favourite memoirs of all time!!121!This isn’t a book I would ever pick up but I’m so happy I did. It’s beautiful and sad and can make you angry all at the same time. Although Jeannette’s parents loved their kids, they had their challenges that always created barriers that didn’t need to be there. It could be frustrating and my heart broke for these kids who could have used a lot more stability and responsibility from their parents who didn’t always put them first. A very unique memoir and unlike anything I have read before!4.5⭐️ rounding up!121!I really don't know how I'm supposed to defend my dislike of this book? I mean, what kind of asshole says, ""Man, this book about a woman's miserable childhood really bummed me out, two stars""? But for real - this book about a woman's miserable childhood really bummed me out. Like, if you read Angela's Ashes and thought it just needed more sexual assault of the pre-pubescent protagonist, then The Glass Castle is for you! There's a bit early on where the dad takes his kids to the zoo and I sure hope you enjoy it, because that's pretty much the only truly happy interaction Jeannette Walls has with her parents for the rest of the book.And it's totally unfair of me to complain about that. Jeannette Walls owes me nothing, and she definitely isn't obligated to gloss over the uglier aspects of her (I cannot emphasize this enough) truly awful childhood just to make readers more comfortable. So honestly, it's not even the fact that this book is XXX-rated Misery Porn that bothers me. What I really don't like about this memoir is that Walls, even as she recounts stories where she and her siblings were being routinely abused by her parents, seems unwilling to look this ugliness fully in the face, and condemn her parents for the way they treated her and her siblings. She ends (no spoilers, relax) on a note of, not quite forgiveness, but acceptance of the fact that her parents were just being true to themselves, and did the best they could. And that's somehow the most depressing thing about the book. The Glass Castle seems to frequently market itself as a story of an unconventional childhood that was tough, sure, but full of love and adventure. (Probably the movie adaptation, which made major changes in order to make the story more heartwarming, is mostly responsible for this) But in reality, The Glass Castle is just the story of an abusive childhood, written by a woman who maybe doesn't realize how truly toxic her parents really are. Anyway. If starving kids, alcoholic fathers, dangerously narcissistic mothers, and sexual assault makes up your preferred memoir cocktail, enjoy.!121!Goodness this is beautifully written! This is easily the best memoir I've ever read, and I absolutely could not put it down.Jeannette Walls shares the story of her childhood, growing up poor in Welch, West Virginia. To give you an idea of how poverty-stricken Welch is, it's the place where America's first food stamps were handed out.Jeannette is the daughter of an incompetent, mentally ill mother and a clueless alcoholic father. But don't worry. It's not what you might think at first glance. This is not your typical cringy, shock-filled memoir. This is a gripping true story of laser-focused perseverance and hope.This is a story about people with major issues (in this case, the parents) doing (I guess) the best they're capable of, even though it's not close to being good enough for their children.This is a beautiful story of strength and survival -- having to raise yourself -- having to save yourself and your siblings. This story is lovingly told, not hate-filled at all, which demonstrates how children can't help but love their parents, even when they're being failed by them.!121!Once I let my frustration with the parents' neglect go, I actually enjoyed this book. Because of her matter-of-fact, non-whining writing, I enjoyed reading this book the entire time and actually put off other things so I could read more. As a disclaimer to my following comments, I am in no way condoning all of their parenting style and I also acknowledge they did not provide for their children like a parent should, but I have to say that I learned quite a bit from her parents! The positive things from this book stuck with me, not the negative ones, so that is what my comments will be about.  The description of her growing up years gave me ideas and motivation of how to be passionate about hobbies and life in general. Her parents taught me how to make learning fun and to see the potential in people and situations (i.e.""this house needs fixing, but it has good bones""). I went away from this book with a desire to have more vigor and creativity in life and to pass that on to my children (i.e. the mom bought tons of shoes from thrift stores and played classical/jazz/country/etc. music and they danced around having a ball while learning all about different genres of music).  I also feel that we've become too much of ""helicopter"" parents -- hovering over our children making sure we direct every thought and action they have. We see this as helping, but I think it is actually detrimental to their own learning and growth. We are seeing the effects of dependent, inexperienced college-aged kids (this was most notable in southern CA). I think many of life's lessons could and should be learned at home, which means a loosening of the reins so that mistakes are still made while we are around to help as parents. Granted, in the book, her parents take this self-learning to an extreme, but I still learned from it. My perception is that (the US) society labels you as a ""bad parent"" if your child is allowed to 1)fall off a slide at the playground, 2)go without their snack one day at school if they forgot it(vs. you bringing it to them), 3) sort out a (non-physical) fight they got in with a friend without a parent getting involved, etc. I also found it amusing that she had such hard time accepting that her mom wanted to be homeless. I can understand how she'd still be embarrased or get tired of having to explain to people, but I agreed with her mom when she said that her daughter had the problem with esteem because she still worried about what other people thought. Anyway, it got me thinking so much about what's most important in life and how important love is (I never once doubted her parents love for her and she gave the impression that she never did either) that I highly recommend it! I had a couple friends that didn't like it, mostly because they couldn't get past things like her digging in trash cans at school because she was so hungry('People like that shouldn't be allowed to have kids' they said). But it was all the other things I learned (naming a star for your birthday) that makes me want to read it again.!121!can’t believe I let this rot on my shelf for SO LONG… too good!121!An extraordinary account of Parental neglect to the point of where I kept asking myself....could All this have possibably happened in one family? I first read this book back in 2009 and didnt even write a review as I found the book depressing and relentless. This time it was nominated for my sit in book club and when the nomination was announced  THE GLASS CASTLE I took a deep breath, gritted my teeth, smiled and thought Ok might just pretend I read again and wing it when it comes to discussion night. But my friend who knew my dislike of the book encouraged me to read it as but this time as a BOOKCLUB READ with the discussion questions in mind and perhaps I may get more from the book second time around.While reading this book I thought about my own family get-togethers and stories that would get told from our childhood days and while I remember very little to the point where I often asked "" are ye sure I belong to the same family""? As I seem to remember so little and this is where I am amazed at how much the author remembers from her childhood.  
Having said that if my childhood was eventful and full of as many odd characters as Jeanettes then perhaps my memory would serve me better.
And while my initial thoughts still remain I did mange to get more from the book, as this time I found the humor and the hope and while I do think perhaps many of the situations are a little embellished for the good of the story there is no doubt the Walls as kids saw some rough times and their parents really were in a league of their own when it came to parenting. How you come through a life like this and come out the otherside a well rounded and capable person really does say alot about this family.  Overall I found this an interesting read and there are funny passages and moments throughout the story which second time around seemed to come through better for me than the first and perhaps this is because second time around I knew these kids were going to make it and I could relax a little.Glad I took the time to read it again and looking forward to the discussion on this one.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook']"
The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing (Hardcover),Marie Kondō,3.87,363552,2010,"Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles?Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house ""spark joy"" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.","There is no rating low enough to compensate for the way this book has ruined my life. Whatever you do, don't read it as it will haunt you. This is a long review but it behooves you to stick with it. To begin, you have to touch each and every possession and ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it doesn't, it needs to be discarded. Do you know how hard it is to summon joy for beige underwear or Neosporin? Yet summon you must. I like my carrot peeler but is joy too strong a word? It gets tougher. Not only must you ""apply hands"" to every piece of clothing while checking for your joy response, you must fold your clothes in very specific ways in order to find each piece's ""sweet spot"". I never knew that ""Every piece of clothing has it's own 'sweet spot' where it feels just right"". This will lead to an historical moment when ""your mind and the piece of clothing connect."" Don't forget to thank your clothes for protecting your body. Thank your accessories for making you beautiful. ""Express your appreciation to every item that supported you during the day.""Never, never ""ball up your socks"" as they can't get their much deserved rest that way. They need to breathe a sigh of relief. You must visit your off season clothes to ""let them know you care and look forward to wearing them when they're next in season. This kind of communication helps your clothes stay vibrant and keeps your relationship with them alive longer.""Everything must be stored standing up rather than laid flat. ""Stacking weakens and exhausts the things that bear the weight of the pile. Just imagine how you would feel if you were forced to carry a heavy load for hours?""You must empty your hand bag every day.""Being packed all the time, even when not in use, must feel something like going to bed with a full stomach."" When you get a new phone, it is kind to text your old one with a message of thanks for its service.Every single thing must be in its assigned place before you go to bed."" Have you ever thought about what it would be like to have no fixed address?"" It is equally important for our possessions to have ""that assurance that there is a place for them to return to.""If we greet our house properly it will "" be happy to tell me what the family no longer needs and where to put the things remaining so that the family can be comfortable and happy in this space."" Not sure if you do this before or after applying hands and checking your joy response. It did come near the end of the book, if that helps.So what do the things that get discarded for not sparking joy feel? ""I think they simply want to leave. Lying forgotten in the closet, they know better than anyone else that they are not bringing you joy."" The people who tidy as this book recommend experience a change in their appearance. ""Their figures are more streamlined, their skin is more radiant, and their eyes shine brighter.""Unfortunately, my eyes are crossed, I've gained 10 pounds, and I feel hives ready to pop. I had no idea when I picked up this pretty little book that it was going to necessitate my search for a live-in psychiatrist. I had NO freaking idea that I was squashing the self-esteem of my possessions. I can NOT find those folding sweet spots and everything in my drawers is in a mosh pit. My hand bag looks sad every time I walk by its nightly fullness. My socks are falling down. I'm not sure why. I hate the word joy now. I'm sleep deprived. My possessions call out to me for help but I don't know if they want me to summon joy or if they want to leave. The other day my husband heard me thanking my underwear for staying up all day. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be married.!121!How do I get into messes like this? Reading books that have words like ""tidying"" in their title, I mean. Well, there's a story behind it.The Good Wife and I are trying to purge, to clean up after decades of marriage, kids, three moves, etc. ""We've got to do something about all this stuff we keep bumping into or dusting,"" I keep saying, ""something more than the penny ante efforts we're doing so far.""Enter a New York Times feature on THIS book, calling it the greatest thing since sliced sushi:http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/gar...""That does it,"" I told my wife. ""We're both reading this on the Kindle.""""You first,"" she said.I should've known right there. It was kind of like the puppy we picked out 10 years ago. ""He's a little mouthy,"" the guy at the shelter said. You'd think an English major would know foreshadowing when he heard it.Anyway, I'm reading this book and reading this book and saying to myself, ""The Times article IS the book. Free, too! Why am I reading all this filler, this clutter, these words in need of TIDYING up?""That said, I should give the book a star back just for the punch line, ""Does it spark joy?"" It's what you say when holding some up-for-tossing item in your hand. ""Does it spark joy?"" If not, heave and ho, my friends.Just now, I looked around the kitchen with my wife at my side. ""Nothing in here sparks joy...,"" I said.""I'm in the kitchen,"" she replied firmly.""No, no. Stuff, I mean.""Anyway, that's the gist of the book. As for her system, Marie Kondo goes into houses (she does this for a living) and starts her ritual by singing its praises. Then she practices the praise of reduction. She's grateful in her own home, too. For instance, she brings her purse home from work, empties it, puts stuff in its place (fear not, it has a place), then thanks her purse for another job well done. In the morning it all goes back in. Says it extends the life of her purse. You tell me -- ""tidying"" or tidying?Marie also says to congregate everything by category in one spot. Start with clothes. Never room by room where clothes may be found, but ALL clothes from the WHOLE house in ONE spot on the floor (if you have a room big enough, and you don't). Now hold each piece of clothing, one by one. ""Does this spark joy?"" Bzzt.(And that's just the clothes... you still have books, papers, mementos, and personal stuff ahead and in that order.)The only other thing I recall is hanging stuff in the closet. Light clothes (color, material) left, darker and heavier right. That's after you've tossed 87.9% of it.Anyway, my wife is getting cute now. ""Done,"" I said. ""Now you.""""Why don't you tell me the highlights instead,"" she said, already spooked by the ""spark-any-joy?"" talk.""Wha-?""Yep. Just like the former puppy that by now has consumed half the house because he's ""a little mouthy."" Should've seen it coming from the get-go -- the minute I got the ""you first"" line. Bottom line: You can't ""tidy"" a house in ruthless Marie Kondo fashion when you're 40% of a pair (the other 60% having a Security Council Veto, among other super powers). But that's marriage... a very untidy thing.!121!""You will never use spare buttons."" WORDS WE ALL NEED TO HEAR.I really thoroughly loved this book. I've always been interested in minimalism - trying to stop material goods being the things that bring us happiness, and not owning more than we need - and picked this book up after hearing a few people around me enjoy it. I was hoping it would give me a few tips on how to lead a more clutter-free existence, and while it accomplished that, it also did so much more. The thing that most stuck me about this book was the immense respect that the author, (who feels like my friend after reading this, a gentle companion through this process), shows to all possessions. She understands that this is an emotional process, and her ideas are not about guilt. She isn't saying ""You're a fool for allowing all of this garbage into your life! Get rid of it all at once!"" Instead she's saying ""All of these things came into your life for a reason, take your time considering them, and then thank them and let them go onto the next stage of existence."" It's all so kind and loving and made me not feel guilty or fear the process.I also really liked the structure of this book. It has a solid introduction, a clear process, a section of tips, and then a conclusion. It's very straightforward and doesn't feel complex or gimmicky. It all feels like common sense. It also had key points in bold which helped in figuring out the main thesis of different sections.The book focuses on tidying your house, but for me (and most of the people reading this) we don't own a house, we own one room. I don't think this matters for two reasons. Firstly, the ideas and methods in this book can be perfectly applied to your space, no matter how extensive it is. It's all about creating the most positive space imaginable, and that is very achievable with just one room. Secondly, this book was very much a philosophy. It's about learning to reflect on the relationship between you and your possessions and is something I will carry with me moving forward in life. Someday I will move out of my parents house and into my own house/apartment and I am extremely grateful that I have read this book and will be able to start that journey with this knowledge.Thank you, Marie, for sharing what you've learned, I'm very excited to start my journey of only surrounding myself with things that I love and bring me joy.!121!Do you like talking to furniture? Do you believe shirts have souls? Are you insane? This might be the book for you.!121!This book did not spark joy. Therefore, I am discarding it.!121!The book is short and sweet, and the author is bat-shit crazy. But. Here are two take-aways that will stay with me:If it does not spark joy, throw it out.And: ""My basic principle for sorting papers is to throw them all away.""Believe me - I have been throwing away (and selling, and donating to Goodwill) with a vengeance for the past few days, and tidying. I refuse to fold my socks though. Folding socks is for people with all the time in the world.!121!""Personally, I recommend hanging sponges outside, such as on the veranda.""Quite possibly the funniest line I have ever read in a book. Because she is dead serious.Although there were several helpful sections about how to declutter and organize your home, much of this book is ridiculously funny. This woman obviously has no children (and no life) as she speaks to all her inanimate objects daily, empties her purse EVERY SINGLE DAY, and doesn't own a dish rack, preferring instead to put all her dishes ""on the veranda"" to dry. She's also afraid of hurting her socks' feelings. I gave it two stars because I do like the idea of getting rid of things that don't bring you joy and I like the idea of stacking things vertically. And I'm taking Marie Kondo's advice and getting rid of this book. It most definitely does not spark joy. Well. . . maybe in an ironic way. :)!121!This book just spoke to me, for whatever reason, although I can see why others might not get much out of it. No matter what the subject is, I love reading books by people that are truly passionate about the subject matter, and one thing is for sure: Marie Kondo is passionate about tidying. Despite all of that, this book isn't really about tidying, at its core. It's about living very intentionally and allowing your surroundings and possessions to become an expression of yourself. If that last sentence made you roll your eyes, skip this book, but if you like the idea of finding meaning in the things that you own, you'll enjoy this.!121!This review was delayed because I was busy tidying up. Yesterday I finished this charming little book about the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing, and this morning I woke up filled with ENTHUSIASM and was ready to open up every drawer and every closet and to simplify, simplify, simplify. Of course, such projects always take longer than you expect. I was trying to follow the spirit of Marie Kondo's guidelines, which involve handling each one of your possessions and asking: Does this spark joy? If it gives you happiness, keep it. Otherwise, get rid of it.Imagine yourself living in a space that contains only things that spark joy. Isn't this the lifestyle you dream of? Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.After spending most of the day doing that, my donation pile had grown to several bags of clothes, a big bag of kitchen items, and a hefty stack of books. The most difficult things to sort were the books (a problem I bet most people reading this can relate to) and fortunately, Marie had some good advice on this:The most common reason for not discarding a book is ""I might read it again."" Take a moment to count the number of favorite books that you have actually read more than once ... In the end, you are going to read very few of your books again ... So when deciding which books to keep, forget about whether you think you'll read it again or whether you've mastered what's inside. Instead, take each book in your hand and decide whether it moves you or not. Keep only those books that will make you happy just to see them on your shelves, the ones that you really love.I have many, many books that make me happy, and I will keep those. But when I looked more closely at my shelves, I do have a fair number of books that I can pass on because they have served their purpose. Which brings me to one of my favorite aspects of Marie's advice, which is that when you get rid of something, you take a moment to appreciate the item and how it served you.Each object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more. When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You'll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.Marie is apparently a very successful and sought-after organizing consultant in Japan, and her book has numerous stories about her clients' efforts to declutter. Marie says many of her clients have a life-changing experience doing this. For example, after getting rid of all the books that didn't spark joy, one of Marie's clients realized that all of the books she kept were about social work, and that what she truly enjoyed in life was helping others, so she changed her career. Marie said this kind of epiphany often ocrrus because once we clear away the clutter in our lives, we can better see what truly matters to us.The anecdotes and guidelines were helpful, and this was a pleasant read, even though the Japanese-to-English translation was a bit stilted at times. I doubt I will take every piece of advice Marie gives —- for example, she recommends putting all of your clothes on the floor, and then sorting them — but I appreciated the spirit of it.Now I have to decide whether or not to keep this book: Does it spark joy?!121!Looking for a new book but don't want to commit?

The Written Review
:  The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.
By no exaggeration, Marie Kondō has spent her entire life tidying.She tidied when she was a child up until her adulthood - and over those decades, she's learned a thing or two about keeping a house clean.
The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.
 And the secret? Joy.That's right. The key to a clean house is joy - what makes us happy and how can we bring that more fully into our lives.She's taken on clients from all over the world and has developed the ""Konmarie Method"" to tidying - starting with the impersonal (clothing) and proceeding into the memorable (keepsakes/heirlooms). She's dealt with a wide variety of clients over the years, and has developed instincts for the best way to clear a house. And (more importantly) how to keep a house clean.
Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.
She wants to make the world a happier, healthier and (above all) a tidier place.Overall - I liked this one!For as long as I could remember, my closet(s) practically overflowed with clothing (from years and years of keeping outfits ""just-in-case"").
But when we really delve into the reasons for why we can’t let something go, there are only two: an attachment to the past or a fear for the future.
After reading her book/watching her Netflix series, I was able to cut out all those extra clothes and really make my wardrobe manageable! One thing I found uniquely associated with her method is the way she integrates joy into her tidying. According to Marie, everything in your house should bring you joy - even the little things. And while that seems impractical when first thinking of it (who ever thought ""joy"" when they look at a potato peeler?), the more I thought about it...the more I realized she was right.Taking the potato peeler example (which I saw a few GR reviewers throwing it around), if you don't feel joy holding it...try getting rid of it.Next time you want to make mashed potatoes...think about how fun it is to use a knife to skin them. How many nicks you get on your hands. The loss of potato because of your awkward peeling.A few rounds of that and gosh darn, you'll become grateful (even joyful) to have a potato peeler in your hands again.And if you don't? Then I guess you never needed it in the first place and now your house has one less useless gadget.Some of her methods seem...questionable...especially to westerners. For example, she recommends thanking each piece of clothing that you get rid of for a job well-done.It seems silly, right? Utterly ridiculous. And yet...it works.At the end of my clothing un-haul, I was left with several shirts that I honestly didn't want...but I also didn't want to give them away. (You know the type. They hang out in the back of your wardrobe for years...and yet no matter how little you wear them...they're always still there).So, I tried the Konmarie method. I held each one in my hand - thinking, Does this bring me joy?If the answer was yes, I kept it. If the answer was no, I thanked the article of clothing for being in my life and for giving me what I needed when I first bought it. And then I let it go.And yes, I felt silly doing it - and I locked the bedroom door so that the hubby didn't know I was doing it - but at the same time, I felt closure. I was accepting that the clothes had no part in my current life and that holding onto them any longer wasn't helping them or me. It was time to set them free.The only thing I disagreed upon was books. Marie believes (strongly) that books go in and out of lives and they aren't really to be kept.
For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small.
Hmmm...does (literally) having a bookshelf in every room of the house (excluding the bathroom) count? (And note: the only reason the bathroom doesn't have its own bookcase is because I worry about the damp)My life is so intertwined with books that I honestly cannot see a time where my novels aren't the focal point of every room.Perhaps rereading the book will give me some perspective...All in all - I loved learning her secrets to a tidy life. My kitchen is wholly organized and I'm going to tackle the basement next. There's something truly wonderful about stepping back from a long tidying session and just admiring how nice the house looks!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!""Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth."" --Mary Schmich. I'm trying, Mary. I really am. Oh, screw it. This was the most stressful book I've ever read. I haven't been thrown into such a fucking frenzy of hatred since The Book Thief, and as with The Book Thief, I'm astounded that audiences en masse are embracing such codswollop. I'm baffled as to why this is a bestseller. My best guess is that Marie Kondo targeted the most materialistic generation in the history of humanity, and they've since passed the book on to their equally superficial, spiritually empty, and stuff-obsessed grandchildren, who have made the fucking thing go viral. At this point, we should just accept the fact that when our fellow countrymen gobble up 4 million copies of a book, it's garbage. Seriously. Stupid just hit a whole new level.But before I go tearing the book and its semi-literate fans to pieces, let's be fair: I'm not the intended audience. Other than the fact that I'm an unduly harsh critic of everything I read (I like to call that using my brain, but whatever), I already live minimally: I live in one of the rainiest cities in the country, but I will never buy an umbrella; except for 4 absolute favorites, all of my books are in the Cloud; knick-knacks make make me want to smack someone, the mismatched mess of an ""eclectic"" decorating style nauseates me, and I never buy anything unless I need it or love it. My house is almost always immaculate, and I don't do clutter. Excess ""stuff"" stresses me out to no end. As I read Kondo's book, I realized that I'm not the typical American drowning in an excess of useless crap. (Living in Europe and trading continents 4 times in your 20s can do that to a person). So why wasn't I nodding in agreement with her guide to decluttering? You mean it's not obvious? Come on, people! Good God. When Americans' capacity for critical thinking has reached the level of blindly adopting all things Marie Kondo/KonMari, we've got bigger problems than ""too much stuff."" Look. There's no such thing as the ""KonMari method for tidying up."" Her ideas should only strike you as new if you've ignored the folding techniques of every retail store you've ever entered, or you've never poked through a Feng Shui catalog. Saying that you follow the ""KonMari method for tidying up"" is like saying you follow the ""Harpo method for finding your spirit"" or the ""Martha Stewart Omnimedia method"" of crafting Christmas ornaments out of pinecones and pipe cleaners.There  is no KonMari method, you idiots. This isn't some ancient Japanese art of decluttering put forth by one diminutive woman from Tokyo. Marie Kondo was manufactured by a Japanese publishing outlet, and KonMari isn't a method, it's a media company. I'm not bothered by the woman-as-the-face-of-a-media-company thing. It's been done before. (Oprah and Martha Stewart, anyone?) What disgusts me about this book is the deception behind it. I don't dig Oprah, but at least she got people talking about uncomfortable topics like sexual assault and racism, among other things. And at least Martha Stewart was candid about her perfectionism and relentless focus on her business functioning as coping mechanisms during an ugly divorce. But Kondo? This chick is packaging her brand of crazy as the path to joy. I mean, peddling your mental illness as the new normal? Damn, that's cold. Look. If you're an American with an abundance of junk, you're normal. You're fine. Marie Kondo wants you to have a problem with your junk so she can make money. Dealing with her issues doesn't make her rich -- selling you her psychosis does.Do you really believe Kondo found joy in decluttering when she says her cleaning obsession started at age 5, and was a ""custom [she] maintained even after entering high school,"" as she ""sat on the floor for hours sorting things""? If you're going to ignore the fact that Kondo chose cleaning over normal after-school activities--a job, calling boys, playing sports--it's easy to brush aside her mention of having a teenage breakdown because her room wasn't clean enough. (Um, that's not a happy kid). Path to joy indeed. But we don't need to psychoanalyze the early years. Kondo admits that her passion for tidying ""was motivated by a desire for recognition from [her] parents,"" and that she ""had an unusually strong attachment to things"" rather than people. (Hi, sad). But is a childless 20-something/former souvenir salesperson, fresh out of an unhappy childhood, really the one you want leading you down the supposed path to joy? Think about what this chick is saying:""The purpose of a letter is fulfilled the moment it is received. By now, the person who wrote it has long forgotten what he or she wrote and even the letter's very existence."" Jesus. That's a bleak outlook on life. But I guess Kondo is right. My grandma doesn't give a shit about the letters she wrote me--she's dead. Then again, I don't hold on to letters from grandma for her sake. ""Aim for perfection."" Jesus CHRIST. The only thing I hate more than knick-knacks and the eclectic is a living space created with ""perfection"" in mind. ""Perfect"" living spaces are stressful. They're goddamned mausoleums void of character and humanity. There's a little genius in a (small) organized mess. A tad bit of clutter is humanizing. There can be beauty in a bit of chaos. Hey, Marie, here's an idea: get outside more. Perfection is a fleeting organic moment: a newborn baby, a sunset, the Fibonacci sequence in the florets of a flower. It's not some state you declutter your way into. ""Move all of your storage units into your closet. This is where I usually put steel racks, bookcases, and cupboards or shelves, which can also be used to store books."" This. Right here. This is exactly why I found this book so goddamned irritating. Passages like this made my immaculate and clutter-free city apartment feel like it wasn't good enough. Take my bookcase. I hate bookcases. I view them as a way of storing junk, and in my 30-something years, I've only seen one bookcase done well. But I have a bookcase for my 6 year-old. (No goddamn way am I going to put his books on the Cloud, giving him another excuse to stare at a screen). I was never bothered by the bookcase until I read Kondo's book, but now I can't wait until we can throw the damn thing away. And moving it out of sight will magically make me hate it less?Yeah, no. This is my son's house, too. Sorry, Marie, I'm not going let your book make me miserable about a kid's bookcase. I'll go back to not noticing it. Thanks. Never, ever tie up your stockings. Never, ever ball up your socks. God! Who the fuck cares about how they fold their socks? I'd love to scribble all over Kondo's walls just to see what she'd do. ""Transform your closet into your own private space, one that gives you the thrill of pleasure.Heh. An organized closet sparking a ""thrill of pleasure""? I'd recommend another human being or a battery-powered...never mind, get your ""thrill of pleasure"" wherever, it's not my business. ""When you stand in front of a closet that has been reorganized...your heart will beat faster and the cells in your body buzz with energy."" Isn't it weird that Kondo describes an organized closet with words generally associated with falling in love/physical intimacy? Well, that's...fucked up, but whatever. I had an altogether different experience. When I upgraded to a new apartment a few months ago, I organized my hall closet. Afterwards, I stood there wondering if I'd accomplished anything or just wasted a bunch of time. When my 6 year-old wandered up and, near tears said, ""When you clean, we don't get to play,"" I went ahead and decided on the latter. This is the routine I follow every day when I return home from work. First, I unlock the door and announce to my house, 'I'm home!' Picking up the pair of shoes I wore yesterday...I say, 'Thank you very much for you hard work,' and put them away...I put my jacket and dress on a hanger, say 'Good job!'...I put [my handbag] on the top shelf of the closet, saying 'You did well. Have a good rest.'""  Um. She's talking to her stuff. What the f%$#?!?!And why are Americans so quick to dismiss Kondo's talking to inanimate objects as some cultural quirk? No one talks to their shit in Japan unless they're certifiably nuts. ""The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one's hand and ask: 'Does this spark joy?'"" LOL, the ""wisdom"" of people under 30. Anyone who has kids (or a general understanding of life) knows this is fucking ridiculous.I mean, give me a break! Going all slash and burn on your life, save for items that ""spark joy?"" I wonder what people who've lost everything in a fire would say about that? I'm sure people who survived major disasters would *totally* enlighten you about the *joy* sparked from their stuff. Obviously, if your mountain of junk makes you miserable, your stuff owns you. But if you Kondo-ize your house until you only have things that ""bring you joy,"" your reduced pile of stuff still owns you.Face it. If you're looking for joy in the material, you don't need Marie Kondo--you need to reevaluate your life. Okay, fine. Maybe I'm being unfair. People are indeed affected by their environment, and decluttering can feel satisfying, even cleansing. But look who's telling you how to go about it: a chick whose childhood obsession with cleaning came from trying to please others, whose sole work experience includes selling junk at shrines, and whose descriptions of ""joy"" include rules, repetition, ritual, and talking to inanimate objects. Yeah. They make medication for that. At this point, I should pick up Marie Kondo's book and ask myself whether it sparks joy. Well, no, it actually sparks rage. To the trash with it, then! SUCKED.!121!I laughed out loud four times reading this book. Otherwise, it's the ravings of a lunatic. Funniest moments include the author bursting into tears when she discovers a smudge of bathroom slime on the bottom of her shampoo bottle and that she believes if you have 80 rolls of toilet paper in your house, you are a hoarder instead of a Coscto member. This is a woman who has her entire bookshelf in her clothes closet; if I walk into your house and you do not have 200 books laying around that you haven't read yet, I simply don't trust you as a human being. Because you are not. Three stars for unintended humor.!121!I so agree that it is life-changing magic when everything has been tidied up. But I don't need to read the book as I already have this magic. Her name is Cynthia and she comes every other Thursday morning. Admittedly she costs a ""bit"" more than this book and wants a computer lesson during her time but she Fabuloso's my floors, the airing cupboard is stacked with neatly-folded linens and once in a while we go at a place (like my son's room) that lacks 'magic' and garbage-bag everything. This is a boring job alone and I can't bear to throw things away. But Cynthia can. She has no emotional attachment to anything and couldn't care less if my son might object to having something or other thrown away. Not that he ever remembers when he comes back from college.I bet you with all the money the sales of this book engenders that the author will no longer be cleaning and tidying up her house herself but also get a magic Cynthia of her own.!121!Because I have such admiration for the Japanese aesthetic, I picked up this book with interest. In fact, I was delighted to discover that my lifetime habits of tidying are roughly in line with Marie Kondo's, the expert's, except for a brilliant bit of advice relative to clothes that I can't wait to try. Kondo's basic mantra is ""keep things that bring you joy; discard everything else,"" and that is so cool that I'm going to try it, because it goes further than what I had thought, but along the same lines. My goal is to have a house as clear and clutter-free as a Japanese tea-ceremony room or house. I've got a ways to go, but lots of joy to discover. If you're a pack rat, read this book now, and get started. If you're already on the tidy brigade, this book will help you up your game. Additional thoughts: there is a third category, beyond ""things that bring you joy,"" and ""things that don't,"" and that is ""things that you gotta have but can't really be expected to bring you joy."" I have a couple of garden hoses, hung on a bracket in my garage. They don't bring me joy; they bring me chores, occasionally. But I would be foolish to get rid of them. I wish Kondo had addressed this third category. Much as I delighted in this book, and appreciate its goals, it seems utopian now after wrestling with the ideas in it for a few weeks.!121!Nimic nu e magic în această carte, doar banalitatea ei înfricoșătoare...Am crezut multă vreme că a-ți face ordine în odaie și a arunca din lucrurile inutile („a duce gunoiul”, cum se spune) este un obicei care nu mai are nevoie de nici o justificare. Nu cred că există cineva care să-l conteste. Și, totuși... Marie Kondo sugerează că aruncarea gunoiului, acest obicei banal, presupune o metafizică abisală, de sorginte japoneză. Trebuie să ne pătrundem de filosofia vidului, de înțelepciunea nimicului...Totul e banal (și facil) în acest mult lăudat volum. Ideea principală („Tot ceea ce posezi sfîrșește prin a te poseda”) a fost exprimată cu milenii în urmă de înțelepții greci. Citez din Epicur (secolele IV-III î. Hr.): „Dacă nu te poți mulțumi cu puțin, nu te poți mulțumi cu nimic”. Japonezii păstrează o mînă de lucruri în casă dintr-un motiv mult mai puțin filosofic decît bănuim. Țara e într-o zonă seismică. Iar „experții” au observat că, la un cutremur de 8 pe Richter, nu mori pentru că-ți cade tavanul în cap, ci pentru că vine șifonierul (de mahon) peste tine și te strivește. Minimalismul japonez (odăi aproape goale, tatami, paravane în loc de uși etc.) e pragmatic. Nu trebuie să fii un gînditor profund ca să înțelegi asta. Și să rămîi în viață...Toate recomandările consemnate în acest volum se adresează celor avuți, colecționarilor de fleacuri. Moda Kondo la ei a prins, ei au ridicat-o în slăvi pe autoare, ei au transformat-o într-o vedetă. Un om sărac nu prea are ce să arunce din casă (cînd are o casă). Și nici ce să lase moștenire. El nu posedă un parc de mașini, o vilă cu 3 bucătării și un morman de blănuri. Pentru sărac „depozitarea șosetelor” (pp.72-73) nu poate fi o problemă încîlcită, de vreme ce are, să zicem, doar 3 perechi. Pe prima o poartă luni și miercuri, pe a doua marți și joi, ultima e pentru zilele de vineri și duminică. Sîmbăta nu iese din casă. Respectă sabatul.Ideea de a păstra cît mai puțin e etern valabilă (cu asta sînt perfect de acord), dar mă îndoiesc că „a-ți face ordine în casă aduce noroc” (p.165). Și cei dezordonați pot cîștiga la Loto...În fine, tot ceea ce spune Kondo despre cărți (pp.77-83) mi se pare profund greșit. E observația unui om care nu are obiceiul de a citi. Marie Kondō ne îndeamnă să renunțăm la cărțile pe care le-am străbătut doar parțial. Sau deloc. „Dacă ai citit numai jumătate dintr-o carte, de fapt, atît merita să parcurgi din ea”. Deci, cartea e de vină pentru lenea noastră de a citi. Kondo nu bănuiește că poți păstra o carte în biblliotecă și 5 ani fără să o consulți. Din fericire, interesele și pasiunile noastre se modifică destul de frecvent și cartea odinioară „inutilă” își găsește brusc locul pe masa ta și îți oferă sugestii la care nu te-ai așteptat...P. S. Îmi scapă cu totul motivul pentru care un astfel de product a ajuns bestseller în Occident. Poate pentru că e pe înțelesul tuturor și nu pretinde nici un efort mintal...!121!I think the word ""tidy"" or ""tidying"" was used in the book at least a 100 times, and that's being conservative. Talk about some clutter...Anyway, I definitely didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would. And I certainly didn't enjoy this as much as The Joy of Less. Maybe it was the fact that I had read that book prior to this or the fact that I have been reading a lot of minimalist blogs and sites that already extrapolated the best parts of this book and the KonMari Method...but I just found myself very underwhelmed here. I can definitely appreciate the message and the process here, but listening to her talk about how she was in tears as a 5 year old when she couldn't figure out the best way to organize her closet had me like... And don't get me started on the suggested anthropomorphism of my underwear drawer...!121!Edit: Apparently thntn is very upset and thinks it’s racist of this white woman not to like this book (I like Kondo as a person just fine) because the author isn’t white. Well, that’s bullshit, obviously. If thntn doesn’t like a book by an author that is of a different race than her’s... I guess that makes thntn a racist herself. It appears that I have to make a correction. I’m told that Ms. Kondo never said to get rid of hangers. I apologize. It must have been the word ‘tidy’ echoing in my brain on a loud enough level that I missed it.Forgive me.Terrible. Ridiculous. Repetitive.If you took the words, tidy, tided, and tidying, out of this book you would be left with a pamphlet. I have this thing called misophonia and I made the crucial error of listening to this book on audio. Repetitive stuff can really get under my skin and there were a few instances when listening to this book that I had to stop myself from throwing my phone out of my moving vehicle. “Say tidy one more time! Do it!” Crunch.This isn’t the type of book I would normally pick up and I think I did because of something a friend mentioned. I’ve been thinking of go through all my stuff and simplifying. So much crap accumulates around a house over the years and it starts to make one feel a little anxious. I thought that maybe this book might have some helpful tips to get it done.Nope.This is the book broken down once all the ‘tidy’ words have been removed.1.	The whole damn house must be done in one go. (Hahahaha)2.	You have to touch each item you own and ask yourself if it brings you joy. (Riiiight)3.	If the item does not bring you joy, thank the item for it’s service (I’m not kidding) and discard it.4.	Don’t ball up your socks or tie your hose together (who does that?) because it hurts their feelings (I’m still not kidding), your supposed to put them together and roll them up like sushi and stand them in shoe boxes. 5.	Fold all your clothing, no hangers of any kind EVER! Because it’s very important to touch everything you own as often as possible….but I have to touch my clothes to hang them, right?6.	Store things vertically. This means, don’t lay your shirts down flat in the drawer, but file them (I guess) like you would files in a file drawer….?.....7.	Women, always choose pretty clothing to wear even while lounging around the house or going bed. (Um, no)Seriously, how much time does this woman have? There was more ridiculousness I’m sure, but I think I blocked it out, or I missed things whilst yelling ‘no no no no’ to block out the ‘tidies’. As a experiment, I started going through my stuff. I didn’t ask the stuff any questions. I worked diligently, though I took breaks here and there, and after two days of sorting, purging, loading up the car and running the stuff to be donated, I got trough….drum roll please….. One. Closet.Don’t bother with this book unless you love the words, tidy, tidied, and tidying and you need a good laugh.!121!I give this one 2 stars because I took a few things from it that I think are great ideas to help me organize. But about a third of the book was spent repeating itself and when it wasn't doing that...it was just weird to me. I wondered at times if the book was satire or a memoir of OCD disguised as the middle child syndrome. Some examples that had me wondering if this was satire or not include:1) She talked as though inanimate objects have feelings or as though they are alive so you have to say goodbye to them and a nice thought before throwing them away. You don't want to hurt their feelings since they no longer bring you joy. She thinks that socks shouldn't be balled up because they deserve to rest comfortably since they are a medium being rubbed between your feet and your shoes. Poor socks.2) When she goes to someone's house to help ""tidy"" (organize) she bows in the middle of the room and greets it and also thanks it for allowing her to tidy it up. Basically she and the room connect at an intimate level before she goes stripping it down to its bareness. Oh, and she wears a dress and blazer when tidying to show respect to the house (not its occupant) and thinks you should too. Sweat pants are a big no-no ladies! And don't forget to clean out your purses on a daily basis. No bloated purses for you.3) She claims that tidying rids the body of toxins and that she sees it quite often. She claims that it clears the skin and trims the waistline. So don't be alarmed if after purging you get a pimple or your belly starts to rumble. She said that after one of her clients tidied up her space she immediately had diarrhea (yes, she went there) as though her body was purging its junk out too.4) Once when she replaced her cell phone, she was sure to send her previous phone a text message thanking it for its service. When she did this, her phone (that always worked properly) died and never worked again. It was like it knew it's job was done.I would have probably taken more from this book if there was less of the above type of examples. Now I just think the book is a bit kooky.!121!Consejos útiles como el de organizar por categorías. Para gente desordenada como yo, es genial. Eso sí, los comentarios machistas son como patadas en mi útero. ""Si eres mujer, ponte algo femenino o elegante para dormir. Lo peor que puedes hacer es usar unas mallas desgastadas."" ""Si las mallas son tu atuendo cotidiano, acabarás por ser como ellas, lo cual no resulta muy atractivo"".

Actualización: después de hacer todo lo que esta señora decía en pocos días (porque ella así lo recomienda) mi piso entró en un efecto rebote brutal. Después de leer un blog, que no sé si conocéis (se llama Orden y Limpieza) entendí todo un poco mejor. La autora del blog se llama Alicia, es una mujer española experta en organización (ordenar casas, ayudar en mudanzas, rutinas...). En una entrada, habló de los fallos que ella ve al método de Marie. Para empezar, hay una diferencia de base cultural. Eso es así. Marie es japonesa, la gran mayoría de sus clientes también lo son, y las diferencias culturales están ahí. La vida mediterránea es muy distinta a la vida japonesa. En otro punto trata el tema de ordenar del tirón vs ordenar poco a poco y comenta el temido efecto rebote, que fue justamente lo que me pasó a mí. Me pegué la panzada a tirar, organizar, en muy poco tiempo y al poco el piso estaba más desordenado que nunca. He cambiado el método, y me he hecho un horario de organización y limpieza para ir desglosándolas en varios días. Así me siento muuuucho mejor, más tranquila y el piso está perfecto. De hecho, es lo que hacía antes.Concluye su post explicando que cada uno debe organizarse en base a su vida. Nuestra casa debe adaptarse a nosotros y no al revés, y lo que a algunos sirve, a otros no. Os dejo el link del blog para que lo visitéis si queréis, tiene muchos tips de organización, incluso para el coche: http://www.ordenylimpiezaencasa.com .Marie me ha ayudado en muchas cosas, sí, pero como bien dice Alicia, estos temas hay que adaptarlas a uno mismo y no frustrarse por no conseguir la perfección.!121!I have just experienced the life-changing magic of discarding two-thirds of my clothes, shoes, and accessories! One category down, a whole house to go. It's so fun to get dressed now; all I have to do is reach in and anything I pull out ""sparks joy"" in my heart. After going up three sizes and then back down again within the last 2 years, you'd think I wouldn't have anything left to discard, but that wasn't true. So many items were hiding the good stuff, dragging me down with bad memories, worn out associations, and/or poor lines and fit.After reading a few chapters, my husband has already begun with his own clothes, and miracle of miracles, he immediately bought some new work pants in his own style, of his own choosing, the kind that ""spark joy"" for him. And this man hates to shop. So, life-changing? Yes! Does the book coincide with everything I've learned in the last 40 years of studying the energetic nature of human beings and all life as we know it? Yes! Do I love this book? Yes! Am I the kind of person who, even though I recently undertook another de-cluttering project, still lived amid stashes of things that weighed me down with guilt and obligation and insecurity? Yes! My husband and I experienced some scary poverty years early in our lives together. It's been difficult ever since to resist the urge to keep more than we need. As the youngest in our respective families, we also shared the habit of accepting whatever was given to us, hand-me-downs that might or might not have suited us. The concept of wearing, using, or keeping only items that ""spark joy"" makes brilliant sense to me now, and feels like wonderful liberation.I am very excited and inspired by Marie Kondo's work, and I'm equally enthusiastic about continuing throughout the house until we are living a much smaller, less encumbered, joyously infused material existence here in our happy home. I love the way she characterizes the impact of our thoughts on our things, and vice versa. I just love her entire outlook. Oh yes, one more life-changing aspect (already): I hated to fold things. Just like she says, after following her instructions (and watching her demonstrate on YouTube) it's become a fun game for me. Weird, but true. You have to experience this to believe it. I recommend reading the entire book before you begin any ""tidying-up,"" though, so you get the full effect of Marie Kondo’s charismatic, inspirational advice.!121!I hesitated to read this book because I thought it might not have much to offer beyond what's written on its back cover: get rid of any belongings that don't ""spark joy."" That is really the essence of Kondo's advice, but she has more to offer in the rest of the book too, and it's surprisingly eccentric and Japanese. No American book would advise praying to your house before tidying it, for example, or suggest that objects just want to help you and that, once released from your possession, they will continue reflecting their helpful energy back to you from wherever they are.It seems that these suggestions make Kondo unusual even in Japan, but her Shinto-influenced outlook is so much like what my mother raised me with that it was exactly what I needed to work through the guilt that keeps me clinging to objects I don't use or even particularly like. Because she spoke my language, I decided to take her suggestions literally, even the odd ones. So I lit some incense, clapped a couple of times, and prayed to my apartment. A breeze blew in through my crappy vertical blinds, and I could imagine my apartment feeling glad for the recognition.!121!I got hooked on watching a show from around ten years ago called Hoarders. As you may imagine from the title, this is about people who are the polar opposite of tidy. If you, dear Goodreader, exploded a bomb inside your house, the resulting vista of destruction would still be 100% more organised than these hoarders. I realised that I myself hoard books. But very neatly. Most of them are in the loft. The first section is fiction, arranged, obviously, by author’s last name. I’ve read all these. I am thinking that Marie Kondo might possibly give me a hard time about that. She could reasonably ask why I need to keep those, since there is no possibility I could ever have the time to reread any of them, and in any case, I rated quite a few of them one or two stars, so why would I ever want to. This is where me and the hoarders are not so far apart. They keep stuff they won’t ever use, they seem to imagine vaguely that they will be able to live another hundred years and be able to get round to all these projects and sort out all these towering piles of broken furniture and rain damaged guitars and patch all those rat-gnawed doileys. In the fiction section those names beginning with Mc give me mild anxiety – should I assume there is an A between the M and the c? If I don’t those authors will find themselves exiled from their clan members whose names begin Mac. So I assume, but trepidaciously. The short story collections come at the end of the fiction section. There is no sensible way of ordering them. Very sorry but no one remembers who edits an anthology so their names are useless. After fiction comes Memoirs, Politics, Theology and History. These have their own idiosyncrasies which I shan’t bore you with. After those comes some great shelves of graphic novels and then science fiction followed by my Shelf of Shame : true crime. I’m sure Ray Bradbury shudders to find himself within arm’s reach of John Wayne Gacy (whereas Kurt Vonnegut smiles sardonically) but I am not running Borges’ Library of Babel here. So that is the loft. Downstairs you will find bookcases dedicated to biographies (arranged alphabetically by subject name not by author name), books about books, and books about music. There are memoirs and biographies in the music book section – I know! What a contradiction! Shouldn’t the music biographies be shelved with all the other biographies? Should Joni Mitchell come between Grace Metalious and Anais Nin? How delicious!. Should Captain Beefheart interpose himself between Samuel Beckett and Saul Bellow? Perish the thought. So after much head scratching I assigned the musicians to their own ghetto. Then finally I have some shelves dedicated to those most intimidating books of all – the To Be Reads. They glower at me every day. I know what they are thinking – why haven’t you read me yet? Eight years I have been patiently waiting! Am I no longer pretty enough? Some of the older ones watch newer arrivals plucked off the tbr shelf almost immediately – I can hear their pages gnashing. I’m almost sure Marie Kondo would tell me point blank to get rid of half of these books. So I’ll put my copy of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up carefully on my tbr shelf and benignly ignore it for a few years.!121!I know a secret. If you have too much stuff and it’s bugging you then get rid of it. All of it. Well, nearly all of it. Save a few things but only the things you absolutely love, the things that spark joy within your being (you’ll know it when you feel it, says the author) and don’t bring more things into the house unless you love and/or need them. Don’t think you can do that? Well, never mind then.This author wants you to be absolutely ruthless with your possessions and do it in one fell swoop. Don’t dilly-dally and put certain unpleasant things off. Absolutely do not waste money buying “storage solutions”. Just get rid of your stuff and you won’t have to store it or dust it or leave it there to feel bad for itself. Now, none of this is a bad thing (though the last might be a wee bit kooky) and honestly I’m all for it. I had way too much crap lying about and it was driving me crazy. Broken crap, ugly crap, gifted crap, crap that had been there so long it was invisible to me. But this book has a problem and it is a BIG one that I’m betting many of you here on this site may take issue with as well. 

Step #2, you see, is books. BOOKS! Step freaking two is BOOKS. As you can probably easily imagine, I am stuck here on step #2 because, well, it’s a call to action to rid myself of my precious books! I’ve been collecting books since I was twelve years old. I have a lot of books but I’m afraid I may love them all. #1 was clothes, shoes, accessories and that was a breeze. Who needs clothes taking up space that could hold a few books? This was easy, thought I. My closet was done in an hour or so. Everything culled, sorted and color coded and folded all nice and tidy-like. I could blow through this, thought I. A zen and clutter-free life was within my grasp. I had this. Then step #2 happened and I was instructed to rid myself of all of the books I have loved before (but may not love again) and all of the books I have not read yet. Uh oh. I was told to remove my TBR pile(s) from my life. Forever. And almost always. She’ll allow you to re-buy digitally if you are pining away and dying of sadness for it. I was instructed to touch each one and see if it sparked that apparently not-so-elusive feeling of joy within me. Trouble is they all kind of did. I suppose I am broken. I tried folks, I truly did. I took pictures and even posted them online in an attempt to humiliate myself into following through. I even went so far as removing a gigantor bookshelf, stocked three piles deep, floor-to-ceiling, from my room as well as an armoire I no longer needed. I have to admit my room looks and feels calms and free and spacious. The bookshelf now neatly resides in my basement. I pulled off all of the books and starting sorting them but it made me incredibly sad to think about tossing them out of my house where they might potentially end up in a trash/recycle bin (according to the author everything has feelings so how could I allow this? Better they be a little lonesome on my shelf than DEAD, right?!). Instead of tossing them into bags, I started arranging them by color (which she wants you to do with clothes) and then I put all but a dozen or so back up on the shelves. They look happy and pretty and they brighten the back wall of the basement. I have decided that I am keeping them. They are my one and only vice and I work hard. They are not clutter.I think I shall pretend that step 2 was nothing but a fever dream.After I was revived with sniffing salts I got back to business. So next comes all of the other stuff which I can easily part ways with; the paper, the stuff no one ever eats, the gadgets (my days of bread baking are over), the broken things that we’ve been thinking we’ll fix someday, the mementos, pictures and all the other useless crapola that has been residing in the basement since we moved in a million years ago. I’ve removed countless bags of trash and several car loads of “stuff” and hauled them to Goodwill and I miss none of it. It is so much easier to clean my house now. I haven’t followed this plan as written, it’s difficult when you live with several other people, so we still have some bins and crud to get to but now I'm inspired to keep at it.This book will give you some unique tools and I do recommend it if you skip step two or perhaps save it for last, if you’re anything like me. She has a nifty way of folding clothes that helped me fit everything into a few drawers and will keep me in check if I decide I need more yoga pants. You really do see just how much of each clothing category you own when you pile them all on the bed/floor and separate them into their own little categories. She doesn’t declutter by room but by category. This stops you from getting stuck (on pictures or mementos which are left for the end) and forces you to deal with an entire category and actually finish the job so you never have to do it again. She also tells you to start with a clear vision of your end result. That bit of advice has helped me tremendously.The author clearly has an obsession with tidying. She does not deny this. Apparently, she’s been this way since she was a wee, strange child and goes into great detail at the beginning of book about her childhood hobby of “tidying”. This makes the start a bit of a slog. I found some of her beliefs a little quirky and I will not be emptying my bag out each night so my stuff can “breathe” only to put everything back in come morning (what the?!) but if you can overlook some of the odd things she says, you’ll more than likely find something here to help you out.!121!What will I take away from this ""life changing"" book on tidying up? 1. If you name a method after yourself, you conjure up instant credibility as an ""expert"". 2. If you are a neurotic nutcase with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, try to turn it into a virtue, or even better, a lucrative career.3. If you use the words ""spark joy"", ""feel happiness"" and ""reduce anxiety"" enough times, people will want to follow your lead and pay you good money for your advice. and on a practical level I've learnt that 1. you can apply origami skills to any item of clothing (it may take years to master the art of folding your stockings, but apparently it will save you lots of time in the long run) 2. you ought to store everything vertically, whether that's knickers, pencils or a waffle iron (but only if that waffle iron *sparks joy* in you, obviously). 3. the ideal situation is to live in a bare, sterile home, and should anyone dare to give you an ornament or any other tangible gift, discard it at the earliest opportunity by saying ""thank you, object X, for teaching me that I'm better off without you"". 4. ""reading clouds your judgment"". and for future reference: You thought there was no space in Switzerland? Well, don't ever think about moving to Japan, unless you are ready to throw out everything you have, and that probably includes your children. Yeah, you guessed it, this Marie Kondo won't be coming to my house in her frilly dresses any time soon to have that dialogue with my house, clothes and handbags about how hard they work for me. No thanks. I rather continue to live happily with all my clutter and mess. ---------------------------------------------------- After posting my review I checked out what other people had to say about the KonMari craze, and the first review I read is so brilliant and hit the nail on the head, so here is the link: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...!121!Notes as i read:Things I like:-the idea of tidying by category-the joy factor -""we should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.""-she's not very judgemental -the sweet Japanese anthropomorphizing of objects-her approach to clothes and thanking the objects for their service -her order and suggestion that tidying needs to be done just once in a big swoop and in a certain order: discard first, figure out where things go after-like the idea of seeing what you need/don't need as an act of vulnerability and strength growing Things that don't jive:-She has no concept of the archive-one problem i have with the method is that there are things i have to own that don't bring me joy...i can't get rid of my interview clothes. do they bring me joy? no. Do i need them for when i am seeking a new job? yes.- The book is also very gendered, i feel. Not in a totally offensive way, but in a noticeable way. -hahahaha like I'm going to get rid of books hahahaha (skimmed this section)-hahahaha like I'm going to get rid of paper hahahaha (skimmed this section)-she's not an artist. I can't really apply her theory to my art supplies. I mean, i can to a point, but hello...i have millions of pieces of metal type. The studio is off limits to her. sorry. -class. This assumes you have the money to replace what is broken but still usable or not hold onto outgrown kids clothes that could be used for the next kid.-finding the last section of the book tedious and a bit eye roll-yThe book was probably written when the author was 25...or younger. I'm not going to take her method to gospel but i do think that I will give it a go, esp. in terms of clothing. It's mostly charming, though there are things I'm just not willing to let go of and that's ok too. It's my choice!121!I've read a lot of organization books over the years, but this is a book that might actually change your relationship with your possessions. Instead of focusing on categories, fiddly buckets, or accessories from Bed Bath and Beyond, Marie Kondo asks us to reevaluate the way we relate to our homes and belongings. The question, ""does this spark joy?"" seems pat, but it truly liberates you to think critically why you keep something around. By the end of the book, you'll understand that we keep things that don't enhance our current lives because we are not fully living in the present - that we cannot let go of the past, or are not yet ready to make room for something new in our future. A transformative look at consumerism and its discontents in the 21st century, with extremely helpful tips to help you make deliberate decisions about what to keep, and what to thank and let go of.!121!This book has actually changed my life. I'm now in the middle of category 4 out of 5 of her decluttering/tidying process and honestly y'all i have never felt so good. Thanks KonMari!!121!The Office Kat brought this book to my attention, and it became my plane read for a trip to Australia in November 2014. Doubtless the Kat had an ulterior motive (the office is a stacked up mess) but this book offers more than tips on tidying.The author, Marie Kondo, has made tidying up her life since she was a small child, and shares many anecdotes about her early days as a stealth clutter-control operative in her family home, as well as some of the false starts she had on her way to her tidying method. I will not steal her thunder by revealing her unorthodox methods, but will say it has already worked a magic on one kitchen that I used to dread entering. If one has the will, the method works, and she is also right that I have no desire to go back to my old ways in that kitchen. I think I will apply this method to my clothing and office.Books and papers? well, I may need to build up to that!!121!I picked up this book because so many people talk about it, but I'm not necessarily a hoarder or someone who has too many things that I need to tidy up. This was only four hours long on audiobook so I flew through it in two sittings (while cleaning my room, coincidentally). And although I don't agree with Marie a ton about thinning down on your things (ie. for sentimental items, she's like ""throw them away!! it had value to you once and now it's gone!!"" like, no. im keeping everything i've touched until i die lol), I do think a lot of her advice is helpful. Some testimonies about weight loss and having people's life turn around after tidying seemed a liiiittle far fetched, but still, if this method helped some people get in a good headspace, I'm not discounting that.The thing I didn't expect from this book and I think is really valuable is the discussion about appreciating your things. This isn't a book about tidying so much as a book about only keeping the things that matter to you. America is such a materialistic society and this book is a good reminder to be nice to the things you own and to find value in everything, otherwise it isn't worth keeping. I don't think i'll be saying to my clothes, ""thank you for keeping me warm"" like Marie does, but it was a nice nudge to recognize that owning a lot of things is a privilege, and you can pass on any stuff that has already fulfilled its purpose in your life.!121!The book started out in a fairly logical and reasonable manner but quickly descends into quirky rules and instructions. I believe there are useful ideas to be gleaned from Marie Kondo’s methods and it is sort of a fun read to see what kooky thing she’ll suggest next. Read it and take what you can from it.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Japan', 'Productivity']"
On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (Mass Market Paperback),Stephen King,4.34,285887,2000,"""Long live the King"" hailed Entertainment Weekly upon the publication of Stephen King's On Writing. Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported near-fatal accident in 1999 -- and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it -- fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.(back cover)","”Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. It’s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy okay? Getting happy.”I can’t tell you how many people I’ve talked to over my lifetime who wanted to write a book. Most didn’t know what they wanted to write about, but some of them wanted to write their autobiography because their life had been so thrilling. I think my life has been reasonably boring, and it usually turns out that my life has been ten times more exciting than theirs. When situations like this happen to me, it is usually mildly amusing, but it can quickly turn to sneering when the person reveals to me that they don’t have time to read or don’t really like to read. Don’t talk to me about writing a book if you don’t read. Don’t talk to me about NOT having time to read. What does Stephen King have to say about this?”If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around those two things….”Now, why would someone not want to read? Maybe it depends on when they were born. ”But TV came relatively late to the King household, and I’m glad. I am, when you stop to think of it, a member of a fairly select group: the final handful of American novelists who learned to read and write before they learned to eat a daily helping of video bullshit.”Now someone needs to wrap me in cellophane and stand me up in a museum because I’m probably one of the youngest members of that elite group. I grew up on a farm in the middle of bumfrilling Kansas, where a twenty foot antenna could only pull in three TV channels and one of those channels rolled most of the time. TV had no real impact on my life until I left home at the age of 18 and moved to Phoenix. Thank Zeus!!Now I have young, wannabe writers writing me from all over the world, sending me links to “hilarious” YouTube videos, or they talk to me about binging all weekend on a Netflix show. They are completely enamored with spoon fed entertainment, and what they find funny is to me like paddling around in the kiddy pool of humor in the book world. I wonder why I’m so grumpy.”A novel like  The Grapes of Wrath may fill a new writer with feelings of despair and good old-fashioned jealousy---’I’ll never be able to write anything that good, not if I live to be a thousand’---but such feelings can also serve as a spur, goading the writer to work harder and aim higher.”I can’t tell you how many times I’ve felt that way. Whenever I read a wonderful book like The Great Gatsby or meet a character like Atticus Finch, I fall on my bed and stare at the ceiling and think why am I harboring any thoughts that I can write a novel? My problem, of course, is that I don’t want to just write a novel. I want to write a fantastic novel. I don’t want to just entertain people; I want them to feel the socks ripped off their feet and have them floating around in the air around their head when they read my novel. Stephen King will go into a time when he was struggling with alcohol and using drugs, or should I say abusing drugs. He will tell you all about the accident that nearly ended his life, which happened while he was writing this book. He will talk about trials and tribulations. He will recommend books. There is a whole list of modern books in the back of this book that impressed the hell out of him and impacted his writing. The point is, of course, that even though he is probably the most famous writer on the planet, he is still learning, still enjoying reading, and still writing every day. I take a book everywhere I go. I take a book with me to work every day and read a page or two while my computer is booting up. I have a book with me all the time because I never know when I will be sitting in road work or waiting on a doctor or gleefully reading, in the glow of my flashlight beam on the pages of my book, waiting for the power to come back on at work. I live to read. I live to write. I fornicate somewhere in the middle. This has been one of the most inspiring books about writing I’ve ever read. King talked about examples of the work ethics of writers, but the one that resonated with me the most was Anthony Trollope. He used to write, EXACTLY, for two and half hours every day before going to the post office. If his writing time was up, he would stop in the middle of a sentence and head to work. If he finished a novel fifteen minutes before his time was up, he wrote THE END and started immediately into his next novel. It brought tears to my eyes because that is what it means to be a writer...dedication to the craft. If you want to get rich, go be a frilling stock broker. If you want to write, then turn the squawk box off and search for those buried fossils in the words swimming around in your head. King calls good ideas fossils. For me writing is more like when Michelangelo used to lay his head on a block of marble and listened to the voices in the stone that wanted to be freed. All you have to do is chisel those characters free, and give them life.  If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at: https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten!121!Let's be honest: Stephen King is not one of the greatest writers of all time. He will never win a Pulitzer or a Nobel (he might win a Newberry though, if he ever decides to tap into the Kids/Young Adult market), and on the few times his books are featured in the New York Times Book Review, the reviewer will treat the book with a sort of haughty disdain, knowing their time could be better spent trashing Joyce Carol Oates. None of this should suggest, however, that King is not qualified to write a book about how to write. Sure, he churns out pulpy horror stories that are proudly displayed in airport bookstores, but the man knows how to write a good story, and he's probably one of the most well-known, non-dead American authors in the world. So he must be doing something right. I'm not the biggest fan of King's books, but I really enjoyed On Writing. He talks about writing frankly and practically, mixing tried-and-true pieces of advice (fear the adverb, never write ""replied/remarked/muttered/yelled etc"" when you can write ""said"", and don't be afraid to kill off your favorite character) with anecdotes about how some of his books came about. I especially liked the story behind Carrie: King was working as a janitor at a high school, and one night he was cleaning the girls' locker room. He asked the other janitor what that little metal dispenser box on the wall was, and the other man replied that it was for ""pussy pluggers."" At the same time, King had been reading about how psychic abilities often manifest in girls just beginning to go through puberty. He combined the two ideas and wrote out a couple pages that would turn into the opening of Carrie. (if you haven't read it you should.) Many thanks to King's wife, who rescued the pages from the wastebasket after King first decided that the idea was stupid and threw them away. So, in conclusion: even if you aren't a fan of Stephen King's work, he has some very good advice about writing and storytelling, plus some good stories of his own. Sure, you can call him a sellout. But I like him. Also, he once said in an interview that Stephenie Meyer ""can't write worth a darn."" You stay classy, Mr. King.!121!(A) 87% | ExtraordinaryNotes: The first novel-length book I'd ever finished over the span of one day. Done over two sittings, with a nap in between.!121!There's this magic thing that happens sometimes: I can't wait to reread a book I haven't even finished yet. It's a rare feeling, but one that happens whenever I'm in the midst of a new favourite book. I'm reading these amazing scenes, freaking out over fantastic passages, and already looking forward to the second time I'll read them, when they'll be even clearer and start to feel familiar.It's a rare occurrence, it only happens a few times a year, but it happened with On Writing. The moment it started I knew I would be flipping through it for the rest of my life. It's that moment where you find a new favourite book.If you care about writing at all, if you want to be a writer or are fascinated by the world of writing, I absolutely recommend this gem.!121!On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft - Superb, absolutely superb. I've listened to Stephen King read his audio book three times. I can't recommend highly enough. Since I'm on the cusp of posting 1,000 reviews here on Goodreads, I'd like to share my own thoughts on writing book reviews and link my reflections with Stephen King's wisdom on the craft of writing. “You cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you.”I recall back when I was in my 20s and 30s, reading book reviews in the New York Times and Philadelphia Inquirer and thinking, oh, if I only had the opportunity to write book reviews. I so much love book reviews! I was truly swept away by well-crafted book reviews.Of course, with Amazon and now Goodreads, all that has changed. Eight years ago I seized the opportunity to write online book reviews. I instantly fell in love with writing book reviews and made the commitment back then to post two book reviews a week. Anyway, I honed the craft of writing book reviews by writing and multiple rewrites until I took great joy in reading my own reviews. This to say, Stephen King is so right here - work away until your writing gives YOU joy to read. That way, your writing stands a better chance of giving pleasure to others. “I'm a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, most fiction. I don't read in order to study the craft; I read because I like to read”The key here is LOVE reading books. Like Stephen, I'm a slow reader but as a dedicated book reviewer I read lots of books every year. And like Stephen, I enjoy listening to audio books. Fortunately, I have two abilities that help greatly as a book reviewer: 1) I can easily become absorbed in a book, especially a novel, really absorbed, as if I'm living heart and mind in the unfolding story, and 2) both my short-term and long-term memory are excellent for fiction. I can remember the details of the novels I've read 50 years ago as if I read them yesterday, an ability that comes in mighty handy when writing reviews. “If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There's no way around these two things that I'm aware of, no shortcut.” So true, Stephen! I so much look forward to writing when I wake up in the morning (understatement). And I've built up my endurance to the point where I have no problem writing 2 or 3 or 4 or even 5 or 6 hours at a time. For me, it's not a job grinding it out but rather a continual joy. I echo the great Argentinian author Fernando Sorrentino who said he would never let writing become a job. Worth repeating: never let your writing sink to the level of becoming a job. “To write is human, to edit is divine.” Spot-on, sir! The key is to take delight in revisiting your writing again and again, reading it aloud to make sure the rhythms are smooth not clunky (the ear has it all over the eye when it comes to judging rhythm). When I first began writing book reviews, here's what I did: I wrote out great book reviews written by such authors as John Updike, Michiko Kakutani and James Wood, wrote them out word for word just to get the feel for what it's like to write a great review. I also used a digital device to record their reviews and I listened while taking my walks. After a few months, I recorded my own book reviews, alternating with the great writers' reviews until I was satisfied with my writing - my rhythm, vocabulary, use of examples and metaphor. “Your job isn't to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.” For a book reviewer, this means to be keenly aware of the book you are reading. Underline passages as you read, take notes, read some of the book aloud to get a deeper feel for the author's voice, reread pages or chapters or sections you feel are particularly important so as not to miss the subtleties of character, the nuances of atmosphere along with the author's overall vision. “If you intend to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society are numbered.”If others think you a bookworm or egghead or oddball or goofball (I've frequently been judged all of these), that's their issue not yours. If possible, avoid people who discourage you from reading and/or writing. Cultivate solitude, become your own best friend, make books your friends, make authors your friends, let the creative act of reading and writing become a shining polestar in your life.“The scariest moment is always just before you start.” I think Stephen is thinking of those who want to write a short story or, most particularly, those who set out or are in the process of writing a novel. For me, there are no scary moments in the process of writing book reviews - not at the start, not at the end nor anything in between. So saying, I'll post this review.!121!I know it's like saying ""puppies are cute,"" but it bears repeating: everyone who wants to write, whether for a living or not, simply must read this book.On Writing did more for me as a writer than anything, and any success I've found as a storyteller can be traced to my reading it.!121!Un libro imprescincible para cualquier escritor.No soy muy fan de libros tipo 'autoayuda', porque siento que su tono es condescendiente. No soy fan, en general, de gente que se cree por encima de ti y decide prestar su valioso tiempo en enseñarte lo que sabe, pero dejándote claro que su éxito es inalcanzable. Tenía miedo de que Mientras escribo fuera a ser así, y no lo ha sido para nada.Stephen King es uno de los autores más prolíficos y mejor valorados de la era contemporánea. La gente le encasilla en el terror, pero ha escrito desde thrillers a novelas policíacas, ciencia ficción y fantasía. Es, como unos amigos míos decían hace muchos años, el Maestro del Ser Humano. Tiene un don para los diálogos, para conectar con el lector, para crear personajes y sobre todo, para hacerte sentir algo, sea bueno o malo.En Mientras escribo vamos a encontrarnos un libro diferente a todo lo que hayas leído. No es una guía, ni un libro de estilo, ni una biografía, ni un libro inspiracional. Es todo eso junto, mezclado, y el batiburrillo hace que sea increíble. Pero vaya, ¿qué podíamos esperar del señor King? Tampoco es un libro para todo el mundo, como él mismo dice claramente en varias ocasiones. Es un libro para escritores: para aquellos que ya hayan escrito, o los que quieran empezar, o los que sientan que no lo necesitas. Es un libro para cualquier persona que sienta fluir el poder de las palabras en sus venas.El estilo de King es, como siempre, directo. No escatima en palabrotas o en decirte las cosas a la cara. Si siente que un autor o un concepto es una chorrada o una estupidez, te lo va a decir. Y te va a explicar por qué. Y, lo mejor de todo, es que al final le vas a terminar dando la razón. En concreto, respecto a los capítulos donde habla de las 'herramientas' de escribir, vas a quedarte a cuadros con sus explicaciones. Además, una de las cosas que me gusta es que no es solo su experiencia, sino que analiza los textos de otras personas, pone ejemplos e incluso cita libros de teoría del lenguaje para que veas que no está loco.Sin duda alguna el principio puede resultar confuso. ¿Por qué Stephen King me está contando su infancia? ¿Qué me importa que haya tenido problemas en el oído o que casi muera en un accidente? Pues, querides amigues, sin esa parte este libro no tendría sentido. No solo te deja ver que ser escritor es casi de nacimiento, que desde niño sintió la necesidad de absorber historias y de también crearlas, sino cómo la escritura le salvó y cómo ser escritor no es un camino de rosas. Su historia de vida es de estas que podrías escuchar durante horas, no solo por interesante, sino por significativa.
He aprendido muchísimo con este libro.
 Había cosas que ya conocía de él (como que es muy propenso a ser simple, directo, en sus libros, porque cree que hay cosas más importantes que hacer que poner adverbios o palabras rimbombantes), pero no conocía su justificación al completo. Gracias a este libro tan extraño he aprendido a apreciar cosas que jamás me había parado a pensar, pero sobre todo me ha dado ideas y un chute de energía brutal. Era el libro que necesitaba en este momento.Mientras escribo es un libro inteligente que, sin pausa, y mezclando churros con meninas consigue enseñarte y mejorarte como escritor sin que te des cuenta. Eso sí: es un libro que dice las cosas como son. Al fin y al cabo, es Stephen King. (Y si sois fans de él, cuenta secretos muy interesantes sobre algunas de sus novelas más famosas, así como su forma de trabajar. Concretamente habla bastante de Carrie, Misery, El resplandor, El misterio de Salem's Lot y algunos de sus relatos más famosos en el momento de escritura del libro.)!121!So it's become very clear to me now that very few writers actually write about the craft. The only Latin American writer to do so? Mario Vargas Llosa (who took several years off of his busy novel-writing to write about his now-ex-pal Gabriel Garcia Marquez). But I suddenly forgot who the King was (no, I mean literally: I've not read him in years! High school being the prime time for Stephen King, & all): the guy has useful insight, no shit, because he is not only prolific & uber-successful (he got $400,000 for his first novel “Carrie”!), but because, let’s all admit it, he’s pretty damn good. Maybe prose is not the forte per se, but story sure is (think of how many times he has tapped the vein of the zeitgeist to produce visceral, emblematic and modern monsters). It's interesting to compare this with the only other non-fiction I’ve read of late, “The Perpetual Orgy” & “Letters to a Young Novelist” by the already mentioned Peruvian auteur. They both (Vargas Llosa and King) tell us to seriously commit to writing, to write, write, write, write, WRITE, but, even more splendidly, they endorse heavy reading (duh!). I love Stephen King quotes, like this little morsel of truth: “If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time or the tools to write.” Take that, non-reading punks verging-perilously-close-to-ignoramuses! !Let me recall some of the stuff I’ve learned (the rest has been absorbed as if by osmosis): 1) rewrite at least two times once the novel has been completed, 2) write & read for at least 5 hours every single day, 3) IMPORTANT: look for an editor (they are eager for new talent, King says), 4) VERY IMPORTANT: begin a serious submitting process (L. Williford has always emphasized the importance of this!), 5) write solely to your IR (Ideal Reader)… it's all super helpful. Perhaps the “Toolbox” section is its weakest part (inversely, MVL’s bag of tricks is on glorious display in “Letters” [though he never mentions the publishing process like King does])… going over rudimentary English is, I am forced to admit, quite lame. But King does seem enthusiastic throughout as only the best teachers are in the classroom—his tone is one of (slight) optimism for the developing novelist. He cheers you on (THE Stephen King!) !!! Bottom line: INVALUABLE stuff, a few (awesome for the fans) confessional tidbits, & some golly-good pointers.!121!I read this shortly after finishing NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) this year, actually it would be more accurate to say I devoured it. This is full of great writing advice, and I'll need to get a copy and read it 1-2 times a year. Most helpful? The section on grammar! Seriously, I never really learned grammar.""Gould said something else that was interesting on the day I turned in my first two pieces: write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right - as right as you can, anyway - it belongs to anyone who wants to read it.""""...The writer's original perception of a character or characters may be erroneous as the reader's. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it's hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don't feel like it, and sometimes you're doing good work when it feels like all you're managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.""""You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despair - the sense that you can never completely put on the page what's in your mind and heart.

You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world.

This is especially so if you’re a writer trying to hone your craft in this beautiful world of writing and learn a thing or two from one of the best authors to ever do it.Now, before I begin my review, here are some of the trigger warnings I found while reading this novel…- Alcoholism- Drugs- Suicide- Bullying- Traffic collision with a pedestrianIf any of these trigger you, please do not read this novel. Moving along, here’s a little backstory on me and why this novel spoke to me in ways I’ve never experienced before. You see, besides loving to write these book reviews, I’m also a professional sports writer and editor. I’ve been writing for over 25 years now on everything from wrestling, football, baseball, and other various sports.I truly wish I read this novel back in 2000 when it was first published since this would have been immensely helpful for that young aspiring writer in me. Yeah, I read a lot of self-help, how-to, grammar, and general writing books to hopefully “make it” in the world of sports writing. They all helped me but who knows, perhaps if I read “On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft” back then, I might have achieved my dreams a lot sooner in my life than later on. That’s how resourceful this novel is in the grand scheme of things.One thing about me is that throughout the various stages of my writing career, I knew I wasn’t the best writer but make no mistake about it, I worked harder than anyone around me. I wrote as many high-quality articles as I could, hitting over 100+ a month to keep getting my name out there. I kept learning, growing, and adapting over time and I’m very proud to say that yes, I made it and have made my dreams come true. I work in sports media in a managerial Editorial Director role and it’s one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me in my life. It wasn’t easy to earn this role but I made it and reading “On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft” proved that every single thing King advises in this novel on the craft of writing is 100 percent true.Work hard, be humble, read more than you write, and never forget where you came from. My goodness, this was such a powerful read. I loved how raw and real King was about the craft of writing where he spoke the unfiltered truth about what it takes to be a great writer. Reading this felt as if I was sitting with him in a nice cafe in Maine where he talked to me about his life, shared some great stories, and gave me writing advice over iced coffee.I loved all the unique stories of King’s life that shaped him into the master storyteller that he is today. To read about King as a kid and how he slowly got introduced to the world of reading was pretty awesome since it all started there.As I kept reading, I learned this novel can hit you in multiple ways depending on what you want to get out of it. You can learn a ton about King himself, how he comes up with the horror masterpieces that he does, and of course, get detailed writing advice from one of the greatest authors of all time.It was beyond fascinating to read how King got the inspiration while growing up for future short stories, especially “Graveyard Shift” which is one of my favorites. I also thought it was great reading about how he met and fell in love with his wife Tabitha and how instrumental she was in making sure he did what she knew he was great at was astounding. It’s crazy to think that “Carrie” would never have been published if it wasn’t for his wife. King probably wouldn’t even have been an author if she hadn’t come through in the clutch.This novel teaches a lot, especially how important it is to work your way up through hard work, effort, and determination if you’re serious about being a writer. These were also some of the cornerstones I focused on in my path and I can tell you firsthand that King hit the nail right on the head with those key factors, especially with having patience.There are no shortcuts to this. It’s a lot of late nights, early mornings, and a lot of frustration. If you love it as much as you need to breathe and are patient, you will get there in due time. If you’re doing this for money or popularity, you won’t last. King confirmed that and even though I am nowhere near his level, I can at least say that my sports content has been read by millions of readers over the years and I didn’t achieve any of that success at first. It took me a very long time to achieve those levels which is exactly what King preaches about rejection and failure tends to come first before you ever taste success.Another thing I loved that King emphasized was how important it is to read a lot if you want to be a great writer. Even in my early years of sports writing, I always read tons of other sports articles before typing a single word of my content. It’s important to get those creative juices flowing, learn different writing styles, and start developing your signature by reading the best of the best. It comes with time and before you know it, you’ll carve your niche in writing.One of my favorite quotes that King said about this has resonated with me for many years now. I feel every writer should have this written down somewhere to read at any given notice...“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcuts.”Powerful, eh? Now, one thing to note about reading this novel is that King does indeed spoil a lot of his best and most popular novels. So if you’ve never read “Carrie”, “The Institute”, “Misery”, “Under the Dome”, or “‘Salem’s Lot” just keep an eye out when he discusses these novels and skip those sections. If you’ve read the majority of King’s work including the aforementioned novels, you’ll be fine.In addition to being very proud of what I’ve accomplished in the sports writing industry so far (being a manager now means less writing and more coaching but I love what I do because I do what I love), I’m also extremely proud of the impact when it comes to these reviews I write on Goodreads and Amazon. I am honest in everything I write whether it’s a sports article or book review. King confirmed a lot of what I believe in when it comes to the difference between a 5-Star and 1-Star rating for a book.It’s all about the story, characters, backstory, pacing, doing your research so everything feels as authentic as possible, and making it as tight as it can be by omitting needless words. Every single time I read a book and write a review, these are the core things I look for when determining my final rating. If I see fluff, I’m going to call it out. If I am bored due to terrible pacing, I’m going to call it out. If the story does nothing for me you better believe I’m going to call it out. All I’m looking for is to give me a great and memorable story and you’ll have me forever as a reader.I connected with King in this novel on so many levels and as a fellow writer, it’s a surreal feeling. This was such a personal, insightful, and incredible read that I will never forget for the rest of my life. It’s inspiring for someone like me to continue honing my craft as a writer and even though I write a lot more book reviews than sports articles these days, everything I learned here has sharpened the tools in my toolbox. You’ll know what I mean by that analogy if you end up reading this magnificent novel.Besides all the wonderful writing advice King drops on here and a deep look at his life’s stories, I’d say the craziest part was when he explained his near-death experience when he got hit by that damn blue van back in 1999. That was heartbreaking, emotional, and very painful to read. I can only imagine what that ordeal must have been like but to hear King break it all down including how he feared for his own life was intense.From beginning to end, this was a genuine pageturner and I loved how this twentieth-anniversary edition featured two sections at the end by his sons Owen King and Joe Hill. It was pretty awesome to read how King got Owen to record audiobooks as a kid for an allowance and a transcript of a fun conversation he had with Joe Hill at a 2019 event at Porter Square Books.I give “On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft” by Stephen King a 5/5 as this is a must-read novel for any aspiring writer. The advice given here is superb and will help anyone serious about this craft learn all the tools needed to be in a position to succeed. I know for me personally, even after two decades of being a professional sports writer, I still learned many things from this novel. I have never had the privilege of meeting King in person but if I ever do or if by some miracle, he reads this review, all I have to say is for yet another 5-Star reading experience he’s given me… thank you.Thank you for being an inspiration to countless writers across the globe. Thank you for sharing your writing wisdom with the masses and enforcing the principles of being humble, working hard, and killing adverbs one word at a time. Thank you for all the fantastic reading memories, creepy characters, and some of the best horror I have ever read. Thank you for always inspiring me <3!121!Nu-mi plac romanele lui Stephen King (n. 21 septembrie 1947). Cred că nici lui nu-i plac foarte tare. I-au adus avere, notorietate, și asta e tot ceea ce contează pînă la urmă (măcar pentru el). Nu pot să neg însă că este un prozator profesionist, cum nu sînt prea mulți în spațiul moldo-vlah. Sfaturile lui pot fi de mare folos celor care ar dori să se „facă” scriitori (și să cîștige bani mulți, fără număr, bani cu nemiluita...), deși scrisul nu este meseria cea mai bănoasă din lume, e mai bine să lansezi sateliți pe orbită ca Elon Musk și să debitezi tîmpenii. Foarte puțini prozatori ajung la veniturile lui King. În pofida rîndurilor de mai sus, observațiile prozatorului american sînt mereu utile și rezonabile. Nu-i simplu să fii scriitor, e o meserie horror, credeți-mă, dar poți învăța să potrivești cuvintele prin reflecție și printr-un exercițiu perseverent. Asta înseamnă să stai la masa de scris cel puțin 5 ore pe zi. Philip Roth stătea 8. Să reflectăm, deci, la îndemnurile lui King:1. „Dacă vreţi să fiţi scriitori, trebuie, mai presus de toate, să faceţi două lucruri: citiţi mult şi scrieţi mult. Nu cunosc nici un mod de a ocoli aceste două lucruri, nici o scurtătură. Eu sînt un cititor lent, dar reuşesc de obicei să parcurg şaptezeci sau optzeci de cărţi pe an, majoritatea romane. Nu citesc cu gîndul de-a învăţa meserie; citesc pentru că-mi place să citesc”.2. Un exemplu ilustru de muncitor: „Anthony Trollope scria romane urieşeşti şi le scotea pe bandă cu o surprinzătoare regularitate. Era funcţionar la Departamentul Poştal Britanic (cutiile poştale roşii răspîndite în toată Marea Britanie au fost invenţia lui Anthony Trollope); scria vreme de două ore şi jumătate în fiecare dimineaţă înainte să plece la serviciu. Orarul acesta era bătut în cuie. Dacă se afla la mijlocul unei propoziţii cînd expirau cele două ore şi jumătate, lăsa propoziţia neterminată pînă dimineaţa următoare. Iar dacă se întîmpla să-şi termine una dintre cărţile cu gabarit depăşit, a cîte şase sute de pagini fiecare, şi-i mai rămîneau cincisprezece minute din acea sesiune, scria «Sfîrşit», punea manuscrisul deoparte şi începea lucrul la următoarea carte”.3. Exemplul personal: „Programul meu e în linii mari foarte clar. Dimineţile sînt pentru lucrurile noi - textul pe care-l compun. După-amiezile sînt pentru odihnă şi scrisori. Serile sînt pentru citit, familie, meciuri Red Sox la televizor şi toate reviziile care nu suportă amînare. În principal, dimineţile sînt cele rezervate scrisului. Odată ce încep să lucrez la un proiect, nu mă opresc şi nu scad ritmul decît dacă sînt absolut nevoit s-o fac”. În sfîrșit, despre plăcerea de a scrie: 4. „Adevărul e că, atunci cînd muncesc, scriu zi de zi, obsedat irecuperabil de muncă... Asta înseamnă şi de Crăciun, și de sărbătoarea naţională, şi de ziua mea de naştere (la vîrsta mea, oricum încerci să ignori afurisita aia de aniversare). Iar cînd nu scriu, nu muncesc deloc, deşi în aceste perioade de inactivitate totală mă simt de obicei în derivă şi am probleme cu somnul. Pentru mine, a nu munci e adevărata muncă. Cînd scriu, totul e un joc şi pînă şi cele mai rele trei ore pe care le-am petrecut vreodată la masa de scris tot mi-au oferit o plăcere suficient de mare”.P. S. Averea lui Stephen King se ridică la aproximativ 500 de milioane de dolari. În topul celor mai bogați scriitori, se situează pe locul 5. În virf se află, nu mai trebuie s-o spun, J.K. Rowling cu peste un miliard de dolari. Rar, mult prea rar, scrisul aduce bani. Și nu neapărat sciitorilor valoroși.P. P. S.

I can see why writers, and budding writers find this book inspirational, and fans of his oeuvre will enjoy learning how certain stories came to be. But it’s several very different books and booklets, within a single set of covers - curious that a book about writing doesn't seem to know what sort of a book it is.In one of the three forewords, King says “Most books about writing are filled with bullshit”. I found a fair bit here, too. But I also found good things, including a passionate passage about books being a sort of telepathy, culminating with the delicious: “Books are a uniquely portable magic.”This book isn’t about how to write in general, it’s about how to write like Stephen King, and for that, it may be excellent.1. C.V. 4* (memoir, 118 pages, or 33% of the book)This is a charming scattering of snapshots of King’s childhood, and snippets of adulthood and advice; the CV of how one writer was formed. I enjoyed a peek into ordinary 1950s small-town USA. He points out that he is one of ""the final handful of American novelists who learned to read and write before they learned to eat a daily helping of video bullshit"". (He was 11 when the family got their first TV.)He missed most of first grade because of ear-related health problems, so retreated into comic books and writing stories in a similar vein. His mother always encouraged him, and the importance of encouragement is the strongest message of the book. Conversely, a teacher criticised him for wasting his talent writing junk, and King remained ashamed of what he wrote until his forties. (The “junk” was a novelisation of the film of The Pit and the Pendulum, which he’d been selling at school – unaware that it was originally a short story by Poe!)His wife, Tabitha, also gets much credit: her belief in his ability and her consequent encouragement, even when they could barely pay the bills. They have much in common, but “What ties us most strongly are the words, the language, and the work of our lives.”The other key message is that there is no repository of great story ideas. They come from nowhere. The writer has to spot, recognise, and polish them, and King gives examples of how he came upon the seeds of many of his stories. King points out that even the author’s perception of his characters may be wrong (I don’t disagree, and it may be related to his not realising that he was writing about himself when he penned Jack, in The Shining). But in a foreword, he makes a more extreme generalisation, “The editor is always right”. An interesting case study is to compare Raymond Carver’s short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, in their originally published and heavily edited form with his originals, now published under the title Beginners. Sometimes I think the editor was right, but in several cases, I prefer Carver’s version. I’ve explored the differences a little in my reviews: HERE and HERE, respectively.2. Toolbox 1* (grammar etc, 34 pages)“Writing is seduction.” Not necessarily. Reading this short section, the only thing that prevented me from throwing the book across the room was that it was borrowed from a friend. It does what most prescriptive guides do: conflates stylistic preference with grammatical rules, and makes sweeping generalisations (such as “the best form of dialogue attribution is ‘said’.”), largely ignoring the paramount importance of context and audience. It’s easy to teach and test rules, but serious writers need to cultivate an intuitive feel for language in a variety of styles, rather than being bogged down analysing parts of speech.King taught grammar, but gives examples of Tom Swifties that aren't, and keeps talking about the ""passive tense"", though later correctly says ""passive voice"". He decries it, using ludicrous, unidiomatic examples (“My first kiss will always be recalled by me”). He decries adverbs by using a convoluted passive (they “seem to have been created with the timid writer in mind”) and an adverb (saying writers use them when not expressing themselves “clearly”), and says both passives and adverbs are the resort of ""timid writers"". He claims, “The road to hell is paved with adverbs.” One is OK, but they’re like dandelions: prone to multiply. In section 3, he berates pronouns too, using a pronoun “I hate and mistrust pronouns, every one of them as slippery as a fly-by-night personal-injury lawyer””. Why?Strunk and White’s* (in)famous rule 17, “Omit needless words”, is lauded. It’s hard to disagree with, but it’s no help with discerning which words might be needless.King says this section is short because readers probably know enough grammar already, but he then agrees with Strunk and White, that if readers don’t, “It’s too late”. So much for encouraging timid writers. And yet many find this book helpful. I’m pleased for them, but a little surprised. There are some good points. He stresses the importance of an extensive vocabulary, and says it should be acquired through reading widely, rather than conscious effort. He describes paragraphs as “maps of intent” and “the basic unit of writing” (rather than sentences). And there is a nod to context, negating much of what precedes it, “Language does not always have to wear a tie and lace-up shoes.” Amen to that.3. On Writing 3* (how he writes, 143 pages, or 40%)And suddenly it’s back to memoir-ish, but with focus on the process of writing, and a smattering of prescriptive absolutes and empty homilies alongside fascinating insights and ideas. King promises “Everything I know about how to write good fiction.”, along with encouragement, but with the caveat that you can’t make a bad writer a competent one, or a good writer great, but you can make a competent writer good, as long as they master the basics in the previous section: vocabulary, grammar, and style. King stresses the importance and joy of reading, in all and any situations, developing “an ease and intimacy with the process of writing.”But for writing itself, he says you need good health (though poor health was what got him started, and he was successful when a heavy-drinking alcoholic), a stable relationship (don’t many great writers emerge from the opposite?), strict routine, and your own space (no distractions, and a door to close). “Put your desk in the corner… Life isn’t a support system for art. It’s the other way round.”“Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme… Starting with the questions and thematic concerns is a recipe for bad fiction.” The ideas about story and plot were fascinating and liberating - in stark contrast with the straitjacket of the previous section. You need a concrete goal, but “Don’t wait for the muse” and “ Write what you know”. He lists only three components of a story: narrative, description, and dialogue. Don’t worry about plot because our lives are plotless. “Stories are found things, like fossils” and the writer has to give them somewhere to grow (fossils… growing?), thus “My books tend to be based on situation rather than story… The situation comes first… The characters… come next”. Then there’s narration, and he lets the characters figure things out – not always as he expected. Ultimately, “The story should always be the boss”. The story, not the plot. “Plot is… the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’s first choice.” And “There’s a huge difference between story and plot. Story is honorable and trustworthy; plot is shifty and best kept under house arrest.” Huh? Fortunately, Bryce came to the rescue in the second comment on her review here:""Plot is a series of events. But story is about the motivations behind those events.""Her example is that plot is ""The king died and then the queen died.""The story is ""The king died and then the queen died of grief.""When you’ve finished the first draft (which you should never show anyone else for comment), you have to step back, to see the wood for the trees, and figure out what the book is about. Work on a second draft, then take a break and let someone else review that. “Description is what makes the reader a sensory participant in the story”, but you must beware of over-describing: “Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.” That sounds wise and wonderful, but I’m unsure how to apply it. Still less, “The use of simile and other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fiction”, when you’re supposed to be hunting down adverbs, pronouns and other allegedly needless words. “It’s not about the setting… it’s always about the story.” Absolutely always? I think not. So many of my favourite works of fiction are about the setting that I have shelves called Landscape Protagonist and Sea, Islands, Coast. “One of the cardinal rules of good fiction is never to tell us a thing if you can show us.” Never? Again, it’s the absolutism I object to. And then… relax: “Try any goddam thing you like… If it works, fine. If it doesn’t toss it. Toss it even if you love it.” Hooray. 4. On Living 3* (surviving a life-threatening accident, 22 pages)This is a moving addition to recent editions (and briefer versions have been published separately). King writes of when he was out walking in 1999 and was hit by a driver who could have been from one of his books. It recounts his serious injuries, multiple operations, and slow recovery. “Writing didn’t save my live… [but] it makes my life a brighter more pleasant place.”5. And Furthermore 3* (annotated example of first and second drafts)This has a very short story that King invites readers to edit. It is followed by an annotated version, with explanations of the suggestions. Most of them are cuts (back to “Omit needless words”). King reckons editing should trim at least 10%. The other key thing is follow-through, “If there’s a gun on the mantel in Act I, it must go off in Act III”, otherwise it will be either pointless or a deus ex machina. See Checkov’s Gun.6. Booklists 3* (books to read, mostly fiction)There are two fiction booklists, mostly novels, but a few short story collections. It’s a varied mix of classics and modern, highbrow and less so: King’s first/main list
Notes
I tried to read this with an open mind. I was bored by the only other King I've read (The Shining, my review HERE), and I generally abhor the narrow prescriptivism of ""How to write"" guides. Most of it defied my fears – except for the grammar stylistic advice. But what do I know? I’m not a published author, let alone one as successful as Stephen King. *For a strident critique of Strunk and White’s Elements of Style (beloved of many US students and largely unknown in the UK), see Prof Geoff Pullum on Elements of Style.Image source for classic Punch cartoon, “The Curate’s egg”:https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.co...!121!January 6, 2018 reviewI'm kicking off my fifth year on Goodreads with a re-read of the best book about writing that I've read to date. I've considered that On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft--Stephen King's contribution to the crowded field of How To Write a Novel, published in 2000--might hold this slot due to King being one of my favorite living authors. Ball players can tune out a coach who never made it in the pros quicker than a guy who did and was a superstar to boot, and I'm certainly more likely to heed the advice of a guru who didn't attain his divinity by mysterious means. The author of The Shining certainly had my attention.King begins his instruction by doing something I wish my teachers did on the first day of class; he tells us about himself. Raised by a single mother in Maine in the 1950s and '60s, King recounts his childhood, his earliest discoveries in fiction, his first forays into writing and publishing, his breakthrough debut novel Carrie some ten years later in 1974 and his near collapse from alcohol and drugs. The writing advice kicks in, covering vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style and much more. This was the book King was chipping away at in June 1999 when he was struck by a negligent driver while on an afternoon walk, and this life changing experience is recounted as well.Even when King isn't dispensing writing advice--and when he does, it's helpful to anyone from students writing a paper to writers with dreams of being the next King of Horror--simply reading his prose is a motivation and a delight. Holder of a Bachelor's of Arts in English from the University of Maine at Orono, King's manner or style has always reminded me of a character in a King novel, an English instructor perhaps, but more likely a guy who works at the hardware or auto parts store in town and who loves: 1) talking to people, and 2) helping people by sharing his expertise. King's forte is storytelling, with a minor in popular culture.-- Imitation preceded creation; I would copy Combat Casey comics word for word in my Blue Horse tablet, sometimes adding my own descriptions where they seemed appropriate. ""They were camped in a big dratty farmhouse room,"" I might write; it was another year or two before I discovered that drat and  draft were different words. During the same period I remember believing that details were dentals and that a bitch was an extremely tall woman. A son of a bitch was apt to be a basketball player. When you're six, most of your Bingo balls are still floating around in the draw-tank.-- I was born in 1947 and we didn't get our first television until 1958. The first thing I remember watching on it was Robot Monster, a film in which a guy dressed in an ape-suit with a goldfish bowl on his head--Ro-Man, he was called--ran around trying to kill the last survivors of a nuclear war. I felt this was art of quite a high nature. But TV came relatively late to the King household, and I'm glad. I am, when you stop to think about it, a member of a fairly select group: the final handful of American novelists who learned to read and write before they learned to eat a daily helping of video bullshit. This might not be important.-- ""What I don't understand, Stevie,"" she said, ""is why you'd write junk like this in the first place. You're talented. Why do you want to waste your abilities?"" She had rolled up a copy of V.I.B. #1 and was brandishing it at me the way a person might brandish a rolled-up newspaper at a dog that has piddled on the rug. She waited for me to answer--to her credit, the question was not entirely rhetorical--but I had no answer to give. I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years since--too many, I think--being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it.-- I wasn't having much success with my own writing, either. Horror, science fiction, and crime stories in the men's magazines were being replaced by increasingly graphic tales of sex. That was part of the trouble, but not all of it. The bigger deal was that, for the first time in my life, writing was hard. The problem was the teaching. I liked my coworkers and loved the kids--even the Beavis and Butt-Head types in Living with English could be interesting--but by most Friday afternoons I felt as if I'd spent the week with jumper cables clamped to my brain. If I ever came close to despairing about my future as a writer, it was then.-- I had written three other novels before Carrie--Rage, The Long Walk, and The Running Man were later published. But none of them taught me the things I learned from Carrie White. The most important is that the writer's original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader's. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it's hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don't feel like it, and sometimes you're doing good work when it feels like all you're managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.-- Put vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and don't make any conscious effort to improve it. One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed. Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind if it is appropriate and colorful.-- Two pages of the passive voice--just about any business document ever written, in other words, not to mention reams of bad fiction--make me want to scream. It's weak, it's circuitous, and it's frequently torturous, as well. How about this: My first kiss will always be recalled by me as how my romance with Shayna began. Oh, man--who farted, right? A simpler way to express this idea--sweeter and more forceful, as well--might be this: My romance with Shayna began with our first kiss. I'll never forget it. I'm not in love with this because it uses with twice in four words, but at least we're out of that awful passive voice.-- The best form of dialogue attribution is said, as in he said, she said, Bill said, Monica said. If you want to see this put stringently into practice, I urge you to read or reread a novel by Larry McMurtry, the Shane of dialogue attribution. That looks damned snide on the page, but I'm speaking with complete sincerity. McMurtry has allowed few adverbial dandelions to grow on his lawn. He believes in he-said/she-said even in moments of emotional crisis (and in Larry McMurtry novels there are a lot of those.) Go and do thou likewise.-- I am approaching the heart of this book with two theses, both simple. The first is that good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the right instruments. The second is that while it is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer, and while it is equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one, it is possible, with lots of hard work, dedication, and timely help, to make a good writer out of a merely competent one.-- Smith wasn't looking at the road on the afternoon our lives came together because his rottweiler had jumped from the very rear of his van into the back-seat area, where there was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside. The rottweiler's name is Bullet (Smith has another rottweiler at home; that one is named Pistol). Bullet started to nose at the lid of the cooler. Smith turned around and tried to push Bullet away. He was still looking at Bullet and pushing his head away from the cooler when he came over the top of the knoll; still looking and pushing when he struck me. Smith told friends later that he thought he'd hit ""a small deer"" until he noticed my bloody spectacles lying on the front seat of his van. They were knocked from my face when I tried to get out of Smith's way. The frames were bent and twisted, but the lenses were unbroken. They are the lenses I'm wearing now, as I write this.I could keep going and going with excerpts, which with only a few of the digressions that turned It into a 444,414 word kiddie high chair and Under the Dome into a 334,074 word boat anchor, are just by their free flowing honesty inspirational to anyone who seeks to communicate thought to print. Instead, I think I'll dust off my half-finished manuscript and channel the spirit of Carrie White to get to writing.January 8, 2014 reviewIt's not every day you can buy two great books for the price of one, but with On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, readers are treated to both an engaging autobiography of one of the 20th century's most prolific novelists, and his illuminative thoughts on the craft of writing. Stephen King had been publishing for more than 25 years when this memoir arrived in 2000, and while he's probably been asked ""Where do you get your ideas?"" or ""How do I become a novelist?"" enough times over to want to either strangle someone or answer that a book, I love how balanced and unassuming his approach was in going about the latter.Rather than document the genesis of every novel he ever wrote as if they were masterpieces (most are far from it, including Cujo, which King admits he can't remember writing through the cocaine and beer), or offer novelists a definitive instruction manual on how to become a bestselling author like him, King dabs his pen in each of those inkwells with welcome doses of humility and insight.King writes about his youth -- watching his grandfather tote a giant tool box outside for the seemingly mundane task of repairing a screen door, or writing Carrie in the laundry room of the trailer he shared with his wife -- as well as his near death in 1999, when the author is struck by a distracted driver.My greatest takeaway from the sections of the book which deal with craft is King's revelation that for him, writing feels less like dreaming up stories and more like paleontology, pulling a fossil out of the ground. A story is buried somewhere. King touches on the tools a writer can use to dig it up.Whether you're a writer, or a fan of King's, or both, this memoir is like opening up a safety deposit box you've been given the key to and finding rich stuff (to borrow an expression from The Goonies) inside.!121!The book is great and if you like writing, it is probably a must read.I could write a summary of the book, it is easy enough to summarize and there are only a few important points that King presents, but then I dont want you to get it for free. :) Go and read the book yourself, it is worth it. Rude? As King says, ""...if you expect to succeed as a writer, rudeness should be the second-to-least of your concerns. The least of all should be polite society and what it expects. If you intend to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society are numbered, anyway."" Here is are a few excerpts from the book that might inspire you to take my advice - If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.I’m a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, mostly ﬁction. I don’t read in order to study the craft; I read because I like to read. It’s what I do at night, kicked back in my blue chair. Similarly, I don’t read ﬁction to study the art of ﬁction, but simply because I like stories. Yet there is a learning process going on. Every book you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the bad books have more to teach than the good ones.It’s hard for me to believe that people who read very little (or not at all in some cases) should presume to write and expect people to like what they have written, but I know it’s true. If I had a nickel for every person who ever told me he/she wanted to become a writer but “didn’t have time to read,” I could buy myself a pretty good steak dinner. Can I be blunt on this subject? If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.The trick is to teach yourself to read in small sips as well as in long swallows.Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you ﬁnd something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your ﬁngers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening(or reading, or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. Perhaps even ecstatic. That goes for reading and writing as well as for playing a musical instrument, hitting a baseball, or running the four-forty. The sort of strenuous reading and writing program I advocate—four to six hours a day, every day—will not seem strenuous if you really enjoy doing these things and have an aptitude for them; in fact, you may be following such a program already. If you feel you need permission to do all the reading and writing your little heart desires, however, consider it hereby granted by yours truly.I love this book because it agrees with all my preconceptions. Feels nice to be on the right track. It is also quite inspiring when it comes to kicking you into putting on your writing cap.I couldn't resist putting in this anecdote about James Joyce as well:One of my favorite stories on the subject—probably more myth than truth—concerns James Joyce. According to the story, a friend came to visit him one day and found the great man sprawled across his writing desk in a posture of utter despair.“James, what’s wrong?” the friend asked. “Is it the work?”Joyce indicated assent without even raising his head to look at the friend. Of course it was the work; isn’t it always?“How many words did you get today?” the friend pursued.Joyce (still in despair, still sprawled facedown on his desk):“Seven.”“Seven? But James . . . that’s good, at least for you!”“Yes,” Joyce said, ﬁnally looking up. “I suppose it is . . . but I don’t know what order they go in!”Of course, the book is not intended just as a writing manual. Even if you never intend to write, the memoir is a wonderful graphic tale on King's life and like all his stories, it does not lack in imagination or entertainment.Meanwhile, let me get down to some actual writing...!121!Only Stephen King can turn an actually extremely open, transparent and useful writing guide into a quasi wonderful memoir on writing. A good book for both readers and writers. 7/122017 read!121!Stephen King — along with Jo Rowling and a handful other novelists —, is one of the most successful writers of our time (at least in commercially), with bestsellers such as The Shining, It or Misery. One might wonder if there is some sort of magic formula he is using to write his books. The secret, of course, is that there is no secret. This book, however, is an invitation behind the scenes of the author's work and career and a masterclass for aspiring writers.The firsts section is about King's childhood and early years as a writer of short stories when he used to jab rejection letters on a spike in his bedroom and worked at a laundry shop to earn a living. These were the years before his first big success, Carrie. King also speaks to his early alcohol addiction and how he overcame it.He then goes on to give precise advice and opinions on several topics that shed light on his fiction writing: discipline, vocabulary, grammar, narration, description, dialogue, character, symbolism, theme, pace, revisions, publishing, and so forth. The book closes with the story of the accident he suffered while going for a stroll around his house, where he narrowly escaped death, and how writing helped him recover.All said and done, while reading this book, the secret of Stephen King's success is palpable: his prose is crystal clear and totally without affectation or condescension. Even when he talks about the technical stuff of how to compose a sentence or a paragraph, King is often funny, smart, and always comes across as honest, sensible, and approachable. And (it's a foregone conclusion) he has a knack for telling stories — his own in this case —, in ways that make them straightforward, relatable, and moving.!121!Stephen King shares some stories of his past and some writing tips.This was either my fourth or fifth time reading this. I got it for Christmas around the turn of the century and I've buzz-sawed through it a few times before. The first time, I was just cutting my writing teeth. Now, with seven or eight first drafts of novels lying around, I came to the book with a completely different perspective.Most books about writing, as I've said before, are by people I've never heard of, and are akin to a psychic handing out lottery numbers. If he or she can predict that, why aren't they using the lottery numbers for themselves? Since Stephen King is the big kahuna, I figure he could teach me a few things.The biography chapters were my favorite the first time around and were still the most fun to read. I had vague recollections of these chapters, such as little Stevie needing fluid drained from his ears, and King's substance abuse. As a man who's skated close to the substance abuse abyss a couple times over the years, his cautionary tale seemed very familiar.The writing advice was helpful but this was in no way my favorite book on writing. It seems Old Stevie makes a lot more up on the fly than I'm comfortable doing. Still, his advice on omitting needless words and the second draft being the first draft less 10% seemed helpful. Sticking with your first word choice also seems like sound advice.I'd forgotten there was a section of 1408 included, in first and second draft forms. It was an interesting look behind the curtain and made a lot of sense.Anyway, if you're looking for writing advice, you could do a lot worse than sitting at the feet of the King for a few hours and absorbing what he has to say. I'll try to apply his lessons the next time I write something. Four out of five stars.!121!""The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better."" I've been a Stephen King fan since the 80s, but after reading this book found that I knew less about his life than I realized. He had a wild ride pre-publication and after. While the writing portion of this book might not be for everyone, any King fan will love the memoir sections. His terrific sense of humor and straightforward writing tips made this an enjoyable read. Right on, SK. Write on!""If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.""""Writing fiction, especially a long work of fiction, can be a difficult, lonely job; it’s like crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a bathtub.""""I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years since—too many, I think—being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that’s all. I’m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.""!121!On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, Stephen KingThis superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported near-fatal accident in 1999 -- and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it -- fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.

I mean, I knew I loved Stephen King and I already knew a lot of the things you learn in this book, but to read it in his own words is even better!The biographical part of the book was truly amazing, this man has come through so much, whether it's alcoholism, the drug addiction or the accident which nearly killed him. And he's so humble and honest about all of these things. And it just makes me admire him even more.As for the actual part where he discusses writing, it's so eye-opening to get a look into how he approaches his work and his stories, and where his ideas come from. I'm by no means an aspiring writer but found it fascinating to read about the do's and don'ts of writing. Some things are fairly obvious, but other things I never would have thought of!My favourite thing about this book is basically any time he mentions his wife, Tabby. It's like you can almost feel the love and admiration radiate from the pages. These two are couple goals!I thoroughly loved every single page in the book and didn't want it to end! It was one of the best King books I've ever read. His personality and sense of humour just shine right through!Absolutely brilliant.Update: listened to the audiobook in May 2018 and it was EVEN BETTER as the man himself narrates it. Highly recommend to all Constant Readers and aspiring writers.!121!Simply the greatest book ever written about the craft of writing. I have read it more times than I can count, and each new encounter teaches me something new. I imagine even non-writers would thoroughly enjoy Mr. King's memoir.!121!There is NO ONE I trust more than Stephen King when it comes to writing!121!Audiobook....

MOST PEOPLE enjoyed this book - ME TOO!King has great advice on storytelling & writing.....( I liked his ‘stories’ within his advice, very much, too) “Narrative-descriptions-dialogue”....A+ for Stephen King!!Wonderful audiobook!!!!121!I'm a fan of Stephen King's earlier works and a lot of the classic movie adaptations. I wouldn't say I'm a superfan, but since I am working on changing my status of aspiring writer to published author, I can use all the help I can get, especially from someone as prolific and universally read as he.We all know King is a master storyteller. So it's not surprising that for much of this book, he's doing just that. The first big chunk of this book is his ""C.V."" - a charming memoir of his childhood when the love for writing germinated and was encouraged by his single mother, his teenage years when he collected rejection slips from magazines, his young married life when he balanced teaching, writing, fatherhood and drinking. And then his literary breakthrough, with Carrie. After the ""Toolbox"" and ""On Writing"" sections he returns again to his story, recounting the time in 1999 when he got (almost fatally) hit by a weirdo driving a van. What I liked* he is so passionate about ""the craft""* he's pretty encouraging and positive - lots of quotable quotes* he writes in a humble, humorous, accessible style* we learn a lot about his journey as a writer* he gives so much credit to his wife, Tabitha* he uses many examples to illustrate points using his own work* he considers lots of reading to be essential (and there are two great book lists at the end - I just love book lists!)Things I didn't really like* his section on the writer's toolbox was really short, with a lot of emphasis on concepts that seem a bit basic (nix on adverbs, avoid passive voice) for serious writers* he's really specific about certain things (for example, in dialogue only use 'he said' or 'she said'), which I think is limiting * he's really NOT specific about most big things (this is my main disappointment with the book). Stories for him come ""quite literally from nowhere"", are likened to ""fossils"" that just need to be dug out of the ground. I have no doubt this is true for him, but uh, thanks. I'll just go and dig the fossil, and boom, my story is complete. He mentions that he doesn't plan how his books go, they just evolve with a mind of their own. He doesn't think about symbolism, it just shows up. He doesn't think about theme, but notices that it's there after the fact. Again, I'm sure it's true - I am not going to dispute the magic involved in writing. But if it's pretty much all magic, then why write a book about it?? Actually, he does mention that any decent writer reading this book doesn't really need it, or any other book of its kind. He's not into 'how to', and isn't a fan of writing workshops or courses either (hm). Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is I was really hoping to hear more practical writing advice about structure, what makes a great story, how to create tension, memorable characters, etc and I came up somewhat lacking. That isn't what this book is setting out to do.Still, everything this guy says has worked for him, tremendously (oops! there's a pesky adverb!), and I am inspired by his deep commitment to, and joy through, the craft.You must not come lightly to the blank page.!121!On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft offers an illuminating look at Stephen King's life, highlighting moments that shaped him as an author and revealing lessons he gained from decades of practice and publication. King is unapologetically himself, blending whit and honesty with sophomoric humor and the occasional curse word. For example, when discussing the sin of using passive voice, King provides an example of how not to construct a sentence, followed by the type of commentary one can expect to find throughout his book: How about this: My first kiss will always be recalled by me as how my romance with Shayna was begun. Oh, man - who farted, right? When it comes to writing, King offers advice in a comprehensive manner; he is concise and straightforward in his presentation of the fundamental approaches to writing that have shaped him as an author.  There is no Idea Dump, no Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers; good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn't to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up. King explains his approach to writing and reveals, without indirectly stating, that he is a discovery writer. He goes so far as to dismiss the validity of first plotting a book before writing. This was the only element of the book that warranted a raised eyebrow. Some authors are plotters and some are discovery writers. Readers are well advised to remember that either approach to writing is acceptable. From simple stories about writing newspaper articles as a child, to the gut wrenching tale of his recovery from a near-fatal accident, Stephen King's narrative of his own life is arresting from start to finish. On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft is a go-to book for aspiring authors, fans of Stephen King, and any artist feeling creatively stumped that would benefit from a kick in the rear.!121!This is one of my favorite books on writing and I've read it several times. Since it's also a well written memoir the structure as presented becomes an easy way to learn the art of writing. At the back of the book is a section he shows how he edits some of his own work. He also describes what happened when the van struck him while he walked on the side of the road. Absolutely chilling. This book is a great insight into a brilliant craftsman, one of the best writer's of our time. I highly recommend this book for readers and writers alike.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series.!121!One of my most beloved childhood memories was when I ran through the fairground’s haunted houses. Not only was there never a waiting line, but I also got to relive my favorite nightmares again and again - The same way I do with Stephen King’s stories.King states that the story is the most important aspect of writing. One testament to his storytelling ability is how absorbed I become with the story that I tend to miss the writing. FYI, He writes phenomenally. To confirm that point I went ahead and started reading Misery as soon as I finished On Writing. (At the beginning of Misery, the MC describes agonizing pain which was eerily like the pain King suffered from being hit by a van 12 years after Misery’s publication.)The book is broken up into sections, the first two I found the most relevant. ‘CV’ is chock full of personal anecdotes about his journey as an author which began by copying comic books at the age of seven. He gives readers a peek into his world and shows us that anyone can end up in poison ivy… Honestly, my favorite parts were getting the backstory of where his ideas and inspiration came from for some of his most famous novels like Carrie, Misery, and The Stand.Then he gets down to the nuts and bolts and equates writing skills to tools in a Toolbox (like any craftsperson you need a box full of tools) and then the rest is the Story. He gives the best and clearest writing advice I ever heard. Start with an idea and fill the rest in with imagination. Dig for the story. Each idea is a fossil, and like an archaeologist, we meticulously uncover and expose any other artifacts around it, until we fully excavate the dinosaur (story). To help illustrate his “Door Shut, Door Open” approach he provides an example of several first-draft paragraphs followed by his second-draft edits from his story 1408, showing where he omitted needless words and providing detailed explanations for the changes he made. Write a lot, read a lot. It’s that simple. No shortcuts, no secret formula.King is touted as “The King of horror”, that he taps into the collective fears of humanity and reflects them back on us, selling us cheap thrills that are akin to running through the haunted house at the fairgrounds. His son, Joe Hill says that it is the politicians who sell fear. While his dad’s stories sell bravery by making the argument that we can kick the darkness until it bleeds daylight.!121!Desde muy pequeño disfruto de la escritura, pero siempre me he limitado por miedo a no ser bueno, por no saber hacerlo o porque simplemente no tengo la motivación suficiente. Este libro ayudó a quitar cada inseguridad e incertidumbre sobre este miedo.Stephen King ha sido uno de mis escritores favoritos por un buen tiempo y gracias a sus consejos, anécdotas y recomendaciones, puedo comprender el éxito en su carrera literaria. Me sorprendí mucho con los orígenes de algunas de sus novelas y los consejos que recibió para poder seguir creándolas.Si tienes ganas de empezar a escribir y no sabes cómo hacerlo, este es un gran comienzo. Eso si, puede que si no conozcas de antes a King, te aburran ciertas partes al ser momentos muy íntimos de su vida.Yo me quedé con un gran sabor de boca, aprendí muchísimo y lo único que quiero hacer ahora es escribir hasta no poder más.!121!For anyone who’s a Stephen King fan or aspiring writer, this should be a must-have. I listened to the Audible that’s read by King, and I highly recommend it. King’s as good of a storyteller vocally as he is on paper. The breakdown of the book goes like this – the first third is about his background, and what lead him to writing. The middle third is about the mechanics of writing, and for me it was more informative than any college course. He discusses “voice,” and themes, and story, and dialogue, and characters, and how he develops and assembles each of these elements. The final third delves into the accident that almost killed him. Five easy stars!!121!It's rare to find an author that adventures into writing about his craft, but Stephen King, with On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, is not one of them. Great book: good tips (best one: write something you would want to read!) on how to write along with a nice memoir. Recommended.","['Nonfiction', 'Writing', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Reference', 'Autobiography']"
Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI (Paperback),David Grann,4.15,326248,2017,"In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And this was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.","***On October 20th, 2023 the Martin Scorsese film based on this book will be released on Apple TV. It will star Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Brendan Fraser, and Robert De Niro. With this top shelf cast I think we can be reassured that Hollywood is taking this story very seriously.***”Today our hearts are divided between two worlds. We are strong and courageous, learning to walk in these two worlds, hanging on to the threads of our culture and traditions as we live in a predominantly non-Indian society. Our history, our culture, our heart, and our home will always be stretching our legs across the plains, singing songs in the morning light, and placing our feet down with the ever beating heart of the drum. We walk in two worlds.”The Osage Indians lived in Kansas until the 1870s when the government decided that their land was too valuable for them to own. Laura Ingalls Wilder, writer of Little House on the Prairie, was confused as to why the Osage Indians were being forced off their land. Her father explained: ”That’s why we’re here, Laura. White people are going to settle all this country, and we get the best land because we get here first and take our pick.”I have to disagree with Pa Wilder about the ""getting here first."" Just the fact that you have to force people from the land that you want is stark evidence that you aren't getting to this land first. In the eyes of 19th century white settlers, Native Americans were looked on as a subspecies of human being who didn’t deserve to breath and certainly didn’t deserve to own any useful land. The Osage Indians were moved to Northeastern Oklahoma on a patch of ground that was deemed worthless. But was it?When oil was discovered beneath the reservation land in the 1920s, those dirt scratching Indians became extremely wealthy. The federal government, due to the Osages’ inherent racial weakness, deemed them incapable of managing their own affairs and appointed guardians to manage their affairs, white guardians. As an example, if an Osage wanted a car, the guardian would buy a car for $250 and sell it to the Indian for $1,250. The definition of guardian used words such as protector or defender. It didn’t say anything about exploiter. This is a tale of greed, but unfortunately, it didn’t stop there. It became murder.When the suspicious deaths of Osage Indians reached twenty-four, the fledgling director of the Bureau of Investigations ( It would not be called the Federal Bureau of Investigations until 1935.) J. Edgar Hoover decided that he needed Federal agents on the ground. Hoover had already been systematically removing agents from the program that did not meet his criteria for education level and impeccable character. The agents out West, many of them ex-Texas Rangers, did not fit either of those profiles, but Hoover was smart enough to realize that, for a case like this, spit shined shoes and snappy ties were not going to get the job done. He sent in Tom White, one of those disreputable former Texas Rangers. White brought some people in as undercover agents, and slowly the details of what was going on began to shimmer into view. Witnesses were disappearing or or would clam up when they were asked to testify at trial. One white man who was trying to help the Osage was mysteriously thrown from a train. Another was kidnapped. Building a case was one thing, but actually prosecuting someone was not easy. It became more and more clear that this was not the act of just one man, but a conspiracy. ”A conspiracy is everything that ordinary life is not. It’s the inside game, cold, sure, undistracted, forever closed off to us. We are the flawed ones, the innocents, trying to make some rough sense of the daily jostle. Conspirators have a logic and a daring beyond our reach. All conspiracies are the same taut story of men who find coherence in some criminal act. “--Don DeLillo, LibraMeanwhile, the murders continued unabated. Osages were shot, poisoned, stabbed, and even in one case blown up with dynamite. The ruthlessness with which they were systematically eliminated was actually terrifying. I can’t even imagine the level of fear that the tribe was living under. Death was not a nebulous unknown creature, but was actually embodied by members of their community intent on their destruction. The other problem was that white people felt the Native Americans did not deserve the money. The adage the only good Indian is a dead Indian was still in common use, especially if anyone encountered a situation where Indian ownership was in their way. David Grann has done a wonderful job of investigating these murders. Though some people were incarcerated for the crimes back in the 1920s, the more Grann dug, the more threads he found that led to other guardians who should have been investigated more thoroughly as well. The descendents of those murdered Osage still want closer. They still want justice, even if the killers are moldering in their graves. ”The blood cries out from the ground.”

The truth of the killings would traumatize our school children and make every one of us search our souls, of that there is no doubt. David Grann shows us that the systematic killings of dozens of oil-wealthy Osage Indians were not simply the rogue deeds of a psychopath or two in a small town in Oklahoma. The tentacles of guilt and the politics of fear extended to townspeople who earned their reputation as “successful” because they allowed these murders and thefts of property to go on, as well as implicated law enforcement. Grann outlines how the case was solved and brought to court by the persistence of FBI officer Tom White and his band, but Grann is not full-throated in his praise of Hoover's FBI. He leaves us feeling ambiguous, not about White, but about Hoover.The Osage Indians once laid claim to much of the central part of what is now called the United States, “a territory that stretched from what is now Missouri and Kansas to Oklahoma and still farther west, all the way to the Rockies.” The tribe was physically imposing, described by Thomas Jefferson as “the finest men we have ever seen,” whose warriors typically stood over six feet tall. They were given land by Jefferson as part of their settlement to stop fighting the Indian Wars in the early 1700s. Jefferson reneged on the agreement within four years, and ended up giving the once-mighty Osage a 50-by-125 mile area in southeastern Kansas to call their own. Gradually, however, white settlers found they liked that particular Kansas farmland and moved onto it anyway, killing anyone who challenged them, oftentimes the legal “owners”. The government then forced the Osage to sell the Kansas land and buy rocky, hilly land in Oklahoma, land no white man would want, where the Osage would be “safe” from encroachment. This was the late 1800s.In the early 1900s oil was discovered on that ‘worthless’ Oklahoma land and because a representative of the Osage tribe was in Washington to defend Osage interests, he managed to include in the legal agreement of the allotment of Indian Territory “that the oil, gas, coal, or other minerals covered by the lands…are hereby reserved to the Osage Tribe.” Living Osage family members each were given a headright, or a share in the tribe’s mineral trust. The headrights could not be sold, they could only be inherited.The Osage became immensely wealthy. The federal government expressed some concern (!) that the Osage were unable to manage their own wealth, and so ordered that local town professionals, white men, be appointed as guardians. One Indian WWI veteran complained he was not permitted to sign his own checks without oversight, and expenditures down to toothpaste were monitored. But this is not even the most terrible of the legacies. The Osage began to be murdered, one by one.When Grann discovered rumblings of this century-old criminal case in Oklahoma, he wanted to see the extent of what was called the Reign of Terror, thought to have begun in 1921 and lasted until 1926, when some of the cases were finally successfully prosecuted. The “reign,” he discovered, was much longer and wider than originally imagined, and therefore did not just implicate the men who were eventually jailed for the crimes. “White people in Oklahoma thought no more of killing an Indian than they did in 1724.” said John Ramsey, one of the men eventually jailed for crimes against the Osage. A reporter noted, “The attitude of a pioneer cattleman toward a full-blood Indian…is fairly well recognized.”What we learn in the course of this account is that a great number of people had information that could have led to answers much sooner than it did, but because there was so much corruption, even the undercover agents and sheriffs were in on the open secret of the murders. Those townspeople who might be willing to divulge what they knew were unable to discover to whom they should share information lest they be murdered as well. Grann was able to answer some questions never resolved at the time, with his access to a greater number of now-available documents.Why this history is not better known is a mystery still. Memory of it was fading already in the late 1950s when a film, The FBI Story starring Jimmy Stewart, made mention of it. The 1920s are not so long ago, and some of the people who were children then have only recently passed away, or may even be still living. Among the Osage there is institutional memory, and still some resentment, naturally, and a long-lasting mistrust of white people. Need I say this is a must-read?The audio of this book is narrated by three individuals: Ann Marie Lee, Will Patton, and Danny Campbell. Interestingly, the voices of the narrators seem to age over the course of the history, and it is a tale well-told. But the paper copy of this has photographs which add a huge amount of depth and interest to the story. This is another good candidate for a Whispersync option, but if you are going to choose one, the paper was my favorite.!121!Reading about injustice -historical tragedies--such greed - such ugliness---does something to us. It's hard to explain the depths of what transforms. We feel the anger... the incredible unfairness. We feel different- changed in ways - after reading a book like this. It's the type of book that makes me want to 'do something'. White people cheated Indians out of their land! That we 'knew'.... but there is much in this small book many people are not aware of. Author David Grann kept peeling off the layers of the onion....by uncovering the magnitude of the numbers of murders that took place within the Osage Tribe. --- His research gives us a true story of history that just makes you sick! And why? For those who have not read this yet.... JUST READ IT.... it becomes very clear. It will infuriate you -- but like the Holocaust-- some stories need to be told - so we don't forget. Having recently read Sherman Alexie's memoir- ""You Don't Have To Say I Love You""....... plus this Native American Historical story...........If the combination of these two books alone don't completely transform you about your stand about American Indian Rights ....SO MUCH SO .... that you're ready to rally for them - vote for them - protest 'with' them - fight 'with' them ....Then I sure don't know what will. Warning: This book can make you FURIOUS!!!! THE PHOTOS included of the Osage Tribe were beautiful!!!!!121!3 to 3.5 starsInteresting and eye opening. A scary true story of greed and racism in the development of the American West. This is one of those hard to read and accept truths of American history. If you enjoy history and/or true crime I think this is worth giving a go.My main criticism is that while the story is interesting, I am not quite sure it is book worthy. It seems like this whole story could have been told in 30 to 50 pages or in a Wikipedia article. It feels a bit drawn out when expanded to 300+ pages. Because of the length I was waiting for a lot more to happen, but it never really did.Also, the title of this book would indicate that there is a lot of detail about the formation of the FBI - I don't really feel this was the case. There were a few pages about how local law enforcement was too corrupt so they needed the federal government involved, but that was about it. Some may disagree, but I hardly felt that this book could be used for a history report on the start of the FBI.This book is recommended for hard core history and true crime buffs. If you like your history and true crime to be a little less textbook, this may not be the book for you.Side note: the audiobook is mediocre. The more I listen, the more I think I don't care for Will Patton as a narrator.!121!This book is haunting. It covers the deaths of at least 24, but in reality many more, members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma, the richest people per capita in the world, at that time. In the first part of the book we get to meet some of the people who were murdered. In the second part of the book we learn about Tom White and his men, assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to find out why the Osage were dying (by bullet, poison, explosion, and more) and who was behind the deaths. In the third part of the book, we meet the ancestors of some of the murdered Osage and learn how the crimes still torment the families of the murdered. Not only that, the author relates how he found that there were many more suspicious deaths than were ever reported. At first I thought I'd have a hard time keeping track of the people mentioned in the book but there are a generous number of pictures and those helped me to ""see"" and remember the various people mentioned in the book. I read the book on my Kindle Oasis and didn't realize how well pictures would show up on it although I wouldn't have minded seeing bigger versions. This book is heartbreaking for so many reasons. I don't think I'll ever forget it and that there are very bad people in this world.Pub April 18, 2017!121!I don't know why or even how, after all I have read, I can still be surprised at man's cunning and greed. I knew nothing about the Osage Indians, certainly nothing about headrights that provided them with a great deal of money.It is the money and the way the law was provisioned that made them a target for the unscrupulous and there were plenty of those. This is the story of the investigation into murders that until Hoover involved himself and his men, we're virtually shoved under the rug and going nowhere. Even after so many suspicious deaths, often in the same family. So we learn about the murders, a little about Hoover, more about a man who was known as a cowboy in the service and he would be the one who broke open this case. Well put together, though out, this book was easy to read and very informative. Some things were glanced over, maybe not as thorough as some would expect, or like but that would have made for a much longer book. Liked that the author pursued this even after the initial findings, going back over the records, finding missed connections and came to some additional conclusions.!121!Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann is a 2017 Doubleday publication.  A Conspiracy is everything that ordinary life is not. It’s the inside game, cold, sure, undistracted, forever closed off to us. We are the flawed ones, the innocents, trying to make some rough sense of the daily jostle. Conspirators have a logic, and a daring beyond our reach. All conspiracies are the same taut story of men who find coherence in a criminal act- Don DelilloThis is a stunning historical true crime 'novel' centered around corrupt and shameful politics, racism, and greed that fueled the ‘Osage reign of terror’, back in the 1920’s and was responsible for the birth of the first ‘Bureau of Investigation”-When Mollie Burkhart’s sister disappeared, and was later found shot to death, an investigation into her death, as well a bombing and a string of poisonings all aimed at wealthy Osage Indians who benefited from the oil found on their land, began that would eventually expose an incredible conspiracy. This conspiracy involved anyone and everyone, it seems, as the Osage were being systematically killed off. This included law men and lawmakers, all the way to Washington, as white men schemed to take control of the vast wealth the Osage were entitled to. Finally, with increasing pleas for help the FBI got involved in the case, but rife with corruption, they floundered horribly. Eventually, Tom White was assigned the case by J. Edgar Hoover. His investigation would expose men at their darkest and most unconscionable. It’s hard to imagine Hoover in this light, but he was trying to build his reputation at this time, so solving this case would be a big feather in his cap. I am ashamed to admit I didn’t know anything about this dark piece of history. This is a true crime accounting, but it reads like a modern -day murder mystery, one you simply can not put down, with enough plot twists to keep the reader right on the edge of their seats. While many true crime books are hard to read due to the creepiness and graphic details of the crimes, this book doesn’t really have that same, ‘don’t read it alone at night’ quality to it, but I was so shocked by what I was reading, I experienced plenty of shock waves, all the same. Usually, I find myself feeling a great many emotions for crime victims and their families, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt more sympathy than I did for Mollie Burkhart. My God!! That poor woman suffered such an incredible amount of loss, in unimaginable ways. But, I am also ashamed of the way the Osage was reated by our country. Men of power who schemed to limit access to their money, assigning them guardians, who could easily steal from them… or worse. They were treated like children!! Can you imagine having someone monitoring every penny you spent- down to a tube of toothpaste?? SERIOUSLY??‘The US government, contending that many Osage were unable to handle their money, had required the Office of Indian Affairs to determine which members of the tribe were capable of managing their trust funds. Over the tribe’s vehement objections, many Osage were deemed incompetent, and were forced to have a local white guardian overseeing and authorizing all their spending, down to the tube of toothpaste they purchased at the corner store. One Osage who had served in World War 1 complained, “I fought in France for this country, and yet I am not allowed even to sign my own checks.'The history that unfolds in this book riveting. So many innocent lives lost, so many lies, scandals and cover-ups, it’s hard to keep count of it all. But, at the end of the day, this book resonated with me because I learned some eye -opening truths about the Osage, which I knew virtually nothing, and came away with a much better understanding and deep respect for them. It also solidified, unfortunately, my cynicism about our government and what truly lies at the bottom depths of a person’s heart. Greed, racism, and the desire for complete control, at any cost, still governs our lives today. While I did feel a long overdue feeling of triumph, and relief that this story is finally out there, that some justice was served in the end, there are still many who didn’t get that kind of retribution or closure. This is a MUST READ!! I promise it is one of those books that will give you pause, make you stop to reconsider, and will change your outlook about the past, help one recognize that we are still battling many of those same issues in the present, which could, just maybe, keep history from repeating itself.‘History is a merciless judge. It lays bare our tragic blunders and foolish missteps and exposes our most intimate secrets, wielding the power of hindsight like an arrogant detective who seems to know the end of the mystery from the onset.” While this story chilled me right to the bone, it also broke my heart and tapped into a well of emotions, while teaching me a lot about a time in history I am so glad I discovered. It's a book we can all take something away from, and hopefully learn from it. 5 stars!121!It’s absolutely astounding that true crime could read like fiction. The dedication and painstaking amount of research is evident in this book with historical pictures that bring the story to life. This is the most powerful non-fiction book I’ve read to date. Embodied with gruesome details, heartbreaking stories and furious accounts of the Osage murders, I couldn’t help but turn page after page. Incredibly well written and put together. If you are wanting to learn about some U.S History, True Crimes, Twisted Plots and Coverups, please read this. Enlighten yourself to the injustices the Osage have endured. I’ll definitely be reading the follow up book to this!!!!121!David Grann’s ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ is a gripping and meticulously researched non-fiction narrative that delves into a dark chapter of American history. The book uncovers the sinister conspiracy that targeted the Osage Nation in the early 20th century, as oil-rich lands brought immense wealth to the Osage people, leading to a series of mysterious murders.Grann’s storytelling is masterful, weaving together the personal stories of the Osage victims, the dedicated FBI agents who worked to solve the case, and the complex web of greed and corruption that surrounded the murders. He brings to life the characters and the setting, immersing the reader in a world where justice was a scarce commodity.The book is not only a true crime investigation but also a testament to the resilience of the Osage people and the birth of the modern FBI. Grann’s narrative is both heart-wrenching and suspenseful, making it difficult to put the book down. He meticulously pieces together the evidence, making it feel like a thrilling detective story.‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ is not just a historical account but a thought-provoking exploration of systemic injustice and the quest for accountability. It sheds light on a forgotten tragedy, offering readers a chance to reflect on the complex and troubling history of the United States. Grann’s impeccable research and storytelling make this book a must-read for history enthusiasts and anyone who enjoys a well-crafted, chilling tale of murder, conspiracy, and justice.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter!121!This is a chilling story — hard to believe it's actually true, hard to believe I've never heard of this before. And mostly, hard to believe so many people could be so cruel and callous. David Grann, a journalist, has done an excellent job investigating and chronicling the terrible story of the Osage American Indian murders in the 1920s. In about 1904, the Osage tribe had negotiated a contract with the U.S. government; significantly, their lawyer was able to slip in a clause that all oil, gas and other mineral rights on their land were ""reserved to the Osage Tribe."" By 1917, there were huge oil strikes on the Osage land, and the ""headrights"" — each tribe member's share of the oil lease royalties — were worth many thousands of dollars. Tribe members became hugely wealthy. But then the vultures moved in: Congress required most of the Osages to have an appointed guardian to manage their wealth; most of these guardians were intent on fleecing and defrauding their charges. Local businesses would jack up their charges for the Osages. Banks charged usurious interest rates on loans. Some white people would marry the Osages for their money ... and some would kill to get their hands on their fortunes.   Three sisters: Minnie, Anna and MollieAnna Brown mysteriously disappeared one night in May 1921; her decomposed body was found about a week later, with a bullet hole in the back of her head. About the same time, the body of Charles Whitehorn was found near the base of an oil derrick. More deaths followed: some clearly murders, some unclear but suspicious (Anna's mother died soon after her of a mysterious wasting disease). Too soon, Mollie Burkhart was the only one in her family still alive, along with her white husband, Ernest Burkhart, and their three children.Government and private investigators came up with almost nothing (how many of them were complicit, and how many were threatened into silence, is a question that may never be fully answered). And sometimes, too often, important witnesses or persons who were helping with the investigation would be found dead as well. It became known as the Reign of Terror.Grann unfolds the story in a clear and logical way, with some fascinating and chilling details. When the Bureau of Investigation (the precursor to the FBI) finally gets involved, things start to look more hopeful. But the web of conspiracies and silence isn't so easy to take apart.Highly recommended. This is a historical event that deserves never to be forgotten. Grann deserves praise for helping to bring it back to light, and for taking the extra steps to investigate and report on what may have happened to some of the forgotten victims. It makes you want to weep for humanity, but there are a few shining lights in the story.""To believe that the Osages survived intact from their ordeal is a delusion of the mind. What has been possible to salvage has been saved and is dearer to our hearts because it survived. What is gone is treasured because it was what we once were. We gather our past and present into the depths of our being and face tomorrow. We are still Osage.""Initial post: I've borrowed this from a friend for a December book club read. I read this whole book in just two days - it was that gripping.!121!A good nonfiction book will read as fast as a good piece of fiction, all the while imparting new knowledge to the reader. Destiny of the Republic, by Candice Millard, is a prime example. Now comes Killers of the Flower Moon. Enthralling, it tells not only of the killing spree against the Osage, but the rise of the oil industry, the development of private detectives and the Bureau of Investigation ( the precursor to the FBI) and the political corruption of the day. It's a sad look back on the prejudices of the day, along with the numerous scandals. But for someone who came of age in the 70s, when Hoover was more villain than hero, it's interesting to see how much he did to bring the bureau out of its prior history of corruption and scandal. It was also interesting to see how White and his team finally put together a case after struggling to find hard evidence or live witnesses to bring the murderer to trial. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy an entertaining, enlightening nonfiction book.!121!so fucking fuck!121!If ever a story needed to be told, it is this one. Although I was aware of the general horrific treatment of the indigenous people by the white man, I am shocked and shattered to learn of the special hell the Osage people were subjected to. Because this history was so well-hidden, thorough and proper research was required. Mr. Grann was quite clearly the perfect person, as he uncovered and articulated multiple conspiracies. Although his affection and admiration of the Osage is evident, he miraculously manages to convey their circumstances in an objective, rather than angry voice. I'm keeping my copy, but I'll be buying another for my favorite classroom library. I cannot wait to introduce this book to 'my' students.!121!Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI by David Grann was a difficult book to read because of all the injustice to the Osage people and victims especially. What a horrible stain on our history. I wish it was a compulsory book for high school kids to read and discuss today. Would it make a difference? I don't know but there is so much white-washing in the history books as it is. This was a book for our reading group and I am so glad it was picked or I probably would never have picked it up. Great book!!121!Why I chose to read/listen to this book:1. as a fan of the true crime genre, I was intrigued by the subject matter of this particular book; and,2. my audiobook hold became available!Positives:1. this book is extremely well-researched! It includes the history of the Osage people, the countless individuals from all walks of life whose systemic racism towards the Osage and their fortunes led to massive exploitation, corruption and even several murders; and the various lawmen (especially from the newly-formed FBI) who made a dent into these crimes;2. information is detailed and well-organized into three sections: Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose family was deeply affected by these crimes; Tom White, one of the earliest agents of the FBI, who diligently investigated the increase of Osage murders, eventually bringing several people to justice; and the author, David Grann himself, who has uncovered and shared more information in recent years (through this book) about various atrocities that were missed or ignored by earlier lawmen;4. I learned more about how the American government, like Canada's, also sent Indigenous children to boarding/residential schools, with the intention of erasing their cultural identity; 5. the audiobook narrators, especially Will Patton, were quite authentic-sounding; and,6. following a GR friend's suggestion, I obtained a hardcopy of this book in order to visualize the people and places involved from the inclusion of various photos and maps (Thanks, Darla!)As someone who was totally ignorant about this historic event, I must say that I learned a lot! I highly recommend this book for those who also wish to do the same.!121!""We Indians cannot get our rights in these courts and I have no chance at all of saving this land for my children."" (Widow of Joe Bates, Osage Nation, 1921)No horror novella could possibly mirror the horrendous crimes that were visited upon the Osage Indian Nation in the 1920's. The catastrophic bungling of crime evidence, the leaks and sabotage, and the willful insidious behavior by unscrupulous individuals is mind-boggling. The devil and his cohorts wore well-pressed suits and walked among the honest and the God-fearing.In the 1870's, the Osage Indian Nation were driven from their lands in Kansas and forced upon rocky, worthless land in Oklahoma. The Osage embraced this land as a means of being left alone. That wish never came true. Beneath this forsaken land were some of the largest oil deposits in the United States. The Osage shared the rich dividends amongst themselves. But their new-found wealth came at a great price. The law forced appointed ""guardians"" to manage their growing bank accounts. David Grann tells this incredible story through the wide periphery of Mollie Burkhart and her family members. Mollie was an Osage woman married to a white man, Ernest Burkhart. It is through Mollie that we come to know the brutal crimes committed against her and her family and others living in this town. The photographs of Mollie, her mother, and her sisters will breathe life into this story. It will enrage you at the thought that these defenseless individuals died from poisoning, suspicious fires, and fatal gunshot wounds. No one dared to speak names behind closed doors out of fear of retribution. And insatiable greed turned hearts to blackened stone.Grann's story reads like a well-tuned work of pure fiction. But as you turn the pages, you are aghast by the hardcore truth that awaits you. Justice didn't exist on this Osage territory. It took years and years before a case could be brought before the court system. That is unless you could find a jury that was not lined with bribes. Years of ineptness took their toll on Mollie until a remarkable former Texas Ranger, Tom White, took charge. We will experience the birth of the FBI with the initiation of J. Edgar Hoover. The journey towards that justice was a long and arduous one.I came upon David Grann on C-SPAN one evening. I had to know the story of Mollie Burkhart for myself. I believe you will, too. ""The blood cries out from the ground."" The silence no longer exists and the truth, finally, prevails.!121!This book was nominated for a lot of awards, but for me it didn’t live up to it’s praise. The cold-blooded murders of the Osage American Indians was a tragic part of American history. Full of greed and racism. The book, however, was too long and repetitive. The greed behind the murders and the disregard for Osage lives was not enough for a full book. There wasn’t much written about the birth of the FBI either. I would have liked to have seen more.I listened to the audiobook and wasn’t impressed by the first narrator who talked about two Osage women, Anna and Mollie, for it seems half the book. Too much information was repeated. I preferred listening about the tracking of the killers by Tom White whom was sent to the oil-rich territory of Oklahoma by Hoover to get the crimes solved. 3.5 out of 5 stars!121!WOW. A heartbreaking history, masterfully told. Why did I sleep on David Grann so long?! (The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder was also great.)Seeing the movie is next! Pray for no blood clots since the thing is 3 AND A HALF HOURS LONG. 😱Update: saw the movie last night and it was HORRIBLE. I'm so mad.2nd update, cross posted from my community tab on Booktube: I had planned to make a book vs. movie video for Killers of the Flower Moon since I just read the book then went to see the film, but besides Lily Gladstone's performance and the fact that the movie's existence will draw attention to an important story, I have nothing nice to say about it. Making a rant video sounds exhausting right now, so I'm not going to do that. Instead, I'll just say I think the movie was unforgivably long (3 and a half hours!), the choice not to keep the early part a mystery (like it was in the book) was baffling, and Leo DiCaprio grimaced through the whole thing. I kept looking at the exit sign in the theatre, dreaming about the moment I could leave (I thought I was going to make a video, or else I just would have left.) I don't understand some of the good reviews it's getting, but if you care about my opinion on it, read the book and skip the movie. Or, if you do want to see it, at the very least wait until you can stream it at home. It is not worth sitting in a theatre that long. AND DEFINITELY READ THE BOOK FIRST. The movie will ruin things for you if you don't.Click here to hear more of my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive.!121!A fairly horrifying true crime story of the murder of multiple Osage Indians in the 1920s. Basically an extra-long New Yorker magazine piece - well-written, interesting history, a quick read; the last section drops the voice of god narration and provides some perspective on the practice of investigation reporting and digging through the historical archives in cases like these. (The author also discusses some of this in a Slate podcast interview, which is how I came across the book.) Some insights into the early Federal Bureau of Investigation and the forced relocation, assimilation, and theft of assets from Indian tribes, but both of those are larger stories that could be more fully explored in books of their own, beyond this particular case.!121!The depiction of human venality here will set your hair on fire. The Osage Indians, whose reservation happened to be on a major oil reserve, were in the 1920s set upon by an army of white grifters who murdered them for their wealth. And the entire white institutional infrastructure in and around Osage County, Oklahoma—lawyers, bankers, judges, retailers, housewives et al.—were complicit in the killings. Let there be no doubt: This was one of the myriad forms of genocide visited by the white man on American Indians. Were the Nazis much different in their ultimate intent? Perhaps more systematic but the impetus was the same: expropriate and exterminate. The book is an object lesson in concise storytelling. It contains nothing superfluous. It’s a stunning port-wine reduction of a tale. Grann has learned his lessons well from Truman Capote (In Cold Blood) and Norman Mailer (The Executioner’s Song) and has matched them exquisitely. A superb nonfiction novel. The short, compulsively readable chapters actually give one the sense of hurtling through the narrative. PS: Martin Scorsese's film version will be released by Paramount in Oct. 2023 and streamed on 🍎TV+!121!5★“He was six feet four and had the sinewy limbs and the eerie composure of a gunslinger. Even when dressed in a stiff suit, like a door-to-door salesman, he seemed to have sprung from a mythic age.”John Wayne? No, but if this had been written right after it happened and Hollywood had made a movie of it, John Wayne would have played Tom White, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Investigation’s field office in Houston. He was described as “an impressive sight in his large, suede Stetson, and a plumb-line running from head to heel would touch every part of the rear of his body.”This reads like a mystery. The fact that it’s a true crime history makes it as compelling as it is appalling. “Over the sixteen-year period from 1907 to 1923, 605 Osages died, averaging about 38 per year. . . ” The author mentions even more cases beyond that date, so who really knows?Why? Because members of the Osage tribe were considered the world’s richest people per capita! It’s quite a story.David Grann is a highly regarded journalist, New Yorker staff writer, and best-selling author. He could easily have called this “Osage Outrage”, but this title is much more memorable. The Osage refer to May as the time of the flower-killing moon, and Grann’s account begins in May 1921 when Mollie Burkhart is worrying about the disappearance of her sister, Anna. Anna is known for wild, free-wheeling sprees, but Mollie is convinced she’s truly missing. They had already lost their sister Minnie three years earlier under what Mollie thought were suspicious circumstances. Photo of sisters Rita, Anna, Mollie, and Minnie, healthy, wealthy Osage womenThe reason the Osage were awash with oil and money was that they had been pushed off their homelands in Kansas into a rocky, worthless area of Oklahoma. Oklahoma was anxious to gain statehood and needed to get this agreement in place first, so they were happy to meet the Osage request to divide the land equally among only members of the tribe. “The Osage also managed to slip into the agreement what seemed, at the time, like a curious provision: “That the oil, gas, coal, or other minerals covered by the lands . . . are hereby reserved to the Osage Tribe.”They already knew there was oil there, having seen the “rainbow” slicks on some water, and each member now had a “headright”, a share in the mineral rights of their “underground reservation”.Back to Mollie. About a week after Mollie raised the alarm about her sister’s disappearance, the body of a man was discovered with two bullet holes. Then a week later, Anna’s body was discovered – she’d been shot in the head. Neighbourhood dogs die of strychnine poisoning, a bomb blast wipes out a home and family, and people are rightly terrified.Enter our man Tom White (John Wayne) in the summer of 1925. He got an urgent call to hurry to Washington, D.C., to meet J. Edgar Hoover, the new boss. Hoover was always a controlling (and odd) man.“Hoover demanded that his staff wear dark suits and sober neckties and black shoes polished to a gloss. He wanted his agents to be a specific American type: Caucasian, lawyerly, professional.”(Later, Hoover obviously livened up the professional look a bit.)Photo of Tom White and FBI boss J. Edgar HooverTom White collected some good undercover operators he could trust and they moved into town as cattle ranchers and insurance salesmen and such. Nobody was sure who the next target might be, so they watched everybody.Each member of the tribe had to have their money managed by a white guardian, which gave these men (I think they were all men) tremendous power. “One Osage who had served in World War I complained, ‘I fought in France for this country, and yet I am not allowed even to sign my own checks.’”The guardians seemed able to issue invoices to these accounts for all sorts of supposed services, and the Osage were powerless to prevent it, in spite of their wealth.“In 1923 alone, the tribe took in more than $30 million, the equivalent today of more than $400 million.”The murders, the lies, the clandestine love affairs, the betrayals and overall Wild West nature of this period are all captured in Grann’s splendid book. His research is extensive, everything is footnoted with easy links in the digital version of the book, and the photographs are wonderful. Absolutely first-rate whether you’re a history buff or a thriller enthusiast!Here’s a talk by the author about the book. https://www.c-span.org/video/?427931-...August 2022 - First Nations Peoples and the FBI have both been featuring in the news lately (for different reasons), which reminds me that this story of their connection is still not as widely known as it should be. Read the book - it is terrific!!121!A fascinating story of a time I knew little about — the 1920s in Osage territory, Oklahoma, when the Osage became suddenly and tremendously wealthy thanks to the oil rights they retained on tribal property. During this time, Osage Indians started being murdered in mysterious ways. It soon became apparent the deaths were linked, but was it a serial killer? Multiple killers? As one can imagine, justice for Native Americans was not a high priority for white authorities, locally, statewide or nationally, until J. Edgar Hoover decided to use the Osage murders as a test of his new federal agency, which would later become the FBI. Grann brings that era to life with colorful descriptions and photos of many of the major players. Grann takes us through the investigation, which was headline news in the 20s, and even when we find out the results, Grann lays bare a deeper darker truth behind the murders that is even more chilling than what the contemporary investigators uncovered. No matter how much you think you know about the mistreatment of Native Americans throughout U.S. history, this story is cause for fresh outrage at just how badly the Osage were used, while at the same time affirming how resilient they were to survive it all. This is still living memory for the Osage people, even if most of the world has forgotten. A riveting true story.!121!“History is a merciless judge. It lays bare our tragic blunders and foolish missteps and exposes our most intimate secrets, wielding the power of hindsight like an arrogant detective who seems to know the end of the mystery from the outset.”-	David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon David Grann’s Killers of the Flower Moon is an irresistible combination: part history, part true crime, and part journalistic memoir, it sheds a bright light on a dark corner of our nation’s history, one that has been mostly forgotten with time. Following the American Civil War, the Osage Nation, which had been living on a reservation in Kansas, were relocated to “Indian Territory,” comprising parts of present-day Oklahoma. Unlike other Indian tribes, the Osage were able to purchase their reservation. Even when the U.S. government came calling, trying to slice and dice the reservation into “allotments,” the Osage kept their mineral rights. This “underground reservation” proved a incredibly lucrative with the discovery of oil beneath Osage land. In the 1920s, oil leases made the Osage some of the richest people in the world. As Grann recounts, they were able to build big houses, send their children off to fancy schools, and even, in some cases, hire white servants. It was a rare instance in American history where an Indian tribe actually came out on top. Unfortunately, it did not last. Perhaps, in America, it could not last. The Osage County of this time period still resembled the “Wild West.” Outlaws such as the Al Spencer Gang (which sounds like a band, but isn’t, but maybe should be, so dibs on the name) roamed the plains, murdering and thieving as in days of yore. At this confluence of the modern and the past, the Osage started dying under mysterious circumstances. Some died violently, shot execution-style, bodies left to rot. Others died slowly, poisoned by toxic substances that could not be identified (in much the same manner as ex-Russian spies in Great Britain). Officially, 24 Osage Indians were murdered in the so-called Reign of Terror. But as Osage historians have contended, and as Grann agrees, the true tally probably ran into the hundreds. They were killed for their headrights, and the access to oil money those headrights bestowed. Grann focuses his narrative around Mollie Burkhart and her family. The Burkhart clan was a prime target for the Osage murder(s), and one by one, the people closest to her began to die. Soon, Mollie feared even to leave her house. Grann does his best to unravel this nearly century-old crime, but you have to pay close attention to keep the many characters straight. Especially since – cue the voice of Keith Morrison – everyone is a suspect. Parallel to the Osage murders, Grann also tells the story of the rise of the Bureau of Investigation (now the FBI) under its demanding and particular leader, J. Edgar Hoover. Here, he closely follows Agent Tom White, a dogged investigator who refused to lose hope, even as some of the suspects attempted to buy off witnesses, co-conspirators, and the jury itself. Overlaying the murders and subsequent inquiry is the treatment of the Osage by white individuals and institutions. By a quirk of geography, the Osage ended up sitting on a winning lottery ticket. Even as they became, in Grann’s words, the richest people per capita in the world, the vultures started circling. The U.S. Government appointed guardians for the Osage, meaning they could not spend their money freely, but rather had to get approval for expenditures. Many of these conservators were self-dealers or simple crooks. The Osage were also charged ridiculously inflated prices. An undertaker hired to bury one of the murder victims charged $6,000, a present-day sum of $80,000. Grann is a journalist for the New Yorker. His article Trial By Fire, on a man executed on junk arson science, is one of the best things I’ve ever read. He is incredibly talented, though at times I felt he was trying to stretch this out a bit more than it could bear. The final third of Killers of the Flower Moon is a first-person account of Grann’s experience researching the book. He talks of uncovering new evidence, finding lost manuscripts, and interviewing Osage men and women who still live in the shadow of these crimes. I actually enjoyed this section quite a bit, but it felt tacked on, an unnatural extension of a story that had already reached its conclusion. Killers of the Flower Moon feel’s like this year’s Devil in the White City. It’s the title that will be on everyone’s bookshelf, wherever you go. I have friends who seldom (if ever) read books recommending this with passionate raves. It is a quintessential example of popular history, an accessible and well-paced look at an event that most of us have never heard of before (though, at the time, it made all the headlines). Based on my expectations coming in, this felt a bit underwhelming. That’s not to say I hated it, or disliked it, or even thought it was average. It’s good. It really is. I flew through it. But I’m not about to get David Grann’s face tattooed on my back (which is what usually happens, when I love what I’ve read). The highest praise I can give about Killers of the Flower Moon, the thing I appreciated most, is that it makes an important point in an entertaining way. Grann sucks you in with an old fashioned murder mystery, an early 20th century episode of 48 Hours of Dateline. But as you are pondering the solution, Grann is also delivering an evenhanded indictment on the prejudicial treatment of American Indians. Everyone who pays the slightest attention to history knows about the treaties, the broken promises, the reservation system, and the forced assimilation that accompanied America’s westward expansion. That tale should be tragedy enough. Here, though, you see what happened when a tribe actually succeeded, when they tried to play the game of capitalism, of oil leases and income streams. For their trouble they were patronized, treated as incompetents, cheated, and – in an unknown number of cases – killed with impunity. Killers of the Flower Moon is a riddle wrapped in a bitter chronicle of greed, bloodshed, and racism.!121!This is the best nonfiction book I've read this year. I've enjoyed David Grann's earlier work, but this latest one is just fantastic.Killers of the Flower Moon tells a story I hadn't heard before: The ""Reign of Terror"" in the 1920s, when white folk were murdering dozens of Osage Indians in a despicable attempt to steal their money and rights to Oklahoma oil reserves. This case occurred during the beginnings of the FBI, and J. Edgar Hoover used it as marketing tool for the agency.This book is rich with American history. First, there's the irony that the Osage were only in Oklahoma because the U.S. government had forced them to resettle there, after the feds decided to take Kansas away from Indian Territory and let the whites settle it instead. Then, once the indigenous people were settled in Oklahoma and oil was found, suddenly the whites wanted the land back. But the Osage had set it up so mineral rights were to stay within tribal families, which led to some whites intermarrying with the Osage, and then a rash of mysterious deaths. I really liked how Grann structured this book into three parts. First, we see things from the perspective of an Osage woman who lost several members of her family. Then, we follow an FBI man who is tasked with investigating the murders. Finally, Grann gives his perspective as a reporter working on the case nearly 100 years later, and we learn things that not even the FBI had discovered.I listened to this on audio, which featured a different narrator for each of the three sections. Actor Will Patton was especially great in the FBI part. I also had a print copy of the book, which I recommend looking through because it includes dozens of historic photographs (including the one mentioned in the passage below) and also pictures of the people and places mentioned in the text.Grann has an engaging writing style, and this is such an engrossing read that I raced through it in two days. I would highly recommend Killers of the Flower Moon to anyone who likes true crime stories or books about history.Favorite Passage  In Pawhuska, I stopped at the Osage Nation Museum ... The most dramatic photograph in the museum spanned an entire side of the room. Taken at a ceremony in 1924, it was a panoramic view of members of the tribe alongside prominent local white businessman and leaders. As I scanned the picture, I noticed that a section was missing, as if someone had taken scissors to it. I asked [Kathryn] Red Corn what happened to that part of the photograph. ""It's too painful to show,"" she said.When I asked why, she pointed to the blank space and said, ""The devil was standing right there.""She disappeared for a moment, then returned with a small, slightly blurred print of the missing panel: it showed William K. Hale, staring coldly at the camera. The Osage had removed his image, not to forget the murders, as most Americans had, but because they cannot forget.!121!This is a powefrul book on murders committed on Osage people during the second decade of the 20th century. The author is an investigative journalist and does a tremendous job bringing this tragic story to the general public. I was astounded and could not put this book down...!121!Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI by David Grann is a gripping true crime narrative of the horrendous crimes committed against the Osage American Indian people that took place in the 1920s and 30s.The Native American Osage are forced to leave their land in Kansas and relocate to Oklahoma where they unexpectedly strike a fortune . With 'headrights' to an oil rich prosperous land that attracts white prospectors and businessmen who lease the properties owned by the Osage families in return for substantial sums of money , they fall prey to the greed ,deep corruption and conspiracy , compromised lawmakers and laws enabling financial manipulation and exploitation. What follows is a series of murders of wealthy Osage men and women and that go unsolved till the newly restructured Bureau of Investigation (present day FBI) joins the takes over the investigation, headed by Agent Tom White.Extremely well researched, factual and gripping, this book gives us a detailed look into the racism, injustice and downright cruelty meted out to the Native American Osage - crimes that affected not only those targeted but their families for generations to come. The photographs and references make the story come to life.As the author cites - The historian Burns once wrote, “To believe that the Osages survived intact from their ordeal is a delusion of the mind. What has been possible to salvage has been saved and is dearer to our hearts because it survived. What is gone is treasured because it was what we once were. We gather our past and present into the depths of our being and face tomorrow. We are still Osage. We live and we reach old age for our forefathers.”Informative, heartbreaking and thought provoking, this is not an easy read but given the premise I’m guessing it’s not meant to be. I definitely recommend this excellent book.!121!Lies, greed, murder, cover-ups....what a frightful Halloween read. Except this one is a true story, which makes it even more frightening. This is the true story of the Osage Indians. How they were taken advantage of and belittled by everyone. In the early 19th century, they were forced from their lands and eventually ended up taking up residence on Indian territory, which is now known as Oklahoma. Then, in the early 20th century, there was found to be oil on those lands. They had a headright on the lands, which is a legal grant of land to settlers. (Yup, I looked it up.) Leasing land allowed the Osage to become some of the wealthiest people in the country. But the white people did not like this, referring to them as 'filthy redskins' and other remarks. The government even thought they were not educated enough to manage their own money, appointing trustees for each Osage Indian. The Osage had an allowance, very small, in which they could spend each month. When they needed money for something...sending a child to a better school, medicine for a sick child, they had to ask their trustee, who often told them no. And then, if it was not bad enough, they were being murdered.....for their land. It is one of the most chilling, true stories I have read (well, except Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders.)The book details all of this and the many murders of the Osage. It seemed everyone was against them. The government, even local officials, everyone. They could not stand that they had this wealth. It was found that the trustees appointed to them were often stealing money from them, in large amounts. And after a number of years, when the murders were not solved, and more were being committed, the federal government got involved. Oh, but what became the FBI CHARGED the Indians a large fee to actually investigate the murders. Nothing that was done in any other investigation. Sometimes I thought, how could this happen, how could our government do this, how could this greed and corruption go on....and then I turn on the news. Yeah, nuff said.Anyway, an incredible book about a time in our history. An utterly fascinating story that I'm so glad I read. When the book was released, the title alone hooked me. So I immediately requested the audio. Now, the bad part...one of *the worst* audio narrations I have come across. There were three narrators in total. The first narrator, read like she was telling a bed-time story, with over the top embellishments. Like she was telling me a story about a fuzzy monster under my bed when she was describing how a person was murdered. I wanted to stop, I really did. But the print version at my library....yeah, I would have been #72 in the queue. At this point, I was hooked, and just tried to put the narration out of my head. I looked at a preview of the book and saw it has tons of photos. So I have it on order and plan to revisit this one after I get the book.A highly recommended read! But read the print, your missing pictures pertaining to this history. And the narration is just dreadful. Plus, there are a lot of people involved in this story, and print can help keeping track, you can go back easily and re-read portions. I plan on reading more from this author and perhaps reading more non-fiction in general.!121!Novela escrita al estilo periodístico. En esta novela hay un trabajo de documentación y investigación ingente y riguroso. Sólo el hecho de remontarse casi 100 años atrás ya implica una dificultad extrema. Si además le añadimos un territorio yermo del oeste americano, un tema tabú como el racismo hacia los aborígenes y mucho dinero, de todo ello sale una novela de gran mérito. Me ha faltado una narración más emotiva, pero entiendo que, tal vez, no era el objetivo del autor y sí, más bien, crear un relato completo, comprensible y explicativo de unos hechos acaecidos a principios del siglo XX. Un relato muy duro y vergonzoso de una parte de la historia de los EEUU. Un genocidio en toda regla que interesa mantener oculto.Es muy curioso, además, conocer cómo se creó el FBI. ¿Sabíais que los primeros agentes federales no podían llevar armas de fuego?Novel written in the journalistic style. In this novel there is a huge and rigorous documentation and research work. Just going back almost 100 years ago already implies extreme difficulty. If we also add a wasteland of the American west, a taboo subject such as racism towards the aborigines and a lot of money, from all this comes a novel of great merit. I have lacked a more emotional narration, but I understand that, perhaps, it was not the author's objective and rather, to create a complete, understandable and explanatory story of events that occurred in the early twentieth century. A very harsh and embarrassing story of a part of US history. A full-blown genocide to keep hidden. It is also very curious to know how the FBI was created. Did you know that the first federal agents could not carry firearms?!121!“This land is saturated with blood”--Mary Jo Webb, an Osage IndianIn conjunction with the Martin Scorsese film adaptation in October 2023.In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. Prior to that they occupied ancestral land, and were forcibly moved from this land by white people who wanted to ""develop"" and prosper from it. The Osage, living on this barren land where they couldn't adequately live, suddenly tapped into one of the richest veins of oil on the planet at the time. Living well is the best revenge? Let's go back and take a helicopter shot of the rez, seen from above, where we can see every greedy scammer and criminal in the country descending on the Osage for a piece of their pie. You didn't know of this incident in American history??! Me, neither. You mean you didn't study it in History?! Me, neither. I know, it doesn't fit well with our ""feel good,"" don't worry, be happy, history textbooks. Good old American greed and racism, knock me over with a feather. And what was law enforcement like in the twenties in the American West? Who do you think gets to be cops? How much training do they need to have? What code of ethics do we expect them to adhere to? How useful is the forensic science of the time? Right, and none of the Osage in the vicinity get to be cops, millions are stolen from them, and it appears that up to 24 Osage Indians are killed in corrupt land and cash grabs. J. Edgar Hoover, beginning a federal crime unit with state of the art detection strategies and scientific acumen, sends a team of people who target and convict one bad guy. Hoover makes national headlines for the birth of the FBI; the lead FBI detective, White, is a national hero, and his team is lauded. Case closed. Justice served.Case closed? I rated this book three stars for solid but sort of plodding reporting after the second section of this book. But then Grann goes back to take another look; he goes back to talk to the Osage, years later. What are the obstacles to doing that, decades later?""I often felt I was chasing history even as it was slipping away""--Grann, facing destroyed evidence, lies, cover-ups, corruption, extortion. And yet he discovers that things are far far worse than anyone of the time ever imagined, and he can and does prove it. A disgusting American story we all need to know to fully understand what it means to be an American, and how to truly become better. ""It actually demolished my original notion of the book, which was really a story about who did it. And it became a story about who didn't do it""--GrannI still think the book is basically written, straightforward, largely unsensational, factual reportage, but it is ultimately one hell of a story, an horrific episode in the history of racial and economic justice. And by now you know that DiCaprio went to Scrosese and said why are you writing the screenplay from the perspective of the FBI guys? So they spent more time as Grann did talking to the Osage. As one tribe member said, it is not the film that the Osage woudl make if they had the resources to do it, but I am hopeful it is respectful to Osage culture. Which is not to say Grann is disrespectful in the least.!121!A good book friend of mine says that the best nonfiction reads like fiction, and Killers of the Flower Moon is that. I soak up any books seeped in culture. What I learned about Osage culture was a corollary to the compelling, deeply disturbing, Reign of Terror that happened to the Osage during the early 1900s. I saw this book covered on The View earlier this week, which pleased me because this is one of those important books you wish everyone would read. Compassion would run a little deeper, and maybe history would be less likely to repeat itself. While there were some difficult topics, and the book is centered around the large number of murders of the Osage who were killed due to greed, there was also good triumphing over evil and truly beautiful, selfless people I enjoyed reading about, like Tom White and Mollie Burkhart. I don't know if I'll ever forget this book or what happened to the Osage. Highly recommended to everyone.2017 Summer Vacation Book #3","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Historical']"
"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption (Hardcover)",Laura Hillenbrand,4.38,930918,2010,"On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.","I was cleaning up after the wife and I had dinner last night and there was a small amount of green beans left. There weren’t nearly enough for another serving to make them worth saving so I dumped them in the sink, but just as I was about to turn on the garbage disposal, I realized that to the POWs described in Unbroken those few green beans I was about to mulch would have been a feast they would have risked torture and beatings for. I was disgusted with myself for the rest of the night. You know the book you’re reading is hitting you hard when you feel that much shame for letting a tiny bit of food go to waste.Louie Zamperini is one of those guys who definitely earned that Greatest Generation label. The son of Italian immigrant parents, Louie was a rebellious kid who was constantly into one form of mischief or another, but when he finally channeled his energy into running, he became a high school track star in California. Louie was so good that he made the 1936 Olympics in Berlin at the age of 19, and even though he didn’t medal, he ran one lap of a race so quickly that he electrified the crowd and even caught Hitler’s attention.As a college runner, Louie held several national records and many thought that he’d be the man to eventually break the four minute mile. He was poised to do well in the 1940 Olympics, but then World War II cancelled the games. Louie left college and ended up in the air corps even though he was scared of planes. He became a bombardier and went to the Pacific after Pearl Harbor. Louie survived several missions, including one where their B-24 barely made it back with over 500 holes in it.While on a search and rescue mission, Louie’s plane crashed in the ocean, and only he and two others survived. With few supplies on two tiny life rafts, they’d endure exposure, starvation, thirst and sharks. However, after finally reaching an island and being captured by the Japanese, Louie’s hellish experience as a POW would make him miss the raft and the sharks. Starved, beaten, tortured and degraded, Louie also faces extra punishment at the hands of a brutally sadistic guard who singled him out. Louie and the other prisoners desperately try to hang on long enough for America to win the war and free them.I didn’t care anything about race horses, but found Laura Hillenbrand’s Seabiscuit an incredibly interesting read. She’s surpassed that book here with this well researched story. Hillenbrand creates vivid descriptions of Louie’s childhood, the Berlin Olympics, the life of an air man in the Pacific, and a Japanese POW camp while also telling the stories of the people around Louie.She also does a superior job of describing a phase of World War II that tends to get overlooked, Japanese war crimes against prisoners. The number of prisoners killed by the Japanese through starvation, beatings and forced labor are staggering, but Hillenbrand also shines a light on the Japanese policy of killing all POWs if that area was about to be invaded. Per her research, they were preparing to begin slaughtering prisoners in Japan in late August and September of 1945, but the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of the emperor probably saved those POWs lives. If the war would have carried on or a conventional invasion done, then mostly likely those prisoners would have been killed.**(Do not take this as my personal feelings about whether nuclear weapons should have been used or not. I’m just relaying a part of the book here, and Hillenbrand makes no argument as to whether dropping the bombs was justified. She writes that many of the POWs believed that the bombings probably saved their lives and leaves it at that. And if you feel like trying to start a comment fight about it, I’m just going to delete it so don’t bother. I left my sword and shield at home today and don’t feel like battling trolls.)Ultimately, while this is a book about people enduring incredible hardship and cruelty during war, it's a hopeful book, not a depressing one. Great writing and the care that Hillenbrand took with the people and places make this compelling reading.!121!Hillenbrand has broken the unwritten code for Americans to downplay the wrongs of the Japanese during World War II (other than Pearl Harbor) in favor of focusing on the egregious acts of the Nazis. My education in World War II history has focused on the Holocaust and the unforgivable damage we did to Japan by unleashing the atomic bomb. I appreciate all the research Hillenbrand did to bring us the other side of the story.Louis Zamperini is my new hero. I loved his charisma and endurance, both of which shined through in Hillenbrand's meticulous writing. I haven't been this invested in non-fiction in a long time. Even when she was talking about airplane design I was enthralled. And even though I figured Zamperini had to have survived his ordeal to give Hillenbrand an interview, I was still anxious about his survival. My favorite part of Louis' story is his journey to forgiveness and healing through his conversion to Christianity, especially his willingness to meet with The Bird and offer unconditional forgiveness. How inspiring and moving, his whole story, but especially his life after the war.I don't think I can pick up another book for a few days. I need to let this one settle before I delve into fiction that will feel meaningless after this.!121!Wow am I in the minority. I absolutely loved Seabiscuit, so I expected great things from this one. However, where Seabiscuit focused narrowly on a small set of characters and events, this was more sprawling, bursting with a poorly-sketched cast of characters who, over time, became nearly indistinguishable. For most of the middle section, the book wore me down with its unrelenting catalogue of abuse and privation. On a related note, I wasn't crazy about the fact that the book endlessly described what was happening to Zamperini, as opposed to what was going through his mind, what gave him hope, etc.--material that I would have found infinitely more interesting. As other reviewers have noted, although listed as non-fiction, the book suffers from potentially unreliable narration, as most details were reported to the author some 50 years after the fact. After that long, memories of events dim or, conversely, are embellished. Indeed, some details felt a bit off to me (for instance, Zamperini described being tangled up in wires and going down with his plane when he blacked out; he was miraculously free of all encumbrances when he came to). A huge detail that seemed off was Zamperini's redemption at the end: it didn't make sense to me that Zamperini's problems with alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rage, fueled by years of the aforementioned abuse and privation, were all completely and conveniently cured by a couple of hours listening to the preaching of Billy Graham. (To be honest, I thought this plot point tends to demean veterans' struggles generally.) But the book moved along at a brisk pace and held my attention. I feel like I learned a lot about an aspect of American and WWII history that may be overlooked (the experiences of POWs in Japan was never covered in any of my high school or college history classes). So for that I give this book an enthusiastic 3 stars.!121!I’ve seen recently that negative commentary or reviews about this book invoke a kind of backlash normally reserved for non-conformists who critique the Bible, The Diary of Ann Frank, The Last Lecture, or any Oprah 'Book of the Month'. Well, brace yourself because here comes another one. This book is a poorly written, exaggerated, sensationalized version of a true story, an over-hyped pop history book more concerned with drumming home the message that the human spirit can be indestructible in the face of extreme adversity (a pet theme for the author it seems) than in being a tight and accurate biography of a war hero. I had the feeling throughout the book that the “true story” was buried somewhere deep in the pages, struggling to get past the hyperbole and over-the-top events to floor the reader with what really happened. It’s instead mired in the monotonous descriptions of our protagonist’s lurid misfortunes and maltreatment, told in mind-numbing detail, and never really allowed to break free. Judging by the notes, Laura Hillenbrand has put in a respectable amount of research yet the way in which she weaves the facts into the book is so sloppy and lacking any hint of subtlety it leaves you feeling like you’re reading a first draft script for a Michael Bay flick (remains to be seen if you are). The resulting story is horrendously tedious, repetitive, and – despite the fascinating subject and the stage where it’s all taking place – boring as all hell. The first part of the book takes us from Louie’s humble beginnings through his meteoric rise to the Olympics. The second part involves Louie’s time in the military and all of his oftentimes unbelievable achievements. The third is the account of his B-24 bomber crash, subsequent loss at sea, capture by the Japanese, and the endless rounds of torture and beatings. The fourth and last part is his rescue life after the War and finding God with Billy Graham. How can this be made boring? Well, it can if your prose never rises above a dull, rambling, ill-constructed narrative about how this event happened, then this one did, and then this thing happened after that.The characters in the book are so shallow and one-dimensional, hardly a one is given more than a passing intro before the story bumbles on to the next thinly veiled anecdote. The people begin blurring into the next and you’re left struggling to tell one cardboard person from another. Apart from Louie and his family the only other characters that really stood out were his raft mate and best buddy Phil and his most sadistic prison guard dubbed The Bird. Every minute of every one of Louie’s beatings by The Bird is documented to the nth degree; every one of The Bird’s tantrums, mood changes, facial tics, and spazz attacks is written about in the most curious of detail. The reader is subjected to dozens of ""last sightings"" of The Bird only to have him ""shockingly"" resurface in the most unlikely of situations a chapter later. You know the kind of scene I mean: ""And Louie looked up at the new arrival only to discover once again –"" Dah dum duuuuuuum!!! ""—that it was The Bird!"" This can only be pulled so many times before the reader starts to feel like they’re being strongly manipulated by the author. It happens so often in fact you start to think of it as a good candidate for some kind of literary drinking game where you take a shot of bourbon every time he shows up.Now, far be it for me to disparage war veterans, especially POWs who’ve endured the kinds of crushing abuse that Louie and his fellow service men have, but how is it that we are able to get such detailed minutia over 50 years after it all went down? I’ll bet you can’t describe the full details of the days of your wedding, your first child being born, your first car crash, your first date, getting your driver’s license, etc. These were all life-changing, and in some cases traumatic, days in your life and it’s a safe bet that most, if not all, of these events took place more recently for you than 50 years ago. Most of us remember scant bits and pieces of events and many of these memories have “drifted” from reality in our fallible brains. Even polling spectators who were there at the time and cobbling together all of the recollections won’t make for a fully fleshed-out memory. This thought kept rattling around my brain as I made my way through the book. How on earth could these things be recalled so clearly and precisely after all that time? I’ve read other POW accounts that say that all days start to blur together and the extreme horrors the soldiers endured are blocked out of memory. Some soldiers, as Hillenbrand herself says in the book, forget the war entirely. The sneaking suspicion (and you can’t help but feel like a total shit for thinking it) is that a lot of the filler put in the book to string the anecdotes together is fabricated to puff up the story to appeal to a broader audience.These suspected filler bits are nothing compared to some of the fantastical events scattered throughout the book. Zemperini is cheapened and the readers are dared not to roll their eyes as he is aggrandized and endlessly adulated from a man to a superhuman demi-god. He can withstand plane crashes, hourly beatings for over a year, prolonged starvation, backbreaking physical labor, diseases, and anything else that can be dished out. Consider his scenes of fist-fighting sharks in open water, meeting Hitler after his Olympic race, running a 4:12 mile -- in the fucking sand(!!), surviving violent dysentery for weeks on end with only scant handfuls of polluted water to drink (not to mention the “death sentence” disease beriberi that he contracted and overcame, despite it being untreated), blacking out as he’s tangled in wires in his sinking bomber only to wake up untangled and able to swim freely to the surface, self-repairing a broken nose and leg while at prison camp, and living through 40+ days at sea with practically no water or food then having the patience to wait offshore overnight once he reaches an island -- of course, just in time for a typhoon to hit them in their raft! Seriously? These personal achievements are apart from his sufferings in a group setting like enduring over 220 punches in the face during one camp thrashing and moving 20 – 30 tons (yes, TONS -- 40,000 to 60,000 U.S. pounds) of material at a rail yard in a day. Why the author stopped there and didn’t throw in a cage match with a silverback gorilla to determine alpha male dominance I’m not sure.I imagine therein lies part of the reason why this book resonates so deeply with our intelligence-starved society today. Long titillated by years of reality TV, Saw movie sequels, and other torture porn many are conditioned to be drawn to the grisly and violent story of a guy who went through hell and made it to the “million dollar vote” by the end. It’s the car crash scene you slowly drive by and can’t pull your eyes away from (""Can you pull those bodies closer to me so I can get a better look?""). I also suspect the book serves as a keen display to whiners in search of inspiration that hey, maybe my life ain’t so bad after all.I say hats off to Louis Zamperini and his fellow soldiers. Seriously. A toast! I have nothing but bottomless admiration, respect, and gratitude for his service and am in awe of his mettle and perseverance. He is one tough-as-nails guy whose achievements should not be overlooked and never be forgotten. It just would have been nice if his story could have been told in a more honest and fair manner, letting the facts speak for themselves without all the earnest dramatization, unabashed hero worship, and hyperbole slathered so thickly over them. His autobiography ""Devil at My Heels"" maybe?!121!”If I knew I had to go through those experiences again,” he finally said, “I’d kill myself.”

Louis Zamperini was a precocious child. He was always finding creative ways to get himself in trouble. He was desperate for any attention. Causing trouble is one way to get it, another way is to become really, really good at something. His brother Pete, a multi-sport star athlete, forced him into cross country and track in the hopes of keeping him out of trouble. The running, at first, felt like a punishment for all of Louis’s misdeeds, but then something clicked over and he discovered that not only did he like running, but that he had an aptitude for it. He started winning races and then he started breaking records. I went out for cross country my senior year of high school not because I had a burning desire to run, but because I wanted to get in shape for basketball season. The football coach had visions of me being a tall, reasonably fast, wide receiver. I had visions of a helmet crashing into my knee ending not only a short lived football career, but also wiping out my penultimate season of basketball. On the cross country team was a guy named Roger. His father had been an Olympic athlete. He had qualified for the games in Mexico, drank the water, and became too sick to compete. Roger had dreams of the Olympics in his future. I had a much smaller goal of improved stamina for basketball. By the time the first race rolls around I’m still not sure how I will stack up with the other runners. With Roger beating me easily every day at practice I was more worried about embarrassing myself. At this point I had no racing strategy, no thought except finishing two miles. The gun sounds, everybody takes off in a stampede. At about the one mile marker I started passing scads of runners who were flagging. I was thinking am I outpacing myself here? Am I going to run out of gas? Then up ahead I caught a flash of Phillipsburg Panther blue. I could see Roger! He was duking it out with a pair of twins from a rival city. The stories that Zamperini told the author about runners elbowing, pushing, gouging...all true. Of course Roger wasn’t worried about how long he took to run the race he was just putting a pace out there that eliminated all but his most formidable opponents. When the finish line came into sight he kicked down the afterburners and won with ease. I finished 6th out of 65 runners, suddenly running took on a new meaning for me. I was descended on by the local radio, television, and newspaper reporters. They asked me about the upcoming basketball season, a sport with a lot more interest to the community than cross country. They did ask me a few questions about the race which I couldn’t really answer because I wasn’t really sure how I managed to come in 6th. I looked over at Roger who was sitting on the ground changing out of his running shoes. No one was asking him any questions. I wish I’d motioned him over or walked over to him bringing the people asking questions with me, but I was still trying to make sense of everything. He told me later that he was just glad I was bringing some attention to the program. He was magnanimous, but I felt about four inches tall. Louis and Roger would have understood each other perfectly. They knew all they had to do was keep winning and eventually the world would notice. 

Louis Zamperini’s Olympic passport.I never did learn to love running, but I did love competing. Laura Hillenbrand knows how to tell a story. Readers will find the descriptions of Zamperini's races leading up to the Olympics much more compelling than they think, even if they don’t have an interest in sports. Zamperini qualified in the 5000 meters by the skin of his teeth for the historic 1936 Olympic Games. Jesse Owens was the story that year. He was putting a finger in Adolf Hitler’s eyes every time he stepped onto the track. Zamperini finished eighth, but he was determined to return in 1940 and win a fist full of medals. The wheel of fortune landed on a different fate for Louis Zamperini.

B-24 diagramWorld War Two put a crimp in many plans, dreams were put on hold, careers were set aside, and marriages were speeded up. Zamperini ended up a bombardier in a B-24. His job of dropping bombs on the Japanese was hazardous enough, but when a commanding officer ordered his crew up in a plane that flew “mushy” and had been stripped of all nonessential parts he was certainly tempting fate. The plane was called The Green Hornet and just like the movie by the same name it crashed and burned. Three members of the crew survived and Zamperini was one of the fortunate few. 

The Bucket of Bolts that dropped the boys into the Pacific. I always love the airplane artwork.After drifting for months, surviving by sheer grit and determination, they are picked up as prisoners of war by the Japanese. Life has got to improve, right? After all they don’t have sharks rubbing at the bottom of their survival raft every day and every night. They don’t have to worry about where their next drink of water is going to come from or their next meal.Wrong. The shark metamorphosis into a Bird, the Bird is Matsuhiro Watanabe. He is a psychopath who actually became sexually aroused beating up helpless prisoners. When the movie comes out this guy is going to be known the world over as one of the sickest most despicable human beings to ever exist. The list of charges against him, at the end of the war, were a stream of paper eight feet long. 

Matsuhiro “the Bird” WatanabeHis favorite target: Lieutenant Louis Zamperini. ”The Pacific POWs who went home in 1945 were torn-down men. They had an intimate understanding of man’s vast capacity to experience suffering, as well as his equally vast capacity, and hungry willingness to inflict it. They carried unspeakable memories of torture and humiliation, and an acute sense of vulnerability that attended the knowledge of how readily they could be disarmed and dehumanized.”I was surprised to learn that my own understanding of the treatment of POWs under the Japanese was sketchy at best. I’m still processing the images invoked from recently reading The Devil of Nanking about the massacres at Nanking in 1937. Like the Nazis the Japanese at this time were interested in the purity of their own race. They felt that as a superior race it was their place to rule all of Asia. They believed that to surrender was cowardly and dishonorable behavior. This belief led to some very erratic aggressive behavior by Japanese soldiers who would rather die than be taken prisoner. So The Bird was a corporal who had been turned down for an officer’s position, this humiliation infuriated him. He despised these American soldiers who had surrendered and he especially despised the officers. More than 37% of Americans held captive by the Japanese died. Only 1% of Americans held by the Nazis and Italians died. The Japanese guards were brutal and sadistic and at the end of the war many of them were prosecuted and executed. This changed as the Americans discovered that Japan would prove a valuable ally in the upcoming Cold War. The prosecution of further war criminals became a political stumbling block and were stopped. I reached a point where I wondered why Louis Zamperini continued to want to live. He was too strong, too stubborn, too competitive to give up. When he crashed, his parents didn’t know he survived. They were kept in nervous, soul crushing suspense because a demented Corporal decided that the POWs under his command would not be able to write home. Laura Hillenbrand could have let the behavior of the Japanese guards weigh this book down into a horrific tale of depressing stories of physical and mental abuse, but though she does share a lot of those stories with us they are uplifted by the sheer determination of Zamperini not only to live, but to get one chance to wrap his hands around the neck of his tormentor. This book had me considering who we are when we go to war. Why do so many leave their homes as fathers, husbands, brothers and become this shockingly terrifying person capable of the most sadistic behavior? War is hell. I know that, but there is a huge difference between killing someone in self defense on a battlefield and quite another to systematically, with creativity, torture people. The Rape of Nanking or the abuse of POWs defies all logic. These soldiers are not criminals or murderers. These are normal people until they are put in a uniform; and then, somehow they transform into criminals and murderers.

Laura Hillenbrand with Louis ZamperiniHillenbrand includes a plethora of pictures all placed in with the text so you can look at a picture of what she is describing as you read it. I wish more publishers would do this for more books. It really enhances the experience. Hillenbrand is an excellent writer with a gift for storytelling. She adds in these wonderful details that really bring the story to life, so instead of waiting for the movie pick up the book and marvel at the capacity of humans to survive and bring their lives back from the brink of despair. Survival, Resilience, and Redemption are the subtitle of this book. You will end the book knowing and believing that Louis Zamperini exemplified all those qualities in the face of impossible odds.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten!121!Louie Zamperini was quite a character, wild, given to mayhem and thievery, but he straightened out enough to become a world-class runner, joining the US team in the Berlin Olympics. He continued his athletic career at USC, setting running records there, preparing for the next international competition. But the world would skip that event, leaving Louie adrift. He joined the military and washed out, but he was drafted back in after Pearl Harbor, as a bombardier. When Louie’s plane went down in the middle of the Pacific, while on a bombing run, his great adventure began. Unbroken is Louie’s tale of survival. Laura Hillenbrand - image from FlavorwireLouie and two other crew members would drift for an unthinkable duration before sighting land, struggling to collect potable water, desperate to catch fish and birds for food and terrified of being devoured by the constantly marauding sharks. Once they finally landed it was out of the frying pan and into the rising sun, as they were taken prisoner by the Japanese. Enduring years of the beatings, deprivations, forced labor and humiliations that were daily fare in Japanese POW camps made their ocean voyage seem like a pleasure cruise. This is not only an amazingly researched book, with details that clearly took serious, serious digging to unearth, but Laura Hillenbrand is a gifted story-teller, as any who have read Seabiscuit can attest, and she brings her narrative skills to this remarkable, real-life tale. Having introduced Louie in the early chapters and providing reasons to care, she documents a relentless sequence of trials that he and his mates had to endure. It does get a little repetitive, but there were times when the hairs on my arm stood up and saluted and I had to put the book down because the horrors these men faced were so frightening and upsetting. Think Jaws vs a rubber raft. But I was so captivated by the story that I dove right back in after a short break. The unpleasantness of the Geneva-challenged WW II Japanese military was not news to me, but the details Hillenbrand provides gave that vision considerable depth. There is a psycho-guard character in this story who would fit in well in many a horror film. And yet, with all the monstrtosities of the camps, there is also Hogan’s Heroes-type humor that will make you laugh out loud. Louis ZamperiniLouie’s life post-liberation was no picnic either. PTSD was not in the lexicon at the time, but anyone today would recognize the symptoms. Even though the unspeakable horrors he endured had not killed him, the internalized terrors he brought home might have finished the job. Hillenbrand takes us through those trials and tells the surprising story of how this incredibly strong, but seriously damaged man, was mended.Unbroken offers an important portrait about a dark time, but shows how strength, courage, incredible determination and a dose of faith can overcome any obstacle. You will weep, rage, laugh and cheer. What more can a reader ask?==============================EXTRA STUFFThe author's personal and FBpagesA fascinating article on Laura Hillenbrand from Smithsonian MagazineJuly 3, 2014 - Zamperini passes, the NY Times obit!121!Laura Hillenbrand tells us the extraordinary story of Louis Zamperini, who participated in the Berlin Olympics, worked as an air corp, a bombardier in the Pacific after the Pearl Harbor attack, POW after the Japanese captured him. 
What I learned from this book 

1)The importance of dignity in our life. 
This book shows us the importance of dignity in our life. The author says that maintaining dignity is the real coup that will help a person survive even in the toughest conditions. ""Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it.""  
2) Why is it said that forgiveness is one of the most important qualities a human being should have? 


Forgiveness is one of the vital qualities that a human being should possess. The author is thoroughly discussing the importance of forgiveness in our life in this book. ""The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when they make their tormentors suffer. In seeking the Bird's death to free himself, Louie had chained himself, once again, to his tyrant. During the war, the Bird had been unwilling to let go of Louie; after the war, Louie was unable to let go of the Bird.""  
3) What are the struggles faced by the veterans post war? 
PTSD is a corollary that many war veterans face after the war. Their concept of dignity and self-worth might be shattered due to the extreme physical hardships that they had to endure during the war. The ripple effect of PTSD and its after-effects in personal, family, and social life is devastating. It caused the development of a lot of Psychological, cardiac, neurological abnormalities. Substance abuse, domestic violence, suicides caused due to it is also very high in number.  ""For these men, the central struggle of postwar life was to restore their dignity and find a way to see the world as something other than menacing blackness.""  
My favourite three lines from this book 
 “A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain.”  ""Stories of cannibalism among castaways were so common that British sailors considered the practice of choosing and sacrificing a victim to be an established ""custom of the sea."" To well-fed men on land, the idea of cannibalism has always inspired revulsion. To many sailors who have stood on the threshold of death, lost in the agony and mind-altering effects of starvation, it has seemed a reasonable, even inescapable solution.""    “His conviction that everything happened for a reason, and would come to good, gave him laughing equanimity even in hard times.”   
What could have been better?
It will take some time for some readers to get acclimatized to the author's third-person narrative writing style, and it will be difficult to construe at times due to the cursory writing in some parts of this book.
Rating 
 5/5 This is a must-read book if you love to read biographies.!121!Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption by Laura HillenbrandI wanted to listen to this audiobook in the past and I do read/listen to books based on the experiences of men and women who have been lost overseas during wartime but I saw the movie trailer based on this book and I shied away from the story. Several years later I downloaded the book so that I could listen to it, forgetting about the movie trailer I saw. I'm very glad I did listen to this book but it is one of the most upsetting books I've read. The brutality is unbelievable and the statistics regarding the torture and loss of so many people, including civilians, is so high I can't even get my mind around the numbers. Then there is the amazing resilience of some of the people that survived the worst that man can throw at them. This doesn't take away from all those that didn't survive, these men were going through the unsurvivable and somehow made it out of the other end of their captivity. Still, the damage was done physically, mentally, and emotionally and the road back to living among others at home was a challenge in itself. I already knew of Louis Zamperini because I'm a big fan of track and field old timers. But I also knew of him because I read about the life of William Frederick Harris who spent time in captivity or trying to escape captivity. He became good friends with Zamperini when they were in captivity together and at one point Zamperini tried to nurse Harris back to health when he was beaten into a long term stupor. This story takes us from Zamperini's youth, through his great running feats, including the Olympics where Hitler spoke to him, through his military plane being shot down and surviving endless days on a raft at sea. Then his long captivity and his beatings by captors that singled him out because he stood up to them but also because he'd been an Olympic athlete. So many pieces of Zamperini's story could make up a book, so much happened to Zamperini and those around him. I'm just amazed and inspired by Zamperini and the people who kept on under impossible odds. I can't stop talking about this book to my husband. I still can't watch the movie, it's too much, but I'm so glad I read this book and got to know more of this man and also got to know about many other heroic men that survived captivity and helped others to survive, too.First pub November 16, 2010!121!I've just finished this awesome book, and have since washed the tears from my face. I can't hope to write a coherent review (there are so many good ones already written), so I'll just jot a few thoughts down:* This is why I love non-fiction.* Best book (by far) I've read this year.* Every positive cliche adjective should be applied to this story.* 5 stars isn't enough.* If it was fiction, you wouldn't believe it.* Go buy yourself a cloth hankie, 'cause a kleenex ain't gonna cut it by the last chapter.* Makes me wish my dad was still around so I could ask him about the war.* My next book is going to SUCK in comparison (might as well re-read Breaking Dawn then).* Read this great review by my GR friend Amy S: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...(her review made me want to read this book - great job Amy!)* Perfect book to wrap up on Memorial Day, 2012:To those who served, to those who still serve, to those who made it back, to those who didn't, to those who still suffer in ways we cannot imagine, thank you.Thank you.Thank you.!121!2012 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. I’m in awe. 😲 I cannot imagine living through this amount of torture and torment. It’s truly heartbreaking, the catastrophes of war. 💔 This mans determination to survive was simply amazing. I can see why there was a movie made. Just... wow...!121!Another difficult but powerful historical account of the atrocities of World War II and the power of the human spirit to overcome them. Hillenbrand does a fantastic job of telling this important story that I think it is worth everyone knowing. Again, some of the content is difficult and a bit graphic, but the truth hurts some time and it is worth taking the time and effort to learn about what these brave men in WWII went through to overcome tyranny.Also, I think delving a bit deeper into WWII is worth it as I have learned a lot more about the Pacific side of the conflict than I ever knew before. Seems like most historical (and historical fiction) accounts I have read recently are all about the European conflict. And, it was good to see that there was some humanity among all the inhumanity. If you are not into history, you may not enjoy this, but it is worth giving it a shot for its importance. Overall, an amazing story and an amazingly well done telling of it.!121!Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption, Laura HillenbrandUnbroken is a biography of World War II hero Louis Zamperini, a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash in the Pacific theater, spent 47 days drifting on a raft, and then survived more than two and a half years as a prisoner of war in three brutal Japanese prisoner-of-war camps.تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز شانزدهم ماه نوامبر سال2019میلادیعنوان: ناگسستنی (شکست ناپذیر): داستان جنگ جهانی دوم داستان بقا، تاب آوری (انعطاف پذیری) و رستگاری؛ نویسنده: لائورا هیلنبرند؛ از کتابهای جنگل، سال1398؛ در500ص؛ شابک9780812974492؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21مداستان کتاب زندگینامه ی خلبان نیروی هوایی جنگ جهانی دوم است، که در سال2010میلادی نگاشته شده است؛ شخصیت قهرمان کتاب، «لوئیس زامپرینی» به همره دو تن از همکارانش پس از سقوط بمب افکن خود، چهل و هفت روز تمام را، روی لاشه ی بر جای مانده ی هواپیما، برای زنده ماندن میجنگند، و پس از آن توسط ارتش «ژاپن» به مدت دو سال به اسارت گرفته میشوند؛ بر اساس داستان این کتاب فیلمی با عنوان «شکست ناپذیر» نیز ساخته شده است؛ پس از سقوطی کشنده در جنگ جهانی دوم، «لوئیس زامپرینی» چهل و هفت روز پر از ترس و وحشت را، به همراه دو تن از یاران خویش، روی دو قایق نجات بادی میگذرانند؛ تا اینکه نیروی دریایی «ژاپن» آنها را دستگیر و به یکی از اردوگاه‌های اسرای جنگی اعزام میشوندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 12/02/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 16/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Louie Zamperini and my father, Jim Wilson, were friends, and so I have known the outlines of Zamperini's story my whole life. Somewhere in the photo archives around Moscow, we have a baby photo of me, taken by Zamperini. I am drooling in that picture, something I have contrived not to do with more recent photographs.Though I have been familiar with this story for a long time, Hillenbrand's telling of it is magnificent. This is a book to reinforce everything you knew doctrinally about man's capacity for both depravity and heroism. This was a deeply edifying read. Highly recommended.!121!Holy mackerel. This is the single non-fiction book you ought to put on your read list for 2013. Even if you don’t read it, it’s presence on your shelf will enrich your library.This is a WWII survival story of an American aviator in the Pacific theater. And wow! Louis Zamperini. Zamp!An Italian immigrant with the fastest mile in college track who shook hands with Hitler at the ’36 Olympics, shot down in the pacific, 40+ days in a 2-man raft with 3 people, captured, paraded for propaganda, tortured sadistically on mainland Japan for years by a ‘Jap’ known only as ‘The Bird’ that said “we’re not in Geneva anymore,” rescued at 90 pounds wearing the same 3 year old clothes, followed by years of alcoholic depression, only to be saved by an upstart preacher, Billy Graham, when reminded of the promise he made God in the ocean doldrums with lips so burned and swollen they blocked his nostrils, dedicating his remaining life to working with underprivileged kids.This is the kind of story that causes people to break unexpectedly into chants of U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A. Patriotic outbursts are common at international sporting events, political rallies, displays of military power, and they are also common at pages 85, 130, 165, 201, 232, 255, 287, 303, and 313.Laura Hillenbrand does a wonderful job presenting the timing and pacing of this novel, so that it simply reads itself to you. And there’re plenty of pictures. Just enough information, just the right touch for a feel-good story. Bravo.In 10-15 years America will lose all its primary sources from WWII. You will have no reference, no great-grampa to reveal that epoch to you in lost military jargon and GI colloquialism. Great-grampa, the leatherneck, that, when you were a punk adolescent, sat alone in the warm sunroom with paper-thin skin on the backs of his hands, spots of lentigo, and steaming black coffee in winter. Gut-rot coffee, the way he learned to drink it back then, in a hole, or at predawn prep for takeoff. And so, I’m afraid that younger generations will lose the silken threads that link living history. I’m afraid that kids who think nothing unusual of presidents with no military experience will view WWII simply as another knuckle in history—something to study, fodder for a paper—but no less important than history that piles up each year and must be studied in turn.But WWII was so defining for so many generations, globally, it just yearns not to be forgotten.Due diligence for my star rating:1.

Zamp is still alive!!!For non-service members, it’s a complete mystery the bonds that tie men of military and combat experience. Zamperini is my brother. He and I could talk at the O’Club bar until closing, no matter the 51 years between our service. We could talk about training, flying, targeting the enemy, jumping up during negative G’s so that you hover for an unearthly span of time before settling easy back on the bulkhead. His experience has sweetened my understanding of my own military service. This book has at least extended Zamperini’s legend to the end of my life. Beyond that, spoken history is fact, then parable, then myth. I believe this is the kind of book that military members—especially aviators—must read to carry forward the memorial and self-sacrifice of “duty, honor, country.”If this doesn’t convince you, almost 100,000 people have given the book 4.46 stars in 2 short years. I wonder how many have been in the military?U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A!U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A!!121!If you are wondering if you should read ""Unbroken"", just read it. Even if you don't end up liking it, you just need to read it. Everyone does.Louis Zamperini was an Italian-American Olympic runner whose plane goes down in World War 2, and he and two other men drift on a raft for a long, long time. I don't want to tell you anything else, because I want you to experience it. This books packs a double punch--the story itself is as amazing as Laura Hillenbrand's genius story-telling.Books like this inspire us, they shift our perspectives, they enlighten us, and they scare the *bleep* out of us. Louis stretched the human experience to the very depth and breadth of its ability to survive and lived, scratch that, LIVES to tell about it.!121!Part of my reading of war books and memoirs, this one enlightened to me as to why the Japanese were so reviled by Americans. Fit partners for Hitler indeed.!121!A solid and resounding 3.5 starsThe promotional buzz for this book focuses on Louis Zamperini's survival at sea after a WWII plane crash, and his subsequent ordeal as a POW in Japan. If that's what piqued your interest in the book, I suggest beginning with Chapter 12,(or a few pages before, so you can get the part about the crash). For the first eleven chapters, it's as if Hillenbrand couldn't decide which story she wanted to tell. Instead, she tried to tell them all, and did so poorly. You can quickly scan those chapters for basic background (I did), but you won't be missing much if you just blow right past them. If you're old enough to remember the 1930s and early 1940s, you may enjoy these chapters for the sake of reminiscence. Beginning with Chapter 12, the book becomes more strongly focused. Louie's story sweeps itself along, and the author's presence becomes less noticeable. I can't call the story ""inspiring,"" because I honestly think death would have been preferable to what these men endured. Louie himself stated: ""If I knew I had to go through those experiences again, I'd kill myself."" So, inspiring, no. But AMAZING, yes. Such ingenuity, persistence, and unwillingness to be broken by their captors is impressive and difficult to fathom. They continued to suffer upon return to the U.S., because the mind and body don't forget such traumas. Final Analysis: Astoundingly thorough research, serviceable writing, and, sorry to say, apparently no editorial oversight. From Chapter 12 to the end, it's a four-star offering well worth your time. Louie the man is ten-star material! Read it for sure, just know that my less-than-exceptional rating concerns a need to cut a great deal of material from the book.!121!I'm not sure what I could possibly say that hasn't already been said by countless people who have read and loved this book about a man , courageous beyond words , by an author who captures his heart and mind and the harshest realities of his imprisonment by the Japanese in WW II . It's been a while since I read Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand but I was immediately reminded of what a good writer she is - how she can artfully tell a story which could otherwise be just a compilation of dates and events and bring you to the place and the time where Louie Zamperini lived before and during the war .There's not much more to say except that this is a book that you shouldn't miss. I laughed , cried , was disgusted at the inhumane treatment of Louie and the other POWs but always felt the hope that Louie seemed to carry . I can't believe that I waited so long to read it but I'm so glad that I finally did . It's not one that I will forget . This book is everything the titles reflects and then some .!121!Laura Hillenbrand’s book about Louie Zamperini’s life as an Olympian and later as a POW in Japan gives us powerful reminders that some things in life are real cool and some things just basically suck. Here’s a list that Unbroken brings to mind – things that would be either great (↑) or decidedly not (↓). Having a family that supports you as a child even when you’re a light-fingered, hyperactive little hellion. ↑Becoming enough of a juvenile menace that the police are called to intervene. ↓Having an accomplished older brother who has your back, especially if this brother knows you well enough to divert your energy on to the track. ↑Showing rapid improvement in races, ultimately making the 1936 Olympic team at the age of 19. ↑Gorging yourself on the trans-Atlantic boat ride’s free food that proves all too tempting if you’ve never had a restaurant meal before in your life. Gaining 12 pounds as a result and losing race fitness. ↓Passing numerous runners with a blazing last lap to finish 8th and having Hitler ask to meet you afterwards, remarking, “Ah, the boy with the fast finish.” ↑Stealing a German flag as a souvenir. ↑Setting a collegiate record two years later for the fastest mile, a record that would stand 15 years. Having experts say you’re the likeliest to first break the four minute barrier. ↑Seeing hopes of Olympic glory in 1940 go up in flames with the advent of the war. ↓Joining the Army Air Corps as a bombardier; soon thereafter coming back from a mission with 600 bullet holes in your B-24’s fuselage. ↓On a different plane (a lemon that nobody wanted to fly), having it crash into the ocean due to mechanical problems, killing 8 of the 11 crew members. ↓Finding out after the crash that your life raft has very little in the way of supplies. ↓Living on small raw fish and rainwater for week upon week, aimlessly drifting at sea. ↓Facing a typhoon with 40 foot waves. ↓Facing Japanese bombers strafing you with bullets, missing you (miraculously), but blowing holes in your raft. ↓Sharks. (Even if they don’t come with laser beams, this would suck.) ↓Finding out that the survival manual was correct. With a hard punch in the snout, a shark will usually turn tail. (I’m forcing an interruption to the down-arrow streak.) ↑ Discovering that the land you finally get to after a record 6+ weeks at sea is a Japanese-controlled island. ↓Getting beaten every day by a hyper-sadistic prison guard they call The Bird. Getting singled out as his favorite target. ↓↓Finding out how much starvation, filth, dysentery, and physical abuse a human being can endure. ↓Finally being liberated, going home to a hero’s welcome after you’d been declared dead, and eating mom’s pasta again. ↑Showing signs of PTSD. Drinking to forget. ↓Having your devoted young wife guide you to a spiritual conversion that allows forgiveness and a chance to move on as a motivational speaker. ↑Going strong – still unbroken – into your nineties. ↑Up- and down-arrows apply to Laura Hillenbrand, too. She suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that, for the most part, keeps her in the house and inactive. But she had this to say about her writing, particularly her subjects. “I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically, so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination. And it's just fantastic to be there alongside Louie as he's breaking the NCAA mile record. People at these vigorous moments in their lives - it's my way of living vicariously.”Ups and downs like Everest and Death Valley – a remarkable story, really. And one that was very well-told.!121!Remember when we used to have live TV and stations would air previews for a program they were trying to promote? Have you ever then gone and watched that program only to discover that the preview was kind of misleading?Well, the previews for this book are wicked misleading. Everything about it—the jacket cover, the book description...ok, maybe just the jacket cover and the book description—led me to believe this was a story about a World War II soldier lost at sea. And yes, there is certainly a section of the book that chronicles the experiences of a few Army Air Force personnel who become stranded on a raft in the South Pacific following the crash of their bomber, but the scope of the narrative encompasses much more than that. In fact, the “raft stuff” doesn’t even constitute the most compelling parts of this book. So what gives, Random House? Why you be unnecessarily deceitful?What’s appreciable about Hillenbrand, who by the way suffers from a chronically debilitating disease which often leaves her confined to her home for days at a time (I don’t know why I felt the need to mention that), is her ability to relay a story that depicts a person at what we imagine to be his worst, only to reveal slowly a situation of progressively deepening madness, and she accomplishes this without running out of adjectival modifiers that would otherwise be needed to bring the reader’s jaw closer and closer to the floor. In other words, Hillenbrand knows how to tell a story, and this book, a biography of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini, which focuses on his life in a Japanese POW camp, is a prime example.!121!Wow. Amazing story, and well told - kept me up late at night! Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it's inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war.One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I've seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn't know much about how Japan had treated their POW's. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW's. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.!121!Unbroken is an amazing survival story, but this book is also so grim that it took me five years to finish it.I had loved Hillenbrand's previous work, Seabiscuit, and had bought a copy of Unbroken back in 2010 as soon as it was released. I started reading it, and admired the writing, but the more I learned about what Louis Zamperini suffered during World War II, the less I wanted to read the book. I mean, here was an Olympic athlete who served as a bombardier during the war. His plane crashed while on a rescue mission, and he was stranded in the Pacific Ocean for 47 days. Only two of his crew mates survived the crash, and they had to battle hunger and dehydration, and fight off sharks while in that tiny raft. SHARKS! And then he was picked up by the Japanese and became a prisoner of war. For two years, he was tortured and starved and abused and enslaved. This story is beyond depressing, you guys. And so, the book gathered dust on my shelf, my original bookmark still in the pages. I decided to finally pick it up again after seeing the movie (which is also grim). Since I'm years late to this discussion, all I can say is that the writing and reporting are excellent, and this truly is an incredible story of resilience, survival and forgiveness. I especially liked that Hillenbrand didn't end the story when Zamperini was released from the POW camp; instead, she continued to follow what happened to the men, and even to the Japanese prison guards, some of whom were prosecuted as war criminals. Zamperini ended up living a long and full life, and his story is inspiring. Highly recommended for fans of history and survival stories. Hillenbrand is a remarkable writer, and whenever her next book comes out, I'll immediately order that, too. I just hope it's a more joyful subject.Favorite Quotes""From earliest childhood, Louie had regarded every limitation placed on him as a challenge to his wits, his resourcefulness, and his determination to rebel. The result had been a mutinous youth. As maddening as his exploits had been for his parents and his town, Louie's success in carrying them off had given him the conviction that he could think his way around any boundary. Now, as he was cast into extremity, despair and death became the focus of his defiance. The same attributes that made him the boy terror of Torrence were keeping him alive in the greatest struggle of his life.""""Few societies treasured dignity, and feared humiliation, as did the Japanese, for whom a loss of honor could merit suicide. This is likely one of the reasons why Japanese soldiers in World War II debased their prisoners with such zeal, seeking to take from them that which was most painful and destructive to lose. On Kwajalein, Louie and Phil learned a dark truth known to the doomed in Hitler's death campus, the slaves of the American South, and a hundred other generations of betrayed people. Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it. The loss of it can carry a man off as surely as thirst, hunger, exposure, and asphyxiation, and with greater cruelty. In places like Kwajalein, degradation could be as lethal as a bullet.""!121!It took me a year (rather, 11 months exactly) to listen to this audio... I started the first half while I was painting last year and never got the opportunity to finish it. Months later, when I had it on my phone, I continued listening to it but got bored. B-9 and B-12 planes sadly did not interest. Nor the details on his military service. I honestly know nothing about planes, never been in one even, so the technical part bored me. A lot. Last week I finally made enough progress and reached the ocean part, the story improved considerably. I listened to the audio at every chance I had and finished it rather quickly. I honestly didn't know who Louis was before starting this book. Back in spring, my dad was watching a movie on tv.. I was watching snippets with him and then wow it's so similar to the book.. WAIT what. Yeah, that's how I discovered it's the same Unbroken directed by Angelina Jolie. And Louis is going to get captured by the Japs. You see, I had the audiobook on my laptop and only knew it's a non-fic biography. It was only last week, when I became invested in the story again, that I googled some things about the book (other than the general google page) and yes I did read some spoilers but are is there a spoiler in a biography? Well if I didn't know the story.. I think yes. I couldn't help it, I wanted to know if Allen will survive too. Aside from the military part, I loved the story and how it was told. from the beginning to the very last page. It's really beautiful and heartbreaking. This isn't a review, this is just me telling you that this is a well-written story, it makes a good audiobook, the narrator did a good job, the story is popular for a reason, and the book deserves recognition. If you like reading about WWII stories read it. The only difference is that the author did not have to make up the tragedies and hardships that Louis went through as an athlete, the life on the raft, the horrors of the war, the life after the war...!121!This is a inspiring and educational read. It’s one of those books that you gasp out load while reading it as the horrors of war really come to the forefront in this book. This is a story of five parts and I really enjoyed the first three parts. Part one deals with the protagonist Louis Zamperini's childhood and running career and I really enjoyed this introduction to Louis as I felt I really understood this man and knew how he survived the horrors of war and the physiological and physical pain he endured. I loved the use of photographs in this book and how the author placed them randomly on pages and not in the middle of the book which you find so much in a lot of Biography’s , I am interested in wartime aeroplanes and recently went on a visit to the Intrepid in New York and therefore really connected with this book because of the fantastic information on the aeroplanes and the air force and the amazing research that went into this book. Part 4 of the book was bit of a letdown for me only in the sense that I found it quite repetitive and very dragged and at times I found myself losing interest in the story but however the pace picked up in the last part of the novel. This is a book where you really see the full horrors of war on all sides and what these soldiers and their families went through and the strength and courage they showed. A tale of unbelievable endurance, hardship and heroism this book is not only an education but a wonderful read and a book that you ponder long after you have read it. I would have rated this book 3.5 if possible because of the 4th part which I found dragged on for too long but am upping to 4 stars because this book deserves more than 3 stars.!121!A true tale of human resilience so unbelievable that you would think it was a novel. But Louis Zamperini did it and Hillenbrand chronicles that harrowing journey in a way only she can.!121!I cannot possible do justice to this amazing history of one man's journey through the hell of Japanese POW camps in WWII and the aftermath of those horrors. The author pulls no punches regarding the man's experiences which makes the book sometimes difficult to read.Louis Zamperini was a US Olympic runner who joined the Air Corps when WWII broke out and was a bombardier when shot down in the middle of the Pacific. He and a few others were lucky enough to inflate a raft and began floating in unknown waters, surrounded by sharks. They drifted for 47 days and the men began dying, leaving only Louis and one other flyer still alive. They finally ended up on an island held by the Japanese and the ordeal began.Louis was moved to three different POW camps and how he lived through some of the punishments were unbelievable. In particular, one guard, known as The Bird who was a raving psychopath, picked out Louis for ""special"" treatment which I will not repeat here.(It should be noted that of the 34,648 American prisoners of the Japanese, more than 37% died).The dropping of the atomic bomb ended the war, the guards fled the camps, and Louis survived. He returned to the US a broken man with what now is called PTSD. He became a violent alcoholic, haunted by the thoughts and hallucinations of The Bird and it appeared that his life was over. Then something happened that changed all that. The ending of the book is uplifting and Louis lived on to carry the torch in the 1984 Olympics.I highly recommend this book but the reader should be aware that it is very graphic and emotional.!121!The difference between this and every other depressing and horrific account of World War II is the very personal focus on Louis Zamperini. The telling of his life from a troubled yet spirited young boy, to a famous athlete, to a soldier on the brink of death, to a prisoner in a Japanese POW camp, takes you very deep inside this dark time of history. The horrors feel closer, more real, and the pages demand to be turned.So sad. So powerful.!121!All the cheesy, tired words people use to review books seem to apply to this book: remarkable, intense, striking, exceptional. I hate to use them, but all of them are relevant in regard to this work. I even could use that silly phrase, ""I couldn't put it down."" Literally, yes, I could put it down, but I didn't want to; it was difficult to walk away from. I looked forward to picking it up again and continuing on with the story of prisoner of war Louis Zamperini. Hillenbrand is also the author of Seabiscuit, so I was a bit skeptical of her writing about a WWII POW. I had no doubts she could write well, as Seabiscuit is one of my favorite reads, ever. Yet, a feel-good story about a horse is a different animal than a story of the brutal realities of a prisoner of war. Could she write about the horrors of war without doing a disservice to the harsh truths of battle? The answer is yes. She clearly spent a great deal of time researching his life, the lives of the people he fought with (and against), the battles he fought, the equipment they used. The book is intelligent and she writes with such depth. While some books on war are understandably painful to read, her talent as a writer makes this book a bit more palatable. I do not mean to imply that she demeans or degrades what he endures, she does not, but she seems to know exactly when the reader needs to back away from the horror. With great mastery she will take the reader from the horrors of POW camp to the heartache of the families at home.  While I was skeptical, I had to give the book a shot. For starters, I love the period of time she writes about. (I remain convinced I was born in the wrong time - should have been a child of the 40's/50's or a flapper in the roaring 20's.) Also, I love books on WWII. The clincher for me is that Louie was an Olympian, a runner. While my running days are long gone (and certainly never reached the heights Louie did) there's a bond of sorts there. We meet Louis as a kid growing up in Torrance, California. He's a bit mischievous and well onto his way of becoming a teenaged hoodlum and then a good for nothing adult. He has an epiphany of sorts and gets on the straight and narrow. Guided by his brother, he begins running for his high school track team. While it's not easy at first, after some training, Louis discovers he has some speed. He continues his running career at USC, well on his way to that impossible, elsusive four minute mile and qualifies to run in the Olympics in Berlin. I found myself swept away, absolutely enthralled by the thrill of his races, his trip across the Atlantic, his meeting with Hitler.  Shortly after his return, the war reaches a fever pitch and Louie signs up to serve. He ends up in the United States Air Force as a bombardier. So many incredible stories of close calls of near crashes or of running out of fuel over the shark infested Pacific. During one battle, their B-24 is hit 594 times AND ALL BUT ONE of the crew survive. Eventually, Louie's luck runs out and during a rescue mission in an ill-equipped plane, they crash into the ocean. He survives with a few other men on rafts for 47 days. They fight hunger, thirst, aggressive sharks; they dodge bullets from Japanese pilots. Rescue comes in the form of the Japanese Navy. So begins a long stay in and out of POW camps. He somehow survives unspeakable tortures and after years in captivity, he is free. While the war may have ended for the word, it continues to rage in Louie's psyche. Freed from his cell, his mind becomes his new tormentor, disturbing his thoughts and sleep with hellish flashbacks and dreams. He meets a woman, falls in love and gets married, yet the war haunts him and a cloud of misery hangs over his marriage. He resolves to return to Japan, find ""The Bird,"" the tyrant who tortured him, and kill him. At this stage in the story, he's ugly and unlikable (though the reader understands why). Drinking too much, he becomes abusive. His wife talks him into going to see Billy Graham speak. He walks out one night. Another night he goes and is converted to Christian life. Normally, the cynic in me would moan and groan, or maybe put the book aside for fear of it getting preachy... but it is what it is. Louie finds peace and forgiveness. He no longer is haunted by bad dreams or the desire to find and kill his Japanese tormentor. Religion frees him from hate and he becomes a model husband, father and citizen. The story of Louis Zamperini is, if I may use another overused phrase, ""A MUST READ"".You won't regret it.!121!""I'm loving this book. I would love to just breeze through it but there is so much information. I'm only on page 28 but I'm listening to an audio book at the same time. I'm almost don't with that. Anyway, this book is a must read. Very well written !""""I'm reading this book slower than I do some. I want to absorb everything. My Father, Uncle and Father in law went through this. I'm sad because of the conditions they had to deal with but also proud beyond words. This is a must read book""I finished reading this book last night. It was one of the most memorable books I have read in some time. I didn't care much for History in school, but I was drawn to this one. It amazes me what our soldiers went through and how much we have to be proud of. I would give this more stars if I could. I highly recommend this book.!121!Powerful. Riveting. Beautiful. Probably the best book I have read this year. ""Unbroken"" was our book club choice for the month, and I picked it up somewhat reluctantly. It seemed awfully big and I worried it would be too slow and too depressing. How glad I am that it was chosen! I am going to buy a permanent copy to keep and maybe one for my Dad for Christmas. The book follows the life of Louis Zamperini, a troubled youth turned Olympic runner. He is preparing for the next Olympic games when Pearl Harbor arrives and the country is thrown into war. Louie becomes a reluctant bombardier on a B-24 Liberator. It follows his time as an active soldier, his unfortunate crash, dealing with sharks for weeks on end and no food or water, a horrifying internment in a Japanese POW camp, and his journey home seeking healing and redemption. I am leaving out spoiler after spoiler, giving as little information as possible so as not to ruin anything. But what a life!And what a writer Laura Hillenbrand is. Here is a woman who struggles with severe chronic fatigue and yet was able to slowly produce this incredible work. I have read much non-fiction, I have read WW2 books, Holocaust books, etc etc, but never have I felt so sucked into someone's life. I felt what Louie felt. As his plane is going down over the Pacific and he and his crewmates stare at each other in horror, I truly felt that horror. I caught myself breathing fast with my heart banging against my chest. Again and again I felt like I was there, living it with them. I will also say that Hillenbrand strikes such an important balance--she lays out the gravity of the situation without tipping into graphic unnecessary shock value. There were many times I could hardly stop turning the pages. Amazing that it is a true story.The ending of the book deals so much with forgiveness and redemption. Louis has an understandably difficult time rejoining society at the close of the war. I could not help but compare my own Grandfather, who saw such terrible things in the Pacific theater and turned to alcohol to try to deal with the pain once he came home. I closed the book inspired, hopeful, and touched by his life and choices. I encourage anyone to read this important story.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']"
Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (Hardcover),Cheryl Strayed,4.06,792137,2012,"An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here.At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State — and she would do it alone.Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.","EDIT 4/4/2014: I changed this from two stars to one, because I realized that it's been about two years since I read this book and I still get ragey and fist-shakey just thinking about how much it sucked. So, bonus star deducted. This book sucks on wheels. Read on for more...Okay. I gave myself plenty of time to cool off before writing this review, because man, was I ever pissed at this book by the time I finished reading it. And I really wanted to love it! I'm a backpacker, and I've often fantasized about doing the PCT solo (a pretty stupid idea for anybody who's not much more experienced than I am.) I was excited about a memoir of one woman's experience on the trail. I dug into this book eagerly, but within a few chapters my enthusiasm began to deflate, and by the end I was basically doing this at every other paragraph:After some cooling-off time, I gave it what I feel is a very generous two stars. That bonus star is for the first couple of chapters, which do in fact pull a person in, and which do share some impressive openness on the author's part. I was particularly impressed with her ability to share her weird dreams about killing her mother, which were raw and real and touching and disturbing. Also, the scene where she recalls how  the horse is ""put down"" was particularly affecting. Otherwise, this book just doesn't have all that much to offer. Cheryl Strayed's life doesn't, so far, have an unusual amount of sadness or tragedy or inspiring moments -- the kind of things that make for good memoir reading. Or if her life does contain those things, she's not a good enough writer to make the reader feel it. Brief rundown: Strayed lost a loving parent with whom she had a great relationship, and had a very difficult time accepting that loss. Not particularly different from the experiences of many people I've met. As a result of her grief, she lost all impulse control and sabotaged her marriage to a really wonderful man, then started using heroin. Okay, that's a little more interesting, but unfortunately the full impact of these momentous choices is lost in an unblazed forest of vague, unremarkable prose and confused chronology, making it hard to give a damn. At the nadir of her downward spiral, she hears about the PCT and just decides to hike it, which is not surprising, I guess, since she's proudly established that she suffers from a total lack of impulse control (a condition she never really seems to try to correct throughout the course of the book.) So hike it she does, all unprepared, derping off into the wilderness, as is par for the course, apparently. She can't even be assed to read the essential (and very short, I might add) book Staying Found: The Complete Map and Compass Handbook, an absolute essential for anybody who determines to walk off into the wilderness and survive by whatever she can carry on her back. Oh, she bothered to buy the book, but she neglected to read even a page of it on the flight from Minnesota or wherever she's from to southern California, although she brought it on board the plane intending to educate herself BEFORE she began her blissed-out hippie walkabout. But I guess, hey, free peanuts and a bad Adam Sandler movie, so....If you're getting the impression from the review that this memoir fails mostly because Strayed just doesn't make herself a very sympathetic character, you're getting the right idea. But it gets worse. Once she actually gets the high of hiking (under the weight of a pack HALF HER BODY WEIGHT, for god's sake) the book becomes Mary Sue Goes on a Nature Walk.Everybody -- yes, literally everybody except the gay guy and a couple of women wants to have sex with her. She is that irresistible, all hairy and smelling like a sasquatch and hobbling from miles of carrying half her body weight. All the men she meets eye her appraisingly. Most of them hit on her and ask her out for dinner and drinks (wait...dinner and drinks on the Pacific Crest Trail? Yes, more on that later.) One of them actually does seduce her with the erotic power of his Wilco t-shirt. But the one message she clearly wants you to take away from her allegedly inspiring story of a complete personal transformation on the PCT is that the author is preternaturally sexy, and virtually nothing with a penis can resist her. Strayed's relentless hotness actually becomes such a prevalent theme that I began laughing out loud each time she described yet another man expressing his interest in her hot hiker self. I laughed a lot, O Reader. I laughed a lot.Don't worry; those people she met who didn't want to stick their trekking poles into her worshiped her for other reasons. Every single person she met except for some Totally Grumpy Old Camp Hosts and a couple creepy hunters (who still wanted to have sex with her) couldn't stop telling her how amazing and wonderful she was for hiking the PCT alone. Without any knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness. Everyone said things to reinforce her belief that she was a ""badass motherfucking Amazonian queen."" Hooray! The world is your oyster, 'cause that's all the world is!How did she meet so many people hiking one of the least-trammeled of the world-famous trails on the continent? Well, Strayed actually didn't hike all that much of the trail. She started well north of the Mexican border and had to take a Greyhound around most of the High Sierras, because it was socked in that year and she was unprepared for snow hiking, as she was for most other contingencies. (She got rid of her ice axe after crossing one small snowfield, figuring she wouldn't need it again, y'know, where the elevation got higher. Jesus Christ. Not that she really knew how to use an ice axe anyway.) Her intent was to do only the California stretch, not the entire trail, though she did extend the trip through Oregon after she found out about the impassability of the trail (another thing she should have checked on before she started walking.) So she motored through a good 400+ miles of her ""hike,"" and left the trail for various reasons at various points to hitch-hike instead. Thus, she ended up with a lot of non-hiker people in a lot of non-hiking situations, making this more a memoir of disjointed hippie travel-by-any-means than a memoir of HIKING THE EFFING PCT, as all bookbuyers were led to believe.The parts of the book that actually DID take place on the Trail were interrupted by flashbacks to her life with her mother or the destruction of her marriage or her experimentation with heroin or the fallout from these events. So much so, as soon as she began actually talking about the Trail again, I knew to brace myself for yet another forced emotional flashback to the ordinary tragedy of Strayed's typical American life. Now, in spite of the choking Mary Sueism of the author's self-depiction, I could forgive her utter dumbness in wandering onto the PCT unprepared if she actually learned anything about what a bad idea it is to wander into the wilderness unprepared. If her unpreparedness for the PCT taught her how to be a better person, more aware, more focused, more capable, more responsible, more honest about herself, GREAT. Bring on the stupidity. I like a good redemption tale. But it didn't. It didn't! If it did, those passages were lost in editing, or were never written at all. The book's big climax involves Strayed eating a peach in a grove of azaleas, and it's all very pretty and a deer walks into the clearing, and she realizes that it's totally okay to be who she is. And yeah, it's totally okay to be who you are if you're good with that, but she sets up her personal tragedies as a) being unable to cope with loss, b) intentionally destroying her relationship with a very good man, c) doing potentially deadly drugs, d) lacking all impulse control, and the big take-away lesson from her experience on the PCT is...don't ever change? What? The thing she learned from this experience was that it's just fine to fuck up other people's lives, because now she's A-Okay with herself?Come on!But even that...even that I could forgive if the writing were good. I will forgive anything for gorgeous writing. My favorite book of all time is Lolita, and I can forgive the existence of a fictional character like Humbert Humbert because, damn, have you ever read Lolita? (Strayed has, at least once, and apparently learned nothing about the value of lovely writing.) But the writing in Wild is, if you will forgive the pun, pedestrian at best. I suppose it's serviceable enough for a general memoir of an American woman having a typical American experience of loss and confusion and coming to accept her past. But for describing nature? Ugh. I wasn't expecting ""Annie Dillard hefts a Kelty"" from this book, but one would think that a book which alleges to focus on the great transforming power wilderness would at least give a little time or effort to, you know, wilderness. Miles and miles of trail are dismissed in the tritest and most cliche of short sentences, and as far as describing action, Strayed often resorts to such apprentice work as ""we kissed and kissed and kissed""; ""I walked and walked and walked""; ""I cried and cried and cried."" I yawned and yawned and yawned. I raged and raged and raged. The most vivid scene of actual trail action I can recall is where she falls asleep beside a muddy tarn and wakes to the feel of frogs hopping all over her body. The rest of the prose fell utterly flat, particularly in scenes involving nature. What a crashing disappointment. And what a rip-off, since readers are buying this book expecting to read about the experience of walking the PCT. And there is virtually none of that here.It's no surprise to me that this book was selected for Oprah's Book Club (2.0, no less!) Oprah's selections have become, over the years, increasingly vapid and serving only the ""rah-rah, you go girl"" branding of the Club. I remember, long ago in a distant past, when she actually chose books that had good writing and fascinating characters. I should have been warned off by the fact that this book was picked, but I wanted so, so badly to read a well-written memoir about the enchantment of backpacking, about the way the strife and the loneliness and the rawness of nature pull the packer into another realm of existence, where life is fragile and valuable, where the sky and the earth and the line of the trail itself live, and by turns cradle and sustain the hiker and try and reject her. Instead, I got ""gee, my feet hurt."" The great American memoir of the PCT still remains to be written. I'm sad that it's not already here, that I don't get to read it. I'm elated that maybe I'll yet have the chance to accomplish what this book didn't accomplish. Maybe I'll get a chance to write it. I'm already planning my own trip from Mexico to Canada. (Not solo, though. That's just dumb.) Who knows.!121!3.5 starsWhat kind of dimwit would decide to backpack the Pacific Crest Trail alone with zero backpacking experience? Apparently the same kind of dimwit who would try heroin just because the stranger she spent the night with happens to need a fix.If you can tolerate essence of dingbat and overlook her lousy choices and even lousier excuses for those choices, this is actually an enjoyable read. You have to roll your eyes a lot while working to the point where she hits the trail, but after that it's quite engaging. I admire her tenacity in finishing what she started, given her cluelessness about backpacking that led to serious mistakes and potentially dangerous miscalculations. If you've never backpacked before, use this as a cautionary tale rather than an excuse to be a ditz. Many people with more backpacking savvy than Cheryl have lost their lives through poor planning or just bad luck. The thing that saves this book is that Cheryl writes well. If I can say without unkindness that there's a certain charm in her idiocy, this is what makes her story worth reading. And if you have any backpacking stories of your own, you'll connect with so many of the little things that define the worldwide community of backpackers.!121!I have read a great many criticisms of this book by people who either expected it to be solely about the PCT itself, or were offended by the author's use of coarse language and discussion of her sexual proclivities. And that's fine; all of those readers were obviously seeking something other than what this book had to provide. Myself, I enjoyed it from cover to cover. A longtime lover of the PCT, I already know about the trail from end to end. I was more interested in how the author used a rather spontaneous journey along the trail to help herself face demons and come to grips with her mother's death. There are moments where her emotions are so clearly spelled out on the page, and then there are times where you have to read between the lines. But every step of the way you're alongside her, watching as she learns to accept, to embrace, to let go, and how the PCT weaves through that.This is a book I will most definitely read multiple times over the years. I almost regret buying it in Kindle format because I can think of at least five people I'd love to loan it to and demand they read it immediately.!121!I finished this book a couple of days ago, and have not been able to get it out of my mind. I was happily coming to Goodreads to give my glowing review, but was pretty annoyed at a few of the recent reviews, so I wanted to address that first. The bravery and honesty that flowed from those pages touched me deep into my soul, and to see her described as dimwitted and self absorbed is insulting to the author and to those of us who were moved by her story. If you want to read about a well planned trip by a prepared hiker who has no issues, go and buy a guide book about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. I'm sure you'll find it very informative.'Wild' is a beautifully descriptive story about loss, pain, nearly giving up, and pushing on. I felt like I was right there next to Cheryl, my pack so heavy, my feet bleeding and sore, filthy, hungry and lonely. I couldn't believe she kept going, but also would have been crushed if she hadn't. I loved every moment of this book and am just blown away by the author's audacity and courage. I will probably never be able to go three months in the wild, but I sure loved living vicariously through Cheryl in her 'Wild.'!121!A self-absorbed, ill-prepared woman, 26 years old, leaves her husband (a decent guy) for no good reason, mucks her life up even further with drugs and reckless sex, then engages in some vacuous navel-gazing on the Pacific Crest Trail. As a woman hiking alone she gets all kinds of special treatment and help from fellow hikers. She loses a few pounds, gets some muscles and some sun-bleached hair and calls her work done.!121!Alternate title: How to be a Compete Idiot: Hiking Edition Cheryl goes off on a bender shortly after her mother passes. She ruins her marriage with repeated adultery and ultimately becoming a knocked-up druggie.  Then she aborts the kid and goes hiking. Yes, you read that right.She gets on the Pacific Crest Trail as a way to find herself. By getting lost. Oh the irony. Many, many inspirational quotes have been posted and shared throughout the web thus I will share the two that stood out to me most:The first one is found during her mother's stay in the hospital and requests for morphine from the male nurse.
Sometimes he gave it to her without a word and sometimes he said no in a voice as soft as his penis
Frequently, Cheryl paused the narrative to admire masculine men that she met on the trail or remembered screwing with while married to her husband. This nurse had the unfortunate fashion choice to wear scrubs a little too tight while he was tending her mother (on her death bed). It felt so wrong on so many levelsThe other quote that stood out to me was during a female-empowerment moment. During which she recalls the control she has over men, despite being dirty, bedraggled and stinky. She is a woman.
When i was a child of eleven and I felt that prickly rush of power when grown men would turn their heads to look at me, or whisper, or say, ""hey pretty baby,"" just loudly enough that I could hear. 

Why. Just. Why.
 She's constantly getting lost, never has the right gear and always is in pain...I wanted to shake her. So much. Despite going into gory detail about losing her toenails, developing welts and bruises, she plays off being extremely ill-prepared and dumb by jokingly calling herself:
A big fat idiot
This book tried to make her journey into a positive experience by showing just how much everyone admired and appreciated the work she put into hiking. It was ridiculous. They all treated her kindly - like a badass princess. *coughcough* Mary Sue I'm glad I read this solely so I could squash my curiosity.Audiobook CommentsShe did not narrate her own autobiography.

It would take whatever it wanted and it would never give it back.”
Wild is easily one of the best memoirs I've ever read. For two main reasons.1) It is extremely well-written. This book doesn't have that feeling which non-fiction books often give me - a feeling that I'm stuck in the dreary real world and that I should have read some exciting fiction instead. It reads like a novel. A novel about grief, and youth, and adventure. It's full of memorable characters, drawn so vividly by the author. And it proves that true stories can be no less compelling than the most creative fantasy.2) Strayed captures the emotions of a young woman who has lost her anchor in life so very well. It's one thing to feel a certain way at times in your life, but it's another thing entirely to be able to find the words to accurately portray how that felt to others.Her story is brimming with raw, visceral emotion. Perhaps it is made more poignant to me because I have a somewhat similar relationship with my mum and the thought of losing her is not only unbearable, but completely beyond my comprehension - how can I possibly exist in a world where she doesn't? She and her love are the single reliable constants I've had throughout my life.But beyond that, my mother - like Cheryl's - has made me and my siblings the centre of her entire life and purpose. She lives and breathes for us. She has made mistakes and we have had fights. Angry, raging fights that would easily have destroyed a weaker bond. And yet, I have never been more certain of anything than her unconditional love and her desire for my happiness.Strayed's shared emotions pulled out some deep ones of my own.Beyond the emotional pull of the novel, it is an adventure story that takes us through all the highs and lows of the wilderness. Interspersed with little anecdotes about the author's life before hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, it shows everything that Strayed faces in her struggle to sort her life out. Everything from bears, rattlesnakes and other people, to dehydration, destroyed feet and the realization that she had not planned her trip very well.Many times she considers giving up, and yet she pushes on. It's uplifting, and yet the messages avoid being heavy-handed because they are surrounded by so much story and adventure. An easy-to-read, enjoyable book, that is the perfect balance of sadness and hope.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store!121!In some reviews, Strayed has been criticized for a number of things. Unpreparedness for the Pacific Crest Trail, risky decisions and miscalculations, as well as reckless living - poor choices in coping with a broken life. Her real father was unstable, abusive and essentially absent. Her mother was quirky. She couldn't provide the basic material comforts of the middle class. On the other hand, her unconventional behaviors are exactly what gave Cheryl her independent, survivor spirit. Her mother died in her mid-forties and the threads of what little family Cheryl had disintegrated. Married to a perfectly good man, but wed very young, in her grief, she eventually resorted to heroine abuse and promiscuity. I think those readers are missing the point. This is not a how-to book. Although there are some brief informative sections about the history and development of the PCT, as well as fleeting references to equipment. It is not a back to nature book. She writes picturesque but unsentimental descriptions. It is not a self-help book. She's not espousing any means to self discovery. It is a eloquent story of how one rather mixed up young woman used this journey. Alone, she is able to dig deep into her past and her fears. There comes a point in everyone's life when we have to forgive our own mistakes and accept how they define us. The struggles along the trail gave her the strength and clarity to face who she really is and what she is capable of. It resonated with me. After having taken a road trip in the mid 70's, from Minneapolis, to Whitehorse Yukon Territories, back through Edmonton, across the Rockies to Vancouver and down Route 1 to San Diego before going home. The experiences most definitely frame who I am.!121!So far, a great read. It's Eat, Pray, Love without all the whining.!121!Re-Read on Audio 2017 ~ Just going to tweek my old review as I still feel the same about the book and movie. ** 2015 ** Review I just recently watched the movie ""Wild."" I have actually watched the movie several times now. When I saw that it was based on a true story I immediately logged onto Amazon and ordered the book. I am so glad I did as this is a wonderful book. Of course there are different things in the book than in the movie, but that just made it better, it was liked I was learning more about Cheryl's life. I have always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail when I would see the signs to it not far from where I live. But I got sick and that never happened. If you get a thought to try something, don't wait, DO IT, because you never know what is going to happen. I never even knew anything about the PCT. I want to get books on it and read about it. I want to see in a book the actual places that Cheryl was in the book. I want to recognize some of the places. I can't state enough how much I loved the book. It was so moving and hard. I can't imagine the things she went through, what anyone that hikes like that goes through. I love hiking but this is beyond hiking in my opinion. Cheryl found out a lot of things about herself while on the trail. She met a lot of nice people along the way as well. Sometimes a person's life is so sad and seems so horrible and then something wonderful comes along. Cheryl eventually found that in her life and I'm happy for her. I recommend this book to anyone that loves hiking, to anyone that loves stories about finding yourself, to anyone that loves stories about the hardships of life. And Cheryl made it. ♥Totally awesome!MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List!121!This author is the columnist who writes Dear Sugar? Sugar is wise and funny and real. I found this book to be incredibly self indulgent. The first 100 pages was the author whinging about how her mother died when she was 22, and how she would never recover, never stop crying, never stop lashing out at the people around her. Instead of focusing on how lucky she was to have ever had a mother who poured an infinite amount of unconditional love into her, she instead imploded, lost in her own self indulgence. She also whinged about how her stepfather moved on, got married to a new woman, and forgot about her. Instead of being simply grateful that she had ever had such warmth, kindness and compassion at all, she instead behaves like a spoiled, pampered brat. Instead of being grateful that her exhusband Paul seems like a total saint, she writes about how lonely she is, how sad she is that she destroyed her marriage, etc. She's lucky to have had Paul in her life, luckier that he's willing to stay ""best friends"" with her after her hurtful actions. So, yay then she walks the Pacific Crest Trail, and learns a little about real life and enduring hardship and surviving. I haven't finished the book yet, but given that it was written about a journey that happened in 1995, I'm guessing that between 1995 and 2012, the author has grown up and endured even more, resulting in the wisdom that is Sugar today. Anyways, this book is definitely not for me. I guess I'm more accustomed to grittier and more desperate tales of endurance and transformation.p.s. I did end up finishing the book. And my review remains the same: it's like a 90210 version of the Odyssey. There's no evidence of the pathos or humanity that swelters from the pages of Dear Sugar here.!121!So much baggage. As a backpacker myself, I cringed to read about hoisting a backpack so heavy that she could only strap it on while sitting on the ground. How she managed to balance that pack and not let it accidentally fling her off the Sierras, even after Albert put that bag on a diet, is beyond me. And those tight boots that ate her toenails and mangled her feet into a fine pulp!! If nothing else, those boots end up being a fine advertisement for REI’s amazing customer service. While I’m happy she survived, her early hiking tales scared me. I hope there are no hapless hikers thinking they too can head out as unprepared as her. And it took so long to get to the actual hiking. Like her backpack, there’s so much personal drama to unload. So much grief. Over her mom’s death, over the childhood she didn’t get, over her self-destroyed marriage and other poor life choices. If you’re simply looking for tales of adventure on the PCT, you’re going to be disappointed. The PCT is only the backdrop and therapist to all that personal drama. You slog through overwrought drama more than scenic mountainscapes in this book. Thank heavens, by the end of the trip, she’s unloaded and discarded a lot of the figurative and literal baggage. Backpacking really is magic like that, if the excess weight doesn’t fling you over the edge first.!121!The great American Hispanic philosopher George Santayana loved to tell the story of his macho dad’s last night in the land of the living...Seems the whole household was already reverently hushed, mourning their inevitable loss.But suddenly there cracked the evening sky like thunder, from Santayana père’s chamber, a Jovian Voice:“$@!!! Where’s my blazing DINNER!?!”So know you know where Santayana Junior inherited the genes for the incredible Life Force within him...Well, I think Strayed must have inherited the same gene!WILD, by the simply amazing Cheryl Strayed, is a tale of regaining your strength, dignity, sense of purpose, and all the love in your life that you may have thought you’d lost forever: in other words, a Total Rebirth. Finding your Life Force!Which has happened to me, after my own Long Day’s Journey to the Night of Nothingness. A Total Rebirth.***At work, they termed the downsizing that restarted Cheryl's Journey for me, a move to Excelerate - to excel even while accelerating our pace - to make do independently with our dramatically cut staffs.Thanks to our sensitive senior executives, the firings were few (and came with generous emoluments), Thanks also to our own group leader Gordon Hunter, for letting his amazing brain be guided throughout by his heart!But man, oh man, did my blood pressure skyrocket... and, of course, my bipolar condition played naïve second fiddle to my stress. And that scenario was obvious to my mental health worker.What did he do? He prescribed a massive state-of-the-art tranquilizer. He had no choice. It flatlined my libido. It brought the world - my friends, my gaffes, my unfounded Faith - into unforgivingly sharp focus.But, worst of all, it emasculated my heuristics - those normative benchmarks you need to survive in the world and appear half-normal. I no longer had much clue of what normal was. Yikes. Though, at first encounter, I seemed a positive, industrious soul swimming in paperwork.Something similar happened to Cheryl. She lost it.It must have happened to Jean-Paul Sartre, too, at the time he wrote Nausea - It was the dawning of the Absurd for him, as for me - and he henceforth saw his glass as half-empty (like so many coming-of-agers), while I, being bipolar, saw it as half-full.And half-full, in our disintegrating workplace, was definitely not normal. So, having lost my heuristics in this chemical blitz of the Absurd, I was typecast as a friendly, bumbling pariah. To all who knew me, including those dearest to me. Definitely not myself. So I dig where Cheryl's coming from. She and I were food for the Crows.Privileges were removed. Friends packed up and left. Though I got a ‘posthumous’ medal I was plainly not to be trusted when I retired, burned out as I was.So what did I do when I retired?

With a fairly high average rating, I am in the minority with that vote. At 315 pages, I feel this could have easily been condensed into 1-2 pages. The memoir basically could be summed up like this:My mother died. I am mad at her for this. I hate her for this. I miss her. I love my mother. I have horrible coping skills, those skills primarily being heroin, alcohol, and gratuitous sex with strangers. This caused my divorce. I love my ex-husband. He was wonderful. My mother died. I hate her. I love her. My backpack is heavy. I was unprepared for this trip. My feet hurt. I frequently remove my entire blackened toenail by hand and flick them away. I stink. My mother died. I hate her. I love her. Pretty creek! More gratuitous sex. My ex-husband is so wonderful. My mother died. I am mad at her. I miss her. My backpack is heavy. My feet hurt. I stink. Ahh, mountains. Just flicked another toenail. My backpack is heavy. I was unprepared for this trip. My mother died. Ex-husband is wonderful. Heavy. Hurt. Stink. I ate my mother's cremated remains. Yes, you read that correctly. Crater Lake is so beautiful. Feet hurt. Was not prepared for this trip. Ex-husband is wonderful. Single women hiking have to watch out for bad men. My mother died. Hate and love her. Met more guys, have crushes on them all. Pack is heavy. Feet hurt. I stink. You meet weird people on the trails. I am divorced. My ex-husband is wonderful. Mt. Hood is so pretty. Feet hurt. Flicked another toenail off - only have six intact left! Yay, I made it to my planned end on the trail. This was wild. Sigh, I simply do not understand the hype around this book. For me, it was insignificant and forgettable. The writing is painfully repetitive, simplistic (and not in the amazing, beautiful way) and at times it seems the writer tries to be poetic but ends up leaving the reader scratching their head trying to translate. Allow me to share some examples:“He kissed me hard and I kissed him back harder, like it was the end of an era that had lasted all of my life.” ""In my perception, the world wasn't a graph or formula or an equation. It was a story."" ""I was a pebble. I was a leaf. I was the jagged branch of a tree. I was nothing to them and they were everything to me."" ""I walked through the spider webs, feeling them like magic on my face, pulling them out of my hair."" P.S. Eating a loved one's remains will not ensure that they will remain with you forever. On average, the consumed parts will remain with you for approximately 53 hours before being eliminated from the body via the last stop on the digestive track, but could be as quickly as 33 hours. I recommend a nice, covered container to keep a portion of your loved one's remains as a more effective way of ensuring they will remain with you forever. --------------------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: N/A.First Sentence: The trees were tall, but I was taller, standing above them on a steep mountain slope in northern California.!121!A world that measured two feet wide and 2,663 miles long. A world called the Pacific Crest Trail.

Cheryl's mother- who she was close with, comes down with cancer. She goes through losing her mom very fast. It seemed like one minute was the diagnosis and the next she was gone. She felt like a part of her soul was torn away.The amount she loved us was beyond her reach. It could not be quantified or contained. It was the ten thousand named things in the Tao Te Ching's universe and then ten thousand more. Her love was full-throated and all-encompassing and unadorned.Cheryl was married at the time but she lost herself and started cheating on her husband. She started using drugs. She lost who she thought she was. She decides to hike the Pacific Trail with the thoughts that maybe she would get back that girl she used to be.I have seen several review that slam her for taking off on a trail with an over-packed backpack and little knowledge of what she was doing. I'm not slamming her for that. She grew up in house that didn't have electricity or running water so she thought she was pretty tough. I don't see Bill Bryson getting slammed as much for his book A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. (Which I did love, but he was pretty unprepared also). His book focused more on experiences of the actual hike though and not about just looking at cute guys on the trail and thinking about how horny she was. (Hey, I'm not knocking it-there just should have been more to read about)I have to wonder if some of the hate for this story is because she was a woman setting off into the woods by herself.

There were parts of the book that I just didn't care for either though. She repeats herself a ton. Over and over you hear how tired she is. How her feet hurt. How some of her toenails have come off. Just little mundane tid-bits that she feels needs repeated over and over. Borrrrinng.Then it seems like she is trying to hard to be deep. Little ""quotables"" of her theory of life felt thrown throughout the book and at first I liked them but then it became too much. I felt like she was going for being an all knowing guru and it just ended up irritating the crap out of me.

Then the drug use. I think she was VERY stupid about the drug use. She keeps writing about how she was fine using heroin and that she would have stopped. I don't think she would have if her ex-husband hadn't gotten involved. I mean damn, she shot up in her frigging foot right before heading off into the woods.Stupid.She ate her mom's ashes. Because she wanted her to be a part of her forever. I get that she wants part of her mom, I do. That just kinda freaked me out. But it was supposed to be deep and deep is not my thing.

I don't see how she made it so far with that heavy of a pack or the boots that were that much smaller than she needed either. But I'm going with sorta believing her. Sorta.I feel bad that this book wasn't better for me. This is usually the type of book that I would have loved. I went through a stage where I was sorta outdoorsy. The first hike I did I was horribly prepared for. It was a hike that I later found out was one of the hardest in my area. (Mountains in it named Achin and Pain should have been my first clue) My dumb butt didn't want to move a muscle for a week. Nevermind that panic that I and my hiking companion had that we wouldn't make it to a spot that had water. This is my chubby self on that nightmare hike. (Yes, I throw in personal shit when I want.) 

I will follow up with watching the movie version of this book, because I'm hoping that they cut out some of the repeatedness of the book.

I buddy read this one with TL but she threw this sucker down and said ""to heck with it.""!121!Despite this book’s stellar reviews and much hype it did not seem like one I’d enjoy. A memoir written by a woman who loses her mother and then promptly takes up heroin and cheating on her sweet husband (who she loves very much). She then decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail despite zero hiking/wilderness experience. I figured nothing to relate to here: the loss of a parent, the drugs, the cheating, and any and all hiking/camping/roughing it…these are all completely foreign to me and also things I'd like to avoid. And I was right: there was nothing I related to. Yet my enjoyment of this was not hindered. This is a great memoir. The writing is excellent and I turned the pages quickly, anxious to discover what happened next. It’s even funny at times. The hobo thing is hilarious. Though the book is about her hike she does cover quite a bit of her background/history. The author never feels sorry for herself and takes 100% responsibility for all the shitty decisions she’s made. Thus she is quite likeable even as you’re thinking “you’re an idiot!” It’s amazing she did this hike. I do wonder if she’d done it now instead of 1995 if it would’ve been so desolate. She goes days (weeks?) without seeing another human. I feel like “extreme hiking” or just “extreme outdoorsiness” in general is a lot more popular now. The fact she was a woman, alone, hiking for all those weeks is astounding. A very impressive feat.There are times the narrative gets a little long but I suppose if you spend months alone you’re going to be hard-pressed to fill a whole book. Today my feet hurt and I’m thirsty. Today my feet hurt again. That’d get old. Also, there are a few things she brings up so incessantly (objects, facts) that you’re certain they’re going to reappear and they don’t. Like foreshadowing without the actual follow-through. Anyway, overall a very, very well-written memoir and one that had me engaged from the first age to the last. Highly recommended!!121!she let da intrusive thoughts win🤣💀!121!Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl StrayedAt twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State, and she would do it alone. Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her. Cheryl Strayed is an American writer and podcast host. She has written four books: the novel Torch and the nonfiction books Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, Tiny Beautiful Things and Brave Enough.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه آوریل سال2019میلادیعنوان: وحشی؛ نویسنده: شرل (چریل) استرید ؛ مترجم: میعاد بانکی ؛ ویرایش: مریم سعیدی؛ تهران : ستاک‏‫، چاپ نخست سال1397، در443ص؛ چاپ دوم سال‏‫1397؛ ‬‬در447ص؛ مصور، نقشه، شابک9786008883050؛ عنوان روی جلد وحشی از گمشده تا پیدا شده، در مسیر پاسیفیک کرست؛ موضوع: استرید، چریل، سال‏‫1968میلادی‬ - سفر‌ها - مسیر پسیفیک کرست - سده20مممکن است همه در دوره ای از زندگی خویش خسته شوند؛ از زندگی روزمره، از جایی که در آن زندگی میکنند، از زندگی بدون دلخوشی؛ گاهی اوقات میکوشند، با رفتن به سفر حالشان را بهتر کنند؛ دوباره به زندگی عادیشان بازگردند؛ ولی گاهی اوقات، بعضی از آدمها، به سیم آخر میزنند و به سفری طولانی میروند؛ سفری که ممکن است روزها یا ماهها طول بکشد، یا حتی بازگشتی نداشته باشدداستان زندگی «شرل استرید»، داستانی دل اگیز و واقعی، درباره ی زنی ست، که در آستانه ی فروپاشی، دلش میخواهد، در مسیری طولانی پیاده روی کند، تا خود را پیدا کند؛ سرگذشتنامه «استرید» به اندازه ای دل انگیز بوده، که در سال2014میلادی، فیلمی بر اساس سرگذشتنامه ی ایشان، به کارگردانی «ژان مارک ولی» ساخته شد؛ کتاب به مدت هفت هفته در صدر کتابهای پرفروش «نیویورک تایمز» بوده و به بیش از سی زبان ترجمه شده، و برنده ی بهترین کتاب سرگذشتنامه ی سال2012میلادی، در سایت «گودریدز» شده استاوج هنر «استرید» در این کتاب، بازگو کردن سرگذشت خود، با جزئیاتی جذاب و لمس شدنی است، با صراحت حالات و افکارش را بازگو کرده، و خوانشگر را درگیر وضعیت خویش میکند؛ قلمش به گونه ای است، که حتی تاریکترین بخشهای زندگیش را، خواندنی کرده، گاهی با کلمات بازی میکنند، و این باعث میشود که قلمشان یگانه شود؛ از واژه ی «وایلد» بارها، با معانی گوناگونی سود برده، که این ترفند در زبان فارسی خوشبو نمیشود، گاهی از خودش اصطلاحاتی میسازد که عجیب و غریب است و کمی به درازا میکشد تا به آن عادت کنیدنقل نمونه متن: (سال‌ها طول کشید تا در میان آن همه‌ چیز دوباره خودم را پیدا کنم؛ تا آن زنی شوم که مادرم تربیت کرده بود؛ تا به‌ یاد آورم که چگونه می‌گفت عسلم و نگاه خاصش را در ذهنم تصور کنم؛ می‌خواستم رنج بکشم؛ می‌خواستم رنج بکشم؛ می‌خواستم همه‌ چیز نسبت به چیزی که بودند تغییر کنند؛ لازمه‌ اش جایی دور افتاده بود و من باید راه رهايى از غمم را در آن‌جا پيدا می‌کردم؛ چهار سال، هفت ماه، و سه روز طول کشید، تا اینکار را انجام دهم؛ نمی‌دانستم دارم به کجا می‌روم، تا اینکه به آن‌جا رسیدم؛ جایی به نام: پل خدایان)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 31/03/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!Strayed's ego manages to outsize even the magnificent Pacific Crest Trail. She's a self-absorbed asshole who manages to use her mom's death as an excuse to spread her selfishness over everyone she knows. She survives her partial hike of the PCT only due to the amazing generosity of fellow hikers who are actually competent.Are you wondering if she's pretty? Oh my, yes! Never mind that on the back flap she looks like someone's daffy aunt. Strayed never tires of relating the unending river of compliments she receives about her beauty and sexiness. Her appearance is a constant concern, even when she's on the verge of reaching her goal.Maybe it shouldn't bother me so much that at one point she mentions snorting tar heroin, a task that is impossible due to tar heroin's, well, tarriness. It comes up when she tells of her brief trist with the drug while shacked up with a fellow florid-tongued dipshit in Portland, Oregon – another situation from which she ends up requiring rescue, this time by her generous ex-husband. That obvious lie makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of her tale (except her stunning beauty, of course).She appears to think she's somehow developed spiritually or emotionally by the book's close, but it's unclear how. She seems like just as much of a thoughtless ass as she did on page one.She writes eloquently and there must some truth throughout, for why would someone fabricate a story that makes herself look like such a dick?!121!ترجمهٔ این کتاب تجربهٔ خیلی عجیبی بود؛ با خوندن همون فصل اول، دو کتاب دیگه‌ای رو که توی لیست ترجمه داشتم کنار گذاشتم. همراه‌شدن با شِرِل برام تجربهٔ متفاوتی بود. قلمش خاص بود و البته ترجمه رو کمی برام سخت می‌کرد؛ نویسنده ليسانسش ادبيات انگلیسیِه و اصطلاح‌هایی توى کتاب هست که مخصوص خودشه و فكر كنم يكى از دلايلى كه على‌رغم شهرتش ترجمه نشده همين بوده! ريسك بزرگى كردم به‌هرحال😁 اميدوارم تونسته باشم اون فضاى جذاب و عجيب ذهنش رو منتقل كنم و کمبودهاش رو هم نادیده بگیرید. حدود ۲۰ تا از مصاحبه‌هاش رو دیدم و خوندم و تا حد توانم سعی کردم به سبک نويسنده وفادار باشم و درعین‌حال متن هم روان باشه.گاهى اين‌قدر با شِرِل همراه مى‌شدم كه شب‌ها كابوس مى‌دیدم؛ خودم رو تو بيابون احساس می‌کردم و من هم مار و جونورايى رو كه شِرِل باهاشون مواجه شده بود می‌دیدم. احساس شِرِل به مادرش برای من خیلی قابل‌درک بود. باوجود حماقت‌هاش، دلم برای عشق عجیبی که نسبت به مادرش داشت می‌سوخت؛ عشقى كه واقعا برام جذاب و قشنگه. کتاب تلنگر بزرگیه به افرادی که قدر کسایی رو که اطرافشون هستند نمی‌دونند.خوشحالم که این شانس نصیبم شد و این کتاب رو به فارسی ترجمه کردم. شِرِل به‌قدری روراسته که همه‌ش حین ترجمه از خودم می‌پرسیدم چطور می‌شه یک‌نفر این‌قدر جرئت داشته باشه که حتی خصوصی‌ترین فکرهاش رو بازگو کنه و خجالت نکشه!؟ از قضاوت‌های مردم نترسه! این کتاب برای من در صدر ژانرش و جزو ۵ کتاب دوست‌داشتنی زندگی‌م قرار گرفته. جذاب‌ترین نکته‌ش اینه که سرگذشت‌نامه‌س نه تخیل نویسنده. خوشبختانه از طریق توییتر با نویسنده صحبت کردم و گفتم که کتاب رو ترجمه کردم و گفت خوشحاله که در ایران هم کتابش خونده می‌شه.نمى‌تونم با اطمینان بگم که شما هم به اندازهٔ من دوستش خواهید داشت، چون کتاب سلیقه‌ایه، ولی افرادی که سلیقهٔ من رو می‌شناسند قطعا با خوندن صفحه‌به‌صفحهٔ این کتاب حالِ عجیبی می‌شن....📚📚📚📚📚📚كتاب در نشر سِتاك چاپ شده!121!Ok ok good. Everyone's new favorite book: yes, I loved it too.DO YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING STUPID? During the first half, I wasn't sure how much I liked it. Because I am crazy. Because it is good! It is all good. But it was different, at first, than I expected. I was joking before, that for fans of Sugar (an inevitable readership for this book), there almost needs to be two ratings: one for book-ness, and one for Sugar-ness. By nature, the essays in ""Dear Sugar"" are written in a way that requires them to relate her story to a metaphor, that make her experiences reach through the ordinary to say something about another situation. This writer knows how to pull the honesty of life out of very regular things, the kinds of things that make you feel, ""Why is this getting to me? Everything is fine."" She knows why, she can explain, she can cup you in her palm and show you what the world does.So I was looking for this in the book on page one, greedily. And honestly, to me it wasn't all there. I liked it for sure, but it wasn't tugging inordinately at my heart, just telling me stuff in a really honest way. There is a lot to learn about what she's going through, and that is what you're getting into in the beginning. Then halfway through, something changed. The fox happened and I cried, was one of the things. And I thought, when I read that: there we go, that is it, that is what I've needed from this. It's a breath-catching moment that relates to what she's been writing and means everything to her, and she delivers that everything right on the page, in actually just a few lines.WELL THEN little did I know that immediately next up is Lady The Horse, and I would soon be dead from crying. I… cried so much, that next day. And books don't actually make me do that very often. But here, unfortunately, I started to read that chapter on the subway home from work — normally a PERFECTLY SAFE reading environment — and I knew I was going to be in trouble. I think the most terrible part for me was actually its beginning, when she knew the inevitability of what would happen, and then we all just had to watch it. I got off of the train and couldn't just put my bookmark there, so I stood outside on the sidewalk finishing the section, and then I walked into a park and stood behind a tree in the dark to hide while I cried my brains out.Happily, I came back to life in order to finish the book. And I don't know if it is just the unmistakeable power of that section, but everything after felt different. It all got me. She is writing the necessary symbolism deep, deep inside the story, and it is almost never gone afterward. Partly, her journey affords a lot of its payoff at this point — she never quits learning what she's doing, but the first half is almost all learning, and the second half has her also knowing, and noticing, and reaching.In general, there's a few things going on here. The author is hiking this trail for three months, and the point is that she doesn't know what she is doing. She started to do it because it seemed right and not because she seemed ready. She literally didn't know how to carry everything she had to bring with her. She also literally doesn't know what will be at the end of the path, after the point on the map at the Bridge of the Gods, what then. It's huge, it's all of it huge and right and good.I think the theme I liked most, though, was about identity. A lot is in there, of course, because when she takes this trip she is in a huge amount of transition, and that is basically the point of the whole endeavor. But I was surprised that there is actually a lot of more literal identity crises in the story, not so much of finding where she fits as finding she's not even on the side of the line she thinks she's on. This happens kind of a lot: the hobo mistakes her for a hobo, the journalist mistakes her for a hobo, the hippies mistake her for a hippie. She finds herself so far outside of normal life, both because she's living literally outside and because she happens to be cold broke, and there is so much looking in at the world with inarticulable longing (often for cheeseburgers). Some people get really proud of going off the grid and out of the mainstream when they've had some of the privilege to sacrifice it in the first place, but that's not really Cheryl's motive (this is not Into the Wild, thank god) and she doesn't expect to think of herself that way. I think it makes her feel even more lost on the personal side of her journey, and means that she has even more work to do to make her new life work than she thought.Relatedly, she thinks some interesting thoughts about gender. There's a lot of the basic-feminist ""being a woman alone"" pride, of course. One loses count of how many guys make comments about her hiking the trip alone, often paired with the veiled threat that they would never permit a woman who was ""theirs"" to do so. But what's really interesting are the specific situations she runs into where she has to figure out if she is safe. She writes through every step in her calculations every time she is afraid, and the times she is afraid of men are even more interesting than any of the times she is afraid of wild animals or dangerous terrain. She's inspecting the line across which things can become irrevocable, and they go in both directions. (A bull in both directions, I suppose.)Also, this is silly, but like her, I totally wanted her to get laid on her trip and I was so haaaappy when she did.I'd like to say that that's it, because I think it would be cooler to say so, but the truth is that just like all good fans of anything, I love Cheryl Strayed because she means something to me, me, that I don't think could possibly mean as much to anyone else (though obviously, that's the magic). This is particularly forceful for her writing because she writes about her life, and things about her life and her feelings remind me of very important things about mine. The subjects of her essays often bring this out fiercely, and there is plenty of it present in this book, too. A great deal of the pages I folded down are personal, personal. It feels like a letter in which she's giving, well, advice.She just has such a gift for this. I think we're lucky she knows how to make it a gift for the rest of us, too.!121!Cheryl is dealing with her mother's death badly. In her grief she has a.) not done the final work necessary to get her degree, b.) cheated on her sweet husband with multiple men, c.) as a result of (b) has gotten a divorce, d.) has a kind-of boyfriend named Joe who introduces her to heroin.After all this, Cheryl feels like she needs to get her head right. So she decides to hike the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), which is more than a thousand miles long.She is not a backpacker or an experienced hiker. She makes tons of mistakes along the way, carrying a very heavy pack, losing 6 toenails, meeting (sometimes unfriendly) wildlife, meeting (sometimes unfriendly) people, and finally coming to terms with her mother's death and the loss of her husband (through divorce).This book at times made me laugh out loud, at times it made me feel sad (not cry - I never cry over books), and sometimes frightened me. I really liked all the emotions it made me feel.I was hesitant to read this book, because my friends in real life are split between love it/hate it. However, I ended up landing in the ""love it"" camp.While some people complained that the book was boring and too self-absorbed, I really loved it. She alternates between telling what's happening on the Trail and what happened to her in the past (her mom's death, her family's disbanding, her father's abandonment, her stepfather's abandonment, her divorce, her abortion, her drug use, her mindless affairs with men she has no feelings for, etc.). The trail part is not boring because not only does she describe nature/hiking stuff, but she describes vividly the other hikers she stumbles upon on the way and also friendly (and unfriendly) townfolk on her many stops along the way. I was fascinated and intrigued.I really liked how honest and open she was about her life and the mistakes she made. She laid it all out there: the divorce, which was her fault. Her many affairs. Her drug use. Her failure to get her college degree. It's really hard and painful to put your failures out there in public, and I really admired her for doing that. It certainly made me feel sympathy and empathy for her - she was a human being who was basically good, but flawed.Other people complained about her rather...adventurous...sexuality. However, this didn't bother me at all. It's true that she thought about having sex with every single male she met, regardless of age, race, religion, height, weight, or marital status, but that was fine. I liked that she liked men and that she liked sex. I was happy that she insisted on using a condom when she did have sex. I don't condone her cheating on her husband, but trust me - she's suffered enough for that. And she doesn't have sex with any married men in the book. She tries to blame this attitude she has towards sex on her father (and stepfather, I guess) abandoning her, but I don't really know if that was it. It was clear she just really liked men and also was able to separate sex from love, which isn't possible for everyone. She's young (26) and I feel like she should enjoy herself while she can. So no judgment here on her sexual choices from me. What DOES bother me is her drug use. She just forges joyfully on, la la la, accepting any drugs offered to her by any person in any situation without a thought to the consequences. ""Heroin? Fine. Opium? Sure. La, la, la. Oh, you're just a random man I met in a hick town who lives in your truck and approaches me out of nowhere and the next thing I know I'm gleefully eating opium with you in your truck? La, la, la."" This drove me nuts. She could have gotten really fucked-up and been in serious trouble. She insists the heroin was ""just a phase (of 2 months)"" but if her ex-husband hadn't come along and yanked her out of that situation I believe she'd still be using.Overall, the book was touching, funny, invigorating, and motivating. I highly enjoyed every second reading it, and I know I will re-read it. It has a good re-read quality to it, I think. AND it's available in Spanish as ""Salvaje."" Woo-hoo!...P.S. Update 09/12/2014Also, it's worth noting that this is the only solo female quest adventurer that I have ever read about. While there are dozens of male narratives about striking out on your own and having an adventure for the purposes about learning about life and making discoveries about yourself - this is the only instance I can remember of a woman doing this.This book is a great message to women and girls that they too can strike out on their own and have adventures. I know a lot of women decide to backpack across Europe or travel across the USA and have complained to me about the lack of female narratives that express this desire and express a female's ability to do this without being inevitably raped and murdered.If only for that and nothing else, Cheryl Strayed's narrative has value to me.!121!I loved this memoir so much that I read it twice. When Cheryl Strayed was in her 20s, she decided to hike 1,000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. The wilderness walk was born out of grief — her mother had died suddenly of cancer, and Cheryl was feeling lost. She had been wildly taking drugs and having affairs, which broke up her marriage. She also felt regret over mean things she had said to her mother, and she was angry that her mom had died so young. I was profoundly affected by Cheryl's story. She wrote eloquently about her family and her grief, her adventures on the trail, and what the experience meant to her. Cheryl is a wonderful storyteller — she's funny and warm and clever. I highly recommend this book to those who like outdoor adventures or who appreciate grief memoirs.Favorite Quotes""Now that she was dying, I knew everything. My mother was in me already. Not just the parts of her that I knew, but the parts of her that had come before me, too.""""It hadn't occurred to me that my mother would die. Until she was dying, the thought had never entered my mind. She was monolithic and insurmountable, the keeper of my life. She would grow old and still work in the garden. The image was fixed in my mind, like one of the memories from her childhood that I'd made her explain so intricately that I remembered as if it were mine.""""What if I forgave myself? I thought. What if I forgave myself even though I'd done something I shouldn't have? What if I was a liar and a cheat and there was no excuse for what I'd done other than because it was what I wanted and needed to do? What if I was sorry, but if I could go back in time I wouldn't do anything differently than I had done? What if I'd actually wanted to fuck every one of those men? What if heroin taught me something? What if yes was the right answer instead of no? What if what made me do all those things everyone thought I shouldn't have done was what also had got me here? What if I was never redeemed? What if I already was?""First read: March-April 2012Second read: February 2016!121!Finally finished listening to this as an audio. Meh. I have my problems with it. I may or may not review it, we'll see.***Alright, I've given it some thought and feel that I should try to capture some of what this book made me feel (and didn't feel as it were). This memoir is essentially two stories that sometimes intersect with each other but more often than not run parallel. One story is Cheryl's 90+ day 1100 mile solo hike of the Pacific Crest Trail when she was 26 years old. The other story is of the tragic death of Cheryl's mother from lung cancer four years previously. That story is one of all-consuming grief, anger, and a downward spiral into dangerous and self-destructive behaviors. Even though it was the death of her mother which precipitated Cheryl's decision to solo hike the PCT, I felt like the two stories are so very different from each other that it just doesn't work to have both accounts in the same book. I found it jarring each time Cheryl flashbacks to a moment in her pre-PCT life. Don't get me wrong, both stories interested me. I was eager to read about a crazy girl taking on this extreme physical challenge. I adore man vs. nature tales. And although I found it difficult and somewhat emotionally draining, I also wanted to read about the particulars of Cheryl's grief and the details surrounding her mother's death. I lost my own mother to cancer in July 2010 and I find myself inexplicably hungering for the accounts of other people's experience of such profound tragedy. The problem I have with the book overall I guess, is that the two stories do not complement each other very well. Some sections in which Cheryl describes the horror of helping her mother die and the depth of the grief which followed are beautifully and honestly written. The scene involving her mother's horse is seared upon my memory. These sections are at odds however, with Cheryl's account of her selfish, self-destructive behavior after her mother's death. We all grieve differently, and there is no right way. Cheryl's chronic infidelities, drug abuse, and finally her decision to hike the PCT totally inexperienced and extremely ill-equipped I did not find interesting. In fact, it pushed me away rather than drew me in. I felt turned off. It's one thing to do something wholeheartedly rash and stupid and dangerous when you are 26 years old, but to try and wax poetic about it in hindsight in your 40s is not cool. I felt like Cheryl romanticized her hike waaaaaay too much, a reminiscence with rose-colored glasses. Sure she talks about the blisters and the patches of dry skin, the weight loss, the hunger, the thirst, the heat. But she downplays the imminent very real dangers for a happy story that all worked out in the end. Her PCT hike could have -- should have -- ended quite disastrously. She went about it very naively, with little or no real knowledge or hiking experience. Her mistakes were massive and at times ridiculous. You can choose to laugh about them in retrospect, but the message really should be: kids, don't try this at home. I felt like grown-up Cheryl should have been apologizing for her reckless stunt rather than almost ... bragging about it. Yes, there is a definite tone of bragging and conceit (that can't all be attributed to the audiobook's reader). Maybe that's what turned me off the most, and that is certainly a very subjective, personal response I know. If you like reading about dysfunctional people as their lives spiral out of control this book may appeal to you. If you like to read about people doing crazy ass stunts then by all means, take on the story of this young woman as she haphazardly and with zealous abandon hikes into the woods with a mammoth pack on her back and boots that are one size too small. Cheryl's story may inspire you. It did not have that effect on me.!121!This was a very enjoyable read! I think memoirs are the best books to be listened to on audiobook because it feels (or rather, sounds) like a friend relating a story to you. Cheryl had a great voice and although she's a flawed human being and isn't afraid to write about the times she's messed up, she has a very unapologetic and feminist voice that I wasn't expecting. It didn't really hit me how strong a woman has to be to hike over 80 days completely alone and the challenges and prejudices she would have to overcome. This was definitely an interesting story and uplifting, and every time I had free time, I was very eager to continue this!The reason I counted off one star is because she would sometimes go into veeeery extended stories about her life before the trail, which I understand is relevant to why she felt motivated to hike the trail, but at times, the information felt extraneous. At one point there was an extremely vivid and graphic scene describing the time that her brother had to shoot their mother's horse in order to put it down, and as a horse owner and general animal lover, I was really disturbed by that scene and want to warn any readers about that scene who are sensitive to animals suffering. I haven't seen the movie but I can see how it would be very cool! This was definitely an interesting read with a great message about self-discovery and resilience that also has its moments of friendship and humor.!121!I have thought these things: I am done with books proclaiming to tell the story of healing when the wounds are so obviously still raw. I am done with struggles-that-are-not-really-struggles, the so-called ""first world problems"" that make one's eyes roll and ones jaw clench. How did she get so much buzz for this terribly whiny book? I'll ask myself, barely able to get through the first third without hucking it across the room. I thank other reviewers for making the contrast between Eat, Pray, Love and Wild. I'd include a few other books written, I thought, in the rush of loss or certainty-of-wisdom that were not, indeed, wise: An Exact Replica of a Figment of My Imagination is one that immediately comes to mind. There are others.I read this book despite all these things, and because I have never been steered wrong by Cheryl before (we're friends, and I've read most of her public writing, including about half of her Dear Sugar columns). I read this book hoping to be proven right in my faith in her and wrong in my worry it would not go well, this struggle-against-the-wilderness, this wisdom-discovery.Indeed. I was proven right and wrong in all the best ways. Wild is a luminous exception. It is a story of birth more than it is a story of death (though her mother's death a few years earlier is the centerpiece of the book); it is a story of joy more than it is a story of pain (though pain is on almost every page, rippling, fleshy, scarring pain). I skated through it, flipped, plodded, ran, like Cheryl, wanting to rush but then holding back and making sure I read it closely enough to render an informed review. When you begin, when you join Cheryl on this improbable hike, of course, you expect her ill preparation and her constant desire to give up and many, many complaints. But she does not give up, she stubbornly struggles through, and even I think many times oh, you'd be best to quit right now... but you know that she will not and you are so proud. You are along for the fight, Monster and all. You wish you could float down on a feather with another $20 or a better pair of boots. You wish you could sit her down a few months before her hike and plan out a schedule of training hikes. But you can't, so instead, you begin to imagine your own hike and you are searingly jealous of her 12-hour-days of loneliness and thought. How much I would think in that time, you think. Oh how I could use that right now.I got it, though; through her voice and eyes I have hiked the trail without the right-sized boots and with a pack far too heavy to imagine. I do not have to leave my boys with their aunt for months while I find myself; I have found myself on the trail with her, there, in the burning heat and the shivering cold, sweaty and wondrous and stinky and limping and profound. How wild it is.Finally, a disclaimer. Very probably, if I did not know Cheryl I would find quibbles enough with this book to knock my five stars down to four. I don't like to just gush around giving five stars to things, even very good things, because how can one write a perfect book? No. This isn't perfect. But, I am going to invoke my license to be biased, this time.!121!I'll admit that the first time and place I heard of this book was 'the Gilmore Girls - a Year in the Life'. All the backpackers are gathered to go on a hike and they form groups based on the book or the movie. That put it on my list and I eventually got around to it. I'm glad I did.I have heard of people hiking the Appalachian Trial, but I didn't really know about the PCT. Reading this book did make me want to try out parts of the AT. I'm not so interested in the PCT. I figure it's much more popular to do this now than in 1995 so it won't be as wild, there will be more people and maybe that's ok too. I'm sure you would still feel plenty alone at times.What I enjoyed about the book was seeing the mess Cheryl made of her life. I mean, she messed her life up about as much as a person can at this point. It makes me feel better to know that this isn't so unusual and not everyone has all the shit together all the time. Cheryl went through something hard and luckily she found her way back. It can be so easy to melt down in life at times and we have to find ways to come back to life. I feel like this really was a spirit walk. She was finding her way back to 'life'.I loved hearing about her face to face with critters on the trail. I have come face to face with a mountain lion and I know how that can be. I feel lucky to be alive in many ways. I'm glad nothing horrible happened to her either. I also enjoyed hearing how she made it despite not really being a hiker and being prepared. This is a wonderful story of a life. I feel like she told the tale honestly and bravely. Thank you for sharing with the world Cheryl.!121!I finally read it! It was definitely a ""right book, right time"" kind of read for me, too. Love when that happens.Click here to hear more of my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive!!121!I just finished this book, which I bought because I enjoy day hiking, have been to the High Sierra and desert environments, and love good writing about hiking and mountaineering, from Joe Simpson’s books to A Walk in the Woods. I have to say that I am mystified by the positive reviews, particularly in magazines such as Backpacker and Outside. In fact, based on my own experiences hiking, and the author’s often vague and contradictory depiction of her hike on the Pacific Crest Trail, I believe her account to be extremely exaggerated, at the very least. I base this conclusion on the following observations: •	One of the recurrent tropes in the book is the loss of toenails due to ill-fitting hiking boots; the author repeatedly describes her toenails becoming black and then falling off (p. 5, and at various points throughout the book). I lost toenails a number of times while studying ballet, but never in the manner that she describes. More to the point, as discussed below, why didn’t she have boots which were properly fitted, which she at least attempted to test out prior to beginning the Pacific Crest Trail?•	Given the photography equipment that she describes having taken (p. 40), and the importance of the Pacific Crest Trail hike in her emotional development, how is it that she has no pictures, at all?•	How is she able to carry her pack for 20+ miles (before it is repacked for her by another hiker along the trail) if she is unable to “budge it an inch in an air-conditioned motel room” (p. 43), and an adult man says that he can barely lift it (p. 49), because it has all of her gear and over 26 pounds of water? Particularly given that she claims she did no physical conditioning prior to starting the hike (p. 58)?•	She claims that she bought The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume I: California and read it “a dozen times” before beginning the hike (p. 57). She calls this book her “bible” and “lifeline” (p. 58). So how does she not know that she will have to carry water in the Mojave Desert until “a couple of weeks before” she begins the hike? How is it that she doesn’t know that a gallon of water weighs over eight pounds? How did she not know to check trail conditions in the High Sierra ahead of time, so that she would have been aware that that portion of the trail was impassable due to snow?•	She claims that prior to beginning her hike she took the time required to learn “how to make dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky,” to complete “a refresher course on basic first aid,” and to practice “using my water purifier in my kitchen sink” (p. 57). Given that she made these preparations over “months of planning,” why did she not pack her backpack to check its weight (p. 58), physically condition herself for the hike (p. 58), or attempt to break in (and return) her too-small boots during that same period of time? •	She claims that she went to REI “about a dozen times” to purchase gear, and listened to its employees “talk about gear, with interest and nuance,” for a “dumbfounding” length of time (p. 40-41). So how is it that she doesn’t know about REI’s return policy until informed by another hiker, especially because it applies to the boots that are allegedly torturing her (p. 199)? How is it that she ended up with the wrong fuel for her backpacking stove (p. 67)?•	By her fourth day on the trail, carrying her enormous, heavy backpack, she supposedly has blistered feet (p. 67), a gash in her shin “seeping copious blood” with “a knot the size of a fist” under it (p. 67), and has scraped off “all the skin on the top of my right index finger” (p. 69). She’s also hiking in a desert, although she does not describe the experience of that sort of extreme environment until later in the book (p. 191-193), and does not mention the temperature, even though she claims to have had a thermometer at the time (p. 65, 192). So how does she cover 9 miles that day (p. 70)? Later, in addition to all of these injuries, she falls while traversing a rockslide, and ends up with her knee “pulsing in pain and bleeding” (p. 82). Yet somehow, again in the desert environment, she manages 8.5 miles (p. 82).•	As for the part where she hikes for days in falling-apart sandals reinforced with duct tape (p. 215-216), that simply does not sound possible to me, but I would defer to someone with real backpacking experience as to the plausibility of such a feat.•	Supposedly her mother stayed with her abusive father for the first six years of her life. During that time he apparently choked her mother, alternatively asked the kids if they would leave forever with him and told them that he was going to throw them out on the street, smashed plates against the wall, and repeatedly shook his fist in her face while asking her whether she wanted a “knuckle sandwich” (p. 131-132, 205). But when she catalogues her list of grievances against her mother (p. 265-266), staying with this horrifically abusive man is never mentioned. Instead, she complains that her mother smoked pot, left her and her siblings alone, threatened to spank them with a wooden spoon, allowed them to call her by her first name, was annoyingly optimistic but cool and distant with her friends, and didn’t suggest that she apply to Harvard.In short, one should not expect an accurate account of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail from this book. One should also be prepared for fatuous (“I was a great believer in things, but I was also a great non-believer in things”) and ridiculously melodramatic depictions of emotional life, and gratuitous “gross-out” scenes, primarily involving the removal of toenails and the killing of a horse. Overall, it’s the kind of writing and story that’s tolerable for a three-page Oprah Magazine article read in a doctor’s waiting room, but is excruciating when drawn out over a 300+ page book.!121!I recently listened to the audio of Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar, which I loved and which made me think that Cheryl Strayed has a special kind of wisdom. It made me think that I should read Wild, which is also by Cheryl Strayed. For the longest time, despite many encouraging recommendations, I had been hesitant to read Wild because how could a story about a 1000+ mile trek possibly be interesting? It’s obviously an intense experience for the person doing the walking, but why should I care about her internal thoughts, epiphanies about herself and the world, achy feet and random encounters with people and creatures? The answer I now know is because it’s written by Cheryl Strayed. I didn’t love this as much as Tiny Beautiful Things, but I certainly recognized what I love about this author. She writes incredibly well. She can make the mundane seem interesting and meaningful. And her manner of introspection doesn’t feel overly self-indulgent. Having said this, the Strayed on the trail is younger than the Strayed of Tiny Beautiful Things, and at times I grew impatient with her youthful preoccupations – i.e. should she bring any condoms? How many? Who might they be worth using with? But this is a minor complaint, Strayed’s honesty and wisdom resonate with me, and I will happily read her next foray into non-fiction – or even fiction.A note on the audio: Strayed does not read Wild whereas she does read Tiny Beautiful Things. Having become used to her voice in Tiny Beautiful Things, I really missed it in Wild, although the narrator of Wild is perfectly adequate.Thank you to the many GR friends who encouraged me to read Wild.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir']"
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business (Hardcover),Charles Duhigg,4.13,503532,2012,"A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail.!121!Read this because of fascinating NYT magazine excerpt on how Target tracks our buying habits. The rest of the book is not as compelling -- anecdotes sometimes don't support particular arguments he's attempting to illustrate (the Hey-Ya examples being the most egregious), and his section on how social movements occur is weak and unconvincing, and not really about habits, per se. Style and structure were often clunky, and the book seems a bit muddled as its ultimate purpose. I dunno, I guess I was expecting slightly more substantial psychology or social science and instead got more of a book solidly for businesses/manager types and people on the beginning of their self-help journeys. But I fall into the latter category, so why am I pooh pooh-ing this book so much? I dunno. Maybe I am just jealous of how $$$ money this dude's gonna make at corporate speaking gigs. Anyway, lessons I'll take away -- *making your bed every morning and committing to regular exercise are two habits that can transform your entire goddamn life*Diagram about mouse brain activity spike post-reward eventually arriving prior to reward (the origin of cravings)*Changing habits requires identifying the cues and rewards that trigger and support the habit behavior, then trying out various substitutes for the behavior that might achieve the same reward*deliberate advance plans for responding to challenging situations can be extremely helpful (ex Scottish knee/hip replacement patients, Michael Phelps, Starbucks)*With more challenging habits like alcoholism or stuff related to football, true belief and submission to some higher purpose is necessary*in general, it's more effective to change others' habits if you make them believe they have some power or authority over their decision than if you coerce them with force *casinos are super evil!121!This is great book, and you need to read it. How is that for a definitive opening line? The reason it’s such a good book is because it uses research to explain how habits are formed and changed. Everyone knows someone who was out of shape, or was a smoker, and then in what appeared as if almost overnight, changed themselves in a short period of time. How did they do that? They formed new habits and changed old ones, that’s how.Do something enough and it becomes a habit, good or bad. This is explained in the book by research on memory loss. For example, the research found that patients suffering from memory loss could not show someone where the kitchen is when asked, but once they got hungry the would get up and go to the kitchen automatically.This is made possible by the habit loop of cue, routine, and reward. The cue makes the brain find the routine as it anticipates the reward. A classic example is stress and smoking, the cue is stress, the routine is smoking, the reward is the feeling the cigarette brings.I was most interested in how the book described changing a habit. Let’s face it, we all have habits we want to change. To accomplish this we need to keep the cue and reward, but change the routine. I’ll use an example from my own life to illustrate. I love chocolate, and to make it worse I love to eat at it night. Well I love to eat at night because that is how I formed the habit some time ago. I used the guidance from this book to change that habit. I kept the cue and reward, but I changed the routine to use apples instead of chocolate.This logic flows into much larger problem sets such as organizations and communities. Focus on changing one thing, the keystone habit from which a cascade of other habits will form. The author illustrates this example by discussing how the company Alcoa was transformed by the keystone habit of a singular focus on safety.The book flows really well and uses research throughout to substantiate the concepts presented. The audience who can benefit from this book is vast, from individuals to corporates to governments.!121!I was looking forward to a substantial, science and evidence based, compelling read, but just found many mixed up ego and self finding trips, business manager motivation yada, and some good points accidentally mixed in. Read Clear James` Atomic habits instead, it´s much better. What is really strange is that the chapters seem to follow a logical approach, if one orients her/himself as always first by the titles of the index, and it looks like they are dealing with the meta or concrete context, but are in reality just anecdotes, except of some technobabble about Target´s use of pattern recognition, AI, and behavioral science; I mean, why? Was it too difficult to pimp the already written material with the help of some experts to combine both nonfiction and autobiographical elements instead of this? It seems as if many people are getting their swift kick out of procrastination by material available in any newspaper column, youtube guru channel, or whatever, but I just don´t get the hype around it. Worst of it, with this social science mixup and freely interpretation of the stories in a highly subjective style he is entering the realm of, don´t be scared or stop reading and forget liking my review, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...You see, it´s sweet if some unique people with subjective mindsets and different characters deal with difficult situations in a positive way, but I don´t get the picture of how Duhigg can extrapolate this to universal ideas as if he would have used real scientific evidence of, let´s say, long term studies going over decades with millions of participants, or brain chemistry, neurology, or anything substantial instead of person XY had results YZ. This has absolutely no worth for the reader. There are a handful of useful tips one can take away, most of them available in shorter, better, free, and easier form available in many wikis (see end of the review) if one just searches for motivation, positive psychology, meditation, self reflection, behavior, etc. that don´t just repeat commonplaces. How he is trying to deal with addiction is pop psychology at it´s worst and that the book doesn´t really offer solutions, plans, or at least good sources for more research is the kicker, as it´s what the title and marketing are implying and promising. It´s not totally bad, but very, very overhyped and the sad thing is that people mind find it great to read this motivating stories, but without a concrete plan to self development and improvement, the motivation fades away as quickly as the memory of the redundant, convertible tiny tales. Oh, did I mention that reading the book has the lovely extra element of being belittled by a condescending, narcissistic writing style? A completely failed approach that depreciates the few, good elements in it and insults the reader. Ok, one more, it stigmatizes the victims of gambling, addictions, or shopaholics instead of just moving a centimeter (review written in Europe, sorry) towards asking why such unregulated industries can easily hunt down already weakened human game. Shame on you, gambler! Evil shopaholic! How dare you having an alcohol problem! That´s a wise, mature, and productive way of dealing with serious topics. Without this, I would have given 3 stars, but including own, restricted bias and agenda disguised as facts downed it to 2. Funny, just now that I am thinking about it, how each hard earned everyman bill has to be tracked down and taxed, while letting people lose everything within hours, the reasons for addictions, or brainwashing for consumerism is absolutely no problem and Duhigg is completely ignoring the structures producing the problems because he is so busy with victim blaming and shaming. Other authors stay objective or avoid such topics instead of superficially dealing with it to boost sales. I am pretty sure that some of the concepts and ideas won´t stand the test of time, as real science, medicine, and screening technology improve, and as they appear like very soft humanities stuff. A final subjective list of elements a good nonfiction book should at least have, that are quite missing in this one:A detailed plan how to DIY.Own theories that are defined as subjective opinions in the case of humanities or, and in natural sciences, proofed by many hard facts.New combinations of existing theories and ideas.Entertaining, very well written anecdotes. There is not much new under the sun and most fictional and nonfiction works are remixes and new interpretations of facts and tropes, but that doesn´t mean that it have to be loveless, average, wrong, and presumptuous concoctions. But thanks for extra training to deal with anger through cognitive techniques and quick meditations, at least it´s good for that.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful...!121!This may be a crappy review since its going up via iPhone. Sorry. First caveat: I work in research. A big part of my job is creating these habit loops and seeing if they can be altered or enhanced via medication. Second caveat: I'm a nerd and love journal articles, scientific writing, and technical reading, even off the job.Third caveat: I only got to chapter eight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting. By far and large, when there's big buzz about a book I inevitably dislike it with very few exceptions. I was hoping for something smart and eye opening; a different, more personal take on habits and addiction (which is really what a habit is if you think about it), and I was let down mostly by the writing and anecdotes. I realize this book isn't intended for scientific review, but when there were so many teasing moments of talking about the research going on, I guess I just expected a little more substance in laymans terms. The biggest problem I had with the book was that I probably could have only read the first few chapters and have a total grasp of the theory. While some stories were interesting, they reminded me of Grandpa Simpson's storytelling. I don't think we needed so many examples that all said the same thing. Think of all the trees that could have been saved if a few were omitted. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad read. People with a non-neuroscience background can enjoy it and will learn something from it. Although how to apply it to your life is pretty much missing from the book (unless it was in the chapters I didn't get to yet). Yeah, find a new reward to break bad habits, but how? It would have been interesting to see those suggestions. Overall, not horrible. Had it not been a book club read I wouldn't have picked it up of my own volition, but I'm not upset that I read most of it. I am upset that I kept reading hoping to get something different in the next chapter, which didn't happen. Just save the time and money and read his NY Times article (at least I think it was there) instead.!121!I need to start with the obvious – this guy is one of those writers. One of those writers that make you want to track him down and hurt him. And not just him, maybe even his pets too. He assumes you are as thick as dog-shit and that you won’t get what it is he is talking about unless he makes it painfully (PAINFULLY) clear. He has missed his calling. He really should have gone into the self-help book market – let’s face it, assuming your readers are dumb in that market is just ‘responding to reality’. You might be wondering why I gave this book three stars, given I wanted to find ways to hurt the author. Well, the problem is that some of the ideas here are not insane, in fact, some are really well worth thinking about. It’s just that someone (someone who also needs hunted down, now that I think about it) has told this guy you need to ‘tell a story’. And while this is often excellent advice – you also need to remember that people are reading your book for a reason and that reason isn’t to cry over the last moments of a drug addict’s life or to find out how the skunk lady got laid. No, it is to find out about the affect of habits and what we can do to change the habits of a life time that are stuffing up our lives.I’ve been reading lots of Bourdieu lately. He talks of Habitus – what he calls the ‘feel for the game’, but basically the habits we have that are so unconscious we don't even know they are habits and so, therefore, have no idea what a huge part they play in shaping the kinds of people we are. So we tend to think that because we wouldn’t do something someone else clearly has done that automatically qualifies us for the golden stamp of merit. Whereas, so much of what we do in life is either non-rational or automatic – having those automatic structures implanted in us from no age is more a matter of luck than of rational deliberation.This guy stuffs up his argument at the end by not having the conviction of what his view on habits was telling him. He tells a long, long, long story of a woman that lost everything through gambling. Terribly sad and all that. But obviously this book is written in America and so nothing can come between the rights of rich people to take money from poor people. So, the fact that casinos do everything to manipulate you so that you end up with nothing is YOUR fault, not theirs – have you no self control? Have you no free will? I think this guy should read Sam Harris’s new book. Either that or he needs to also argue that it should be ok for drug dealers to offer kids drugs at schools and in the streets – if one is wrong it isn’t at all obvious why the other is right. And if not drugs to kids, then drugs to adults – unless I’m missing something the same argument applies.This book is quite chilling in that it explains – in very long and all too often boring detail, in fact endless bloody detail, just how companies like Target are targeting you and manipulating you to buy and buy and buy. Yet again this is presented as if it was nothing to be concerned about – but I struggled to read it as something I should just shrug and get over. When I first learned about data warehousing it sent a cold shiver down my spine – I have never had ‘Fly Buys’ or any other of those ‘loyalty’ programs that give those arseholes all of my details so they can work out how to better market to people like me. I’m manipulated enough in life without needing to provide billionaires with better weapons to trip me up.The information in this book is very worthwhile. But if you ever needed proof that Gladwell has lots to answer for, this book is Item A on the case for the prosecution. And what the hell is it about American Football? I hope to God it isn’t nearly as uninteresting to watch as it is to read about. No wonder Americans invade countries at the drop of a hat – anything to get away from two down on the thirty-first yard line with a wingback on a hiding to nowhere blah, blah AHHHHH!!!!!121!Nothing Succeeds Like Success: A Case StudyHey. Have you heard of Thomas Baker? How about Carol Wright? Chris Cameron? Vineet Shaw? Let us discuss Baker.Thomas Baker was an average joe, but not without ambitions. A few years ago, acting on a tip, Tom, a competitive enough guy, decided to take his life into his own hands. What’s more, he decided to pick up one more Self-help book and this time follow up thoroughly on it. No holds barred. He asked around, looked in that wonderful site and finally decided on what seemed to him like the best out there right now. The ratings seemed to be out of the world too. The author, in the intro, even tries to reassure him against feeling overwhelmed by the excess of research in the book. This is exactly the sort of help that Tom needed. Tom read the book with great diligence. He made notes and he made placards and he even bought magnets for his fridge and special sticky tapes for his mirrors. He knew this could work. He only had to believe.He changed his routines, identified and included habit-forming cues. He created them, he played around with them, he even had some fun. He was very inventive and imaginative. The author would have commended the effort if he knew. Tom decide that he would write to Duhigg about his success once it pays off. A month passed. Tom had made slight improvements but no major pay-off seemed to be in the offing. He chided himself for expecting windfalls. He reminded himself that these things take time. He kept at it.6 months now. Even the minor gains he had made originally have fallen by the wayside now. He had read the book thrice in this time, trying to reaffirm his faith. He was discouraged now but he kept at it.2 years. The book is long forgotten. But Tom had taken the trouble to document his experiences and had sent a detailed case study to the author. He had requested that it be included in the next edition of the book. He wanted the author to include a chapter on failures - on how it might not work for everyone. He wanted a caveat, a mild statement of warning that just because a book worth of case studies of success is presented, there is no reason to expect that any approach (no matter how good) might work for everyone. Humans would be fulfilling Asimovesque dreams if that were the case. He thought this would add depth and realism to an otherwise fine book.He did not even get an auto-generated acknowledgment slip. But that was ok, he had discovered a new Gladwell book on another airport aisle. Apparently, it is not just habits that doesn’t stick, lessons don’t either.!121!The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business is a book by Charles Duhigg, a New York Times reporter, published in February 2012 by Random House. The Habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form good ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers the brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional, or physical routine. عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی»؛ «نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟»؛ «قدرت عادت»؛ «قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟»؛ «قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم»؛ «قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم»؛ «قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها»؛ «قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی»؛ ‬«قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار»؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دهم ماه سپتامبر سال2014میلادیعنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چالز دوهینگ؛ مترجم: پروین بیات؛ تهران، هورمزد، سال‏‫1392؛ در335ص؛ شابک9786006958118؛ چاپ دوم سال1393؛ چاپهای چهارم تا هشتم سال1393؛ در352ص؛ چاپ دهم سال1394؛ در352ص؛ چاپ چهاردهم سال1396؛ چاپهای پانزدهم و شانزدهم سال1397؛ موضوع جنبه های اجتماعی عادت از نویسندگان ایالات متحده امریکا - سده21م‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرا کارهایی را در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: سکینه تقی زاده؛ اصفهان، گاهداد، سال1394؛ در340ص؛ شابک9786009382125؛عنوان: نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: ندا نایب‌پور، محمدرضا مینایی؛ اصفهان: آمیس، سال1395؛ در207ص؛ شابک9786005419795؛ عنوان: نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟ نویسنده: چالرز دیوهیگ؛ مترجم: علی هداوند؛ تهران پندار‌تابان‏‫، سال1395؛ در328ص؛ شابک9786006895598؛ چاپ دوم سال1396؛ چاپ سوم سال1397؛ چاپ چهارم سال1398؛عنوان: ‬قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: مصطفی طرسکی، معصومه ثابت‌قدم؛ ویراستار: طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران نوین توسعه‏‫، سال‏‫‏‏‏‏‬1396؛ در329ص؛ شابک9786008738091؛ چاپهای دوم و سوم سال1396؛ چاپ هفتم سال1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ ؛ مترجم: شهرزاد حکیم‌مختار؛ تهران معیار اندیشه، سال‏‫1398؛ در288ص؛ شابک9786005462746؛‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: الهام شریف؛ تهران : نسل نواندیش‏‫‬، سال1396؛ در344ص؛ شابک9789642369119؛ ‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: اصغر اندرودی؛ کرج: در دانش بهمن،‏ سال1395؛ در342ص؛ شابک9789641741794؛ چاپ دوم سال1396؛ چاپهای سوم و چهارم سال1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: فروزنده دولتیاری؛ تهران: چابک اندیش، سال‏‫‏‏‏‏1397؛ در352ص؛ شابک9786005861259؛‬‬‬عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: طیبه شیخی؛ قم: دارالفنون بوریا، سال‏‫1398؛ در270ص؛ شابک97862295661؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهینگ؛ مترجم: زهرا شاه‌قلعه؛ قم: آوای بیصدا، سال‏‫1398؛ در368ص؛ شابک9786009926459؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی؛ نویسنده: کارلس (چارلز) دوهیگ؛ مترجم: مرجان فرجی؛ تهران،رشد، سال‏‫1398؛ در440ص؛ شابک9786003511248؛ کتاب «قدرت عادت» یکی از کتابهای پیروزمند روانشناسی است، که نخستین بار در سال2013میلادی توسط «چارلز دوهینگ» نگاشته شد، و به زودی از پرفروش‌ترین کتابهای «نیویورک» شد؛ «دوهینگ» در این کتاب بیان می‌کند، که این عادت‌های ما هستند، که زندگیمان را شکل می‌دهند، و «قدرت عادت» و تأثیر آن در زندگی انسان را بازنمایی می‌کنند؛ و در پی آن موضوع را بیان می‌کنند: (اگر انسان بتواند عادت‌های خود را تغییر بدهد، می‌تواند رفتار و زندگانی خود را نیز تغییر دهد)، و در پایان نیز الگوهایی برای دیگر کردن عادت‌ها ارائه می‌دهندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/03/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/01/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!This long-winded book explains how habits form in individuals, organizations, and social groups. Despite the intriguing premise, the verbose anecdotes left me screaming, “I get the point already!” A better book (or article) would have resulted from taking the appendix (a short, practical guide to changing a habit) and adding some of the psychological research and a few brief examples. (After I wrote this review, I discovered Charles Duhigg's New York Times article, which is basically what I described). The book’s moral is a respectable one: once you’re aware of a bad habit, it’s your responsibility to change it.My favorite case study was the one about Target using predictive analytics and behavioral research to personalize its marketing to each shopper’s habits.• A habit is a cue that triggers a routine that results in a reward.• Habits can’t be eradicated; they can only be replaced.• The Golden Rule of Habit Change: to replace a habit, keep the cue and reward but replace the routine.• “For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”• Studies show that willpower is a finite resource; it's like a muscle that tires with use. Willpower can be increased by exercising self-discipline. Increasing self-discipline in one area of life increases it in other areas.• To introduce new habits, “sandwich” them between existing ones so they feel familiar.• Habits are most susceptible to being altered when your life changes. Having a baby is the event that produces the most habit changes.!121!I remember reading a story by the famous Malayalam writer Padmarajan called Oru Sameepakala Durantham (""A Tragedy of Recent Times""). It tells of a housing colony in Kerala, bitten by the exercise bug in the early eighties. Someone gets up before sunrise and starts jogging. Soon, he is joined by more and more people until the whole colony is out running, every day. This leaves the houses unattended which comes to the notice of a group of thieves: and they conduct a spate of early morning robberies. The people of the colony, even after a couple of houses are robbed, continue their morning ritual - they can't stop, even after they know that their houses may be invaded any time.Padmarajan ostensibly wrote this seemingly absurd and Kafkaesque story to make fun of the urban animal, blindly following the latest fad. But he may have more true to life than he thought.Such is the power of habit.------------------------------This book by Duhigg, if you can get past the unnecessarily prolix prose, says a very simple but significant thing: habit is what drives you. From picking your nose to gambling away your life's savings, ingrained habits hard-coded into your brain makes you tick. It follows the ""cue-routine-reward"" loop as illustrated below:(Cue = a certain time; routine = eat a cookie; reward = diversion from work)Habits are not endemic to people alone - organisations and societies also have habits, which why they are so resistant to change.The key to getting rid of a destructive habit is to replace it with a constructive one. In the loop illustrated above, the cue and the reward would remain the same, but a different routine can be substituted. See below:(Here the routine of ""have a drink"" is replaced with ""have a chat"")This is easier said than done, however: it requires real effort to identify a habit, and great will power (which can be cultivated, according to Duhigg) to change it. But it can be done. Successful individuals have changed their lives by changing destructive habits: successful executives have turned around companies by changing corporate habits: and leaders have transformed societies. Examples abound in this book.And please note: supermarket chains and gambling dens monitor our habits and feed those which will drain our pockets and maximise their profits.------------------------------This book is well worth a read. I only wish that the author had cut the fluff and trimmed it down to a slimmer volume. But then, the HABIT of writing needlessly long books among American journalists is one that dies hard.!121!Judging from the prologue of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, the first thing necessary in modifying one’s behavior is to note the actual components of that behavior. The author cites a visit with a military officer in charge of normalizing a village (Kufa) in Iraq. The officer started by observing video of how riots began and noticed that the trouble usually broke out after people had milled around for a while and food trucks and spectators arrived. He changed the behavior by asking the mayor not to allow food trucks into the areas where people were demonstrating (p. 13 on Sony eReader, as will be all pagination in the remainder of this review). Something as simple as the presence of food trucks threw off a habit of violence and allowed some normalization. This seemed amazing, but something resonated strongly with this truth.The Power of Habits begins with anecdotal accounts of people who changed destructive habits in their lives and one account of a man who had absolutely no short term memory but was able to function as a result of habits already ingrained within him. The latter case demonstrated that there was something distinctive between one part of our brain and another. So, the author takes the reader on a tour of a lab at M.I.T. where scientists have been researching a golf ball-sized lump in the brain called the basal ganglia since 1990 (p. 25). Apparently, the basal ganglia stores habits while the rest of the brain works less and less because the “chunks” of actions stored in that section of the brain takes over (p. 26). Arriving at this understanding, researchers were able to use different experiments to ascertain a “habit loop.” They noticed that a certain cue triggers a set of automatic reactions such that the being feels rewarded. As a result of being rewarded, there is an even stronger response to the same cue on the next occasion (p. 29) Of course, if reward can reinforce the habit whenever one senses that cue, changing the reward can eventually extinguish that habit (p. 30) as the researchers discovered by moving the chocolate around the maze to mess up the behaviors.So, what kinds of “cues” work? The Power of Habits tells the story of Claude Hopkins, an advertising legend who “created” the demand for toothpaste by creating a “craving.” Hopkins noticed in dental research that there is a film that forms on our teeth. He decided to get people to “feel” the mucin plaques on their teeth by calling them “the film” and suggesting that “beauty” comes from eliminating the film (p. 40). By identifying a “cue” (the film that is almost always there) and suggesting a “reward” (getting rid of that film), he established a multi-million dollar product. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, the book goes on to tell the story of Febreze, the air freshener that started out as a failure. Even though it was extremely effective in getting rid of odors, it wasn’t selling because people in odiferous situations became used to the odors. They weren’t getting the cue. So, there had to be a better way to cue the reward and that came to be with pleasant fragrances and the idea of “finishing” a task with beautiful smelling Febreze (a tactic that is still being used in dozens of new products in this product line to the present day (p. 56). The “habit loop” works even better when a “craving” is attached to it. It turns out that Pepsodent already had the craving element built in with the citric acid or mint taste that rewarded users with a tingling sense of feeling clean. It’s pretty masterful the way this author closes the loop in each chapter.Then, a chapter introduces the “Golden Rule” of habit change. It notes that you can never quite remove a bad habit, but you need to substitute a new routine between the cue and the reward (p. 61). In this chapter, Tony Dungy’s coaching philosophy of substituting a simpler playbook with more repetition for the old routine of over-thinking what one might be trying to do. In this way, the new routine would reside between the cue (hiking the ball?) and the reward (scoring a touchdown? Making a sack of the QB?) and more success would result (p. 62). Naturally, this chapter wraps Dungy’s experiences with turning around the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts football teams around the history of Alcoholics Anonymous. Both Dungy as a coach and Bill Wilson who founded A.A. teach people to substitute new routines for the old ones (p. 68), bad football in the former and alcohol abuse in the latter.One of the keys to Dungy’s eventual success and one of the core tenets of A.A. (or any 12-step) program is that one must believe in something. Dungy complained early on that practice was going well and everything was coming together, but the training would disappear during the big games. When he heard the players saying that they went back to what they knew during critical games, Dungy said, “What they were really saying was that they trusted our system most of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broken down.” (p. 75) And, as one researching from the University of New Mexico noted, belief is critical in order for change to work in the long run (p. 78). The section on “habits” in business wasn’t as interesting to me, but even there I found some intriguing aspects. It was fascinating to read about how “keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.” (p. 109) This section told the story of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O’ Neill’s success at Alcoa. O’ Neill’s emphasis was safety. By placing the emphasis on safety, he gave the corporation something around which management (because of reducing lost work days) and unions (because of emphasizing the safety of the workers) could both agree upon. There was also an insight with regard to the gay liberation movement. Duhigg suggests that when the Library of Congress re-categorized books on homosexuality as its own subject matter rather than under mental illness, it provided a paradigm shift that fueled the movement (p. 100). It just shows how little shifts can have seismic effects, not only on individuals, but on society.Another corporate chapter used an experiment on willpower where half of the group was allowed to eat fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies while another group was forced to eat radishes. Sounds like the latter would have a healthy advantage when the group was asked to perform a complex problem which had no real solution! Sounds like they would be more mentally fresh! Wrong! Those who had eaten the radishes were most likely to quit after only a few minutes while the cookie eaters kept on for half an hour or so. Why? Researchers concluded that the first portion of the experiment had used up much of the finite willpower in the radish eaters (p. 119). A later study showed that using kindness to set up the willpower goals as opposed to ordering willpower allowed those who experienced kindness to concentrate longer (p. 130).Building on that idea, Duhigg recounted a Scottish rehabilitation study where the elderly patients who were most successful in learning to walk again in spite of excruciating pain had identified potential obstacles in advance and created their own ways of dealing with them. “Put another way, the patients’ plans were built around inflection points when they knew their pain—and thus the temptation to quit—would be the strongest.” (p. 124) Starbucks put this to work in what they called the LATTE method (Listen to the customer, Acknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, Thank them, and then, Explain why the problem occurred.) in dealing with irate customers (p. 126).Another chapter deals with destructive institutional habits: “There are no organizations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so they often grow from rivalries or fear.” (p. 137) “Companies aren’t families. They’re battlefields in a civil war.” (p. 139) I was also fascinated with the chapter on consumer behavior. Did you know that almost everyone turns right after entering a retail establishment and that retailers stock their most profitable items on the right side of the store? (p. 157) Did you know that people’s buying habits change when they go through a major life event (marriage, having a child, divorce, moving)? (p. 162) And, in the facts are stranger than fiction department, Duhigg cites a company named Polyphonic HMI that statistically analyzes the mathematical characters of a song and predicts its popularity. (p. 167) Why is that strange? It’s because Norman Spinrad, a terrific science-fiction author, “predicts” it in his novel in the 1980s--Little Heroes. Sorry, Duhigg doesn’t cite Spinrad; that’s me. I was happy that Duhigg recounted a huge Polyphonic miscalculation. It also explained why I don’t listen to music on the radio very much: “Our brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how we manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound.” (p. 171) I actually listen to the radio for stimuli.The section on the habits of societies was particularly relevant to me because the first chapter dealt with churches, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Montgomery church and Rick Warren’s Saddleback Community Church. Starting with the idea of a social network of friendships and growing through informal ties (Duhigg calls them “weak ties”) and changing community habits, social habits turn on personal integrity and relationships. Duhigg pointed out how Rosa Park’s ties that transcended the social stratifications of the black community through her volunteer involvement with many groups on many levels enabled her to become the catalyst that she was (p. 184) The important insight that was new to me was: “The habits of peer pressure … often spread through weak ties. And they gain their authority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected patterns of your community, you risk losing your social standing.” (p. 189) Sadly, I was disappointed in the section on Rick Warren. The book makes it sound like Warren selected Saddleback Community from a long way away by citing Warren’s seminary education in Texas and work as a volunteer missionary in Japan. Strangely, it doesn’t mention the fact that Saddleback was only a little more 30 minutes drive from where Warren attended college in Riverside or that Warren’s father had been a professional minister in California prior to his retirement. I did like the emphasis on small groups as the key to creating a “sticky” environment that “…drew on already-existing social urges and patterns.” (p. 198) One significant section of the book was dedicated to the idea of whether we are responsible for our habits. By juxtaposing the tale of a gambler (if you listen to This American Life on public radio, you probably heard this story) who went to court with a major casino chain by insisting that the casino operators were responsible for her problem alongside that of a British subject who killed his wife during sleep terrors, Duhigg raises the issue but concludes by stating that he believes it is possible to change habits—any habits. The gambler protested that she just wanted to feel good at something (p. 208) and the killer protested that he honestly thought his wife was a male intruder assaulting his wife (p. 209).This section pointed out that, for example, sleepwalking is a reminder that sleep and wakefulness aren't that separate so that the brain can accomplish complex activities and nothing is guiding the brain except patterns. (pp. 210-211) Even more powerful are the behaviors described as “sleep terrors.” Sleep terrors are primitive neurological patterns (p.212). It even points out that a 2010 MRI study of gamblers discovered that, to pathological gamblers, brain activity was so high that it treated near misses as wins (p.220) when, in fact, they were losses. So, can such ingrained perceptions be changed? Duhigg cites William James’ decision to believe in free will as opposed to surrendering to suicide (p. 226). As James tried his 12 month long experiment, he discovered that habits were based upon exercising them (pp. 226-227) much like a well-folded paper or an old pair of well-creased slacks. And all of these great narratives point the reader toward the most useful part of the book, learning to change behavior by identifying the routine, figuring out the cue that triggers the routine and the craving underlying that cue by experimenting with different rewards (p. 230). If you can figure out what you really want and substitute a better routine to satisfy that craving, you will be well on your way toward changing that habit. That doesn’t mean you won’t fall off the wagon, but it means you will be on your way to shaping your actions by your will as opposed to ingrained behaviors.!121!Our local book club read this a few years ago.

The book presents a framework of understanding how habits work, and serves as a guide to show how to change habits.  “Once you choose who you want to be, believe you want to change, and it becomes real.” “Visualize the kind of person you would like to become, focus on one habit you would potentially develop, and transform that into what would become natural; requiring no effort or thinking.” “To modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habit’s routines and find alternatives. You must know you have control, and be self conscious enough to use it.” And hence, the  power of habit. So far so good. At this point I’m thinking “which one, which one!” I have a big list of those things I’d be more than happy to trash, and a bigger list of habits I’d like to build. According to Duhigg, the habit loop is made up of: cue → routine → reward. 

Let’s assume  I have a habit of reviewing books on goodreads. This habit of reviewing would be a cue, which makes up the routine: logging into my account, adding books and reviewing them. Apparently, habits (cue and routine) often require a reward. What would my reward in this scenario possibly be? A like? A comment? I hardly get any of those. Perhaps the reward comes from the deeper  craving  I have to read more books. Craving apparently is what drives the habit loop. Hence: Cue → Routine → Reward. The driver is the craving. And the extra spices are belief, and will-power. (Self-discipline increases will-power.)The beauty of realizing this power is that “at first, the change comes with difficulty, then it is done more easily, then semi-mechanically or with hardly any consciousness.” Our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing a keystone habit, like say, working out, can transform a person’s life, because with the habit of working out, one is going to simultaneously eat in a healthier way, possibly quit smoking, and live a better lifestyle which in turn could turn to a happier life.  EUREKA!  As based on the above, it would be fair to presume that due to my habit of writing reviews on goodreads, I will start to read more books, thanks to my craving, and this will in turn increase my reviews. I would have no idea what to do with those reviews, and so I might have a chance of reaching success and becoming famous by turning into a fraud replica of  Manny  who published a book about his reviews of books. And, to take it a little further, according to the habit loop, I may just as well meet the love of my life as a result of all this success, which would in turn stop me from eating so much ice cream.

On a serious note, Duhigg generously provides diverse examples to explain the habit loop. The examples range from personal experiences, such as depression/addiction (alcohol, gambling, overeating, etc) and memory-loss. And yet, some of the success stories got on my nerves at a certain point. I was a tad annoyed, early in the book, that he draws inspiration from the US Military and the ways through which habits are instilled in soldiers. Moreover, he includes a section on radio/music, concluding that the reason Outkast’s “Hey Ya” turned out to be such a hit despite the public’s initial disdain is because “the unfamiliar was made to seem familiar” through playing it with familiar songs. “If you dress a new something in an old habit,"" he explains, ""it is easier for the public to accept it.” (Which public?)He brings examples from sports games, shopping malls (like target) and coffee chains (like Starbucks) and others markets like Alcoa and Febreeze to display how the habit loop works. He mentions that ""companies predict and manipulate habits” and briefly remarks on how some customers do not like to be spied on for marketing purposes, yet it still seems as though Duhigg uses his examples as success stories. He does not seem to mind the data-mining and tracking of records or ethical standards so much, and focuses instead on how to make success out of this “secret”. [Speaking of which, did you know pregnant women are the biggest shoppers?] I was a little taken-aback by his corporate-success-mindedness and the ways in which he measures success. This would be a little too similar to the mind-set one finds in other self-help books, although I was hoping this one would be different. Unfortunately, most of these types of books seem to promote the sensation of becoming a driven, ambitious, goal-oriented, go-get-‘em tiger. I couldn’t help escape the idea that this man partly measures success by a person’s pay-check and exercise regimen.

That said, the book does have interesting viewpoints, particularly those related to how habits shape up societies. His take on habits within communities was eye-opening: He defines community as a giant collection of habits occurring among thousands of people that, depending on how they’re influenced, could result in violence or peace. He takes the example of Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama in 1955, and states that it was not just an act of defiance that sparked the boycott, but that the successful boycott was also due to her varying and influential social circles. In this section, as in other sections, attention is given to the importance of social standing, which comes with obligations. Apparently, it is not just our friends who strengthen our social networks, but the friends of our friends [“weak ties”] too have a role in improving our chances for finding employment and improve our social standing. One of the integral points that will stand out for me from this book is that our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing, or building, the most simple habit could have a direct impact on our mortal life. “However,"" Duhigg warns, ""there isn’t one formula. Individuals are different, habits are different, and cravings are different. What this book aspires to do is create a framework of understanding how a habit works, and serve as a guide to show how to change it.”!121!This was an interesting collection of research about habits and routines. The book felt Gladwellian in that it combined a variety of case studies while arguing a central theme, just as Malcolm Gladwell tends to do in his books. I think my favorite sections were the ones on Starbucks' training programs, Procter & Gamble's attempts to market Febreze, the safety record at Alcoa, the applications of Hit Song Science, and the historic Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. The overall theme is about how habits shape our lives, and it is possible to change bad habits for positive routines. The trick is in identifying what is cueing you to the bad habit, to experiment with positive rewards, and then make a plan for how to adjust your routine. This material was also explored in Gretchen Rubin's charming book, Better Than Before, and I enjoyed revisiting the topic. Recommended for those interested in human behavior and popular psychology/sociology.!121!This book claims to explain how new science can help us stop bad habits. The advice on habit change ultimately comes down to the appendix with the author's personal anecdote about trying to lose weight. The conclusion is obvious and it's not science; it's just some dude's story. People looking for books on using increased awareness of thought loops to change habits would be better served reading something about cognitive therapy or meditation. 

 

 Managing Your Mind: The Mental Fitness Guide Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday LifeMuch of what he is talking about with automatic responses to external cues goes back to century-old findings about Pavlov's dogs, and one of the people interviewed even describes what they're doing as ""Pavlovian"" so that's not new. The actual new science is the fashionable brain biology stuff, which is still not very practical. It's like taking apart your GPS after a road trip to see if you had a good vacation. Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless NeuroscienceOne of the most basic concepts in science is to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but the author mixes things up so much that it's like a fruit salad. Sleepwalking is a habit? Murder is a habit? Does ""habit"" mean anything??? Useful scientific advice on behavior change would tell us about controlled experiments of things that helped people. This book instead gives us lots of theories with a ""loop"" diagram that doesn't even make sense. According to the loop, you need an immediate reward to establish a long-term habit. But, for example, in the chapter about the Superbowl coach, nowhere is it explained what the immediate reward is for performing the correct behaviors thousands of times. Winning the game is the reward, but a losing team doesn't get that for years, if ever.!121!بيقولك (بس كلام أكيد يعني) لو جبت فار وحطيته في متاهة زي اللي في الصورة دي كده، وبعدين فجاة مع صوت الكليك شلت الحاجز اللي بيفصل بين الجزء اللي الفار محبوس فيه وبين الجزء اللي في حته الشوكولاته ... الفار هيبدأ يجري علي كل ركن ويشمشم في كل جتى وهياخد وقت طويل على ما هيوصل لنهاية المتاهة وياكل حتى الشوكولاته .. في المرة التانية اللي هتعمل فيها نفس التجربة لنفس الفار، هتلاحظ انه بقا اسرع وبقا بيضيع وقت اقل في التسكع في جنبات المتاهة لحد ما يوصل لحته الشوكولاته..في المرة التلاتين، هتتفاجأ! لأنك هتلاقي الفار بياخدها جري من مجرد ما بيسمع صوت الكليك لحد ما يوصل للشوكولاته ويقضم قضمه ...التجربة دي قام بيها علماء في MIT في أوائل التسعينات من القرن الماضي. بس هم مكتفوش بمراقبة سلوك الفار، لكن قاموا بتثبيت أقطاب/سلوك في دماغ الفار علشان يراقبوا النشاط العصبي الملازم للسلوك داه ... وزي ما سلوك الفار اختلف في الأيام الأولى عن الأيام الأخيرة ، برضه لاحظوا اختلاف مقابل في نشاط في المخ في الآخر عن الأول ... كان ايه بقا الاختلاف داه؟في الأيام الأولى كان المخ بيفضل نشط في اعلى مستوياته طوال الفترة من أول صوت الكليك حتى الحصول على قطعة الشيكولاته ..في الأيام الأخيرة وبعد التكرار والتكرار، الوضع اختلف ، كان المخ في أعلى مستويات نشاطه عند نقطتين فقط : مع صوت الكليك ( البداية) ، وعند الحصول على الشيكولاته (النهاية)... المثال بتاع الفار داه مثال جيد جدا لتحول النشاط الواعي إلى روتين .. وكلمة روتين تعني ان بقت بتتعمل من غير الحاجة لنشاط ذهني عالي، داه غير إنها بتتعمل باستمرار، وصعب ان يحصل خطأ في أدائها .. وتم وضع فرض جيد لتركيب العادات من 3 أجزاء بتكون حلقة : إشارة البدأ، والروتين، والمكافأة في النهاية . زي ما في الصورة التالية:وموضوع اكتساب العادات داه راجل لتركيب بدائي في مركز المخ تقريبا اسمه basal ganglia وكلمة بدائي معناها انه مشترك مع أنواع كتير من الحيوانات وأنه ـ وداه الأهم ـ مش بيعتمد على عمليات معقدة في المخ، وبيتساوى فيه الناس تقريبا من ناحية المقدرة العقلية ..الكلام داه تأكد ليهم من خلال حالة مرضية شهيرة كانت مرت بعدوى فيروسية في الجهاز العصبي والمخ ، وبعد العلاج كان جزء كبير من المخ تدمر ، لدرجة ان أي احداث حصلت بعد المرض ثم العلاج كانت بتتمسح من الذاكرة في ظرف دقايق، ومع ذلك كان المريض ، واللي اشتهر في كتب الطيب ب EP ، قادر انه يكتسب عادات جديدة فقط من التكرار والتكرار والتكرار إلى أن تتحول العادة إلى روتين.. إمكانية تحول فعل ما من نشاط بيحتاج مجهود عقلي إلى عادة روتين ، ليه فوايد هي: بتوفر طاقة المخ لأنشطة تانية أكثر تعقيدا، وانك وفقا لمفهوم العادة هتكون ضامن انك هتواظب على الفعل داه علطول مادام توفرت شروط معينة ... والشروط المعينة دي هنعرفها في مراجعة باقي الكتاب فانتظرونا :D!121!3.5 *!121!یکم- فردی به ویروس مغزی مبتلا می شود؛ ویروسی که کارش خوردن بافت مغز است. در نهایت پزشکان به این نتیجه میرسند که باید بافت آلوده را خارج کرد. با��تی که آلوده شده ، شامل حافظه بود و لذا پزشکان نگران از اینکه او بخش وسیعی از قابلیت هایش را از دست بدهد به همسرش هشدار می دهند که از او مراقبت کند. همسرش برای حفظ سلامتی جسمانی وی ، هر روز راس ساعت معینی او را از مسیر مشخصی به پیاده روی می برد و به خانه بازمیگرداند. یک روز در حالی که او از همسرش غافل می شود، وی از خانه خارج میشود. زن وحشت زده می شود. چرا؟ زیرا همسرش اکنون مردی بی حافظه است پس پیش بینی پزشکی این ست که وی به قطع مسیر بازگشت را به یاد نخواهد آورد و گم خواهد شد.مرد پس از مدت معمول پیاده روی هرروزه به خانه باز میگردد. علت چیست؟ پژوهشگران شگفت زده می شوند! علت را باید در ویژگی دیگری جست و جو کرد: عادتدوم- داستان مرد ِ بی حافظه ، عادت را در کانون توجهات پژوهشگران قرار میدهد. به راستی عادت چیست؟ چه فرآیندی منجر به شکل گیری عادت ها می شود؟ آیا عادت ها قابل تغییر اند؟ و .... پژوهش ها به نتیجه میرسد: عادت ها متشکل از یک سیکل سه مرحله ای ست : سرنخ، جریان عادی و پاداش. یک سیگاری را در نظر بگیرید : دیدن سیگار همان سرنخ یا محرّک است، جریان عادی حلقه ی شکل گیری ِ عادت با دست یافتن به سیگار و کشیدن ِ آن ادامه یافته و در نهایت پاداش که چیزی جزء لذت افزایش نیکوتین در خون نیست!سوم- همه ی ما مجموعه ای از عادت ها هستیم. عادت های هیچگاه از بین نمی روند و برای همیشه در بخش کوچکی در وسط مغز آدمی ثبت و رمزگذاری میشوند. عادت ها را می توان جایگزین کرد، اما آنها برای همیشه در مغز باقی می مانند. راز جایگزینی عادت در حفظ سرنخ و پاداش و تلاش برای جایگزین کردن جریان عادی است. فردی در یک اداره را در نظر بگیرید که پس از آنکه خسته و بی حوصله از کار میشود کشوی میز ِ خود را باز کرده و خوراکی ای می بیند و با خوشحالی خود را به خوردن آن مشغول می نماید. روز بعد در حالی که پس از کار احساس خمودگی می کند... دیلینگ!!... چیزی در مغزش صدا میکند: در کشویت را باز کن و باز هم خوراکی و رهایی از خستگی و بی حوصلگی ... پس از چند ماه حلقه ی عادت شگل گرفته است: بی حوصلگی(سرنخ) – تلاش برای یافتن و خوردن خوراکی (جریان عادی) – و درنهایت رهایی از بی حوصلگی با مشغول شدن به خوردن (پاداش)... و البته معضلی که فرد با آن مواجهه شده است: اضافه وزن! در این جا کافی ست در زمان بی حوصلگی(سرنخ) از پیش میز خود بلند شده و چرخی در محل کار خود بزند و یا در اینترنت تاب بخورد (جریان عادی جایگزین) تا دوره ی بی حوصلگی اش بگذرد(پاداش).چهارم- عادت ها پس از شکل گیری به صورت کاملا غیرارادی و ناآگانه و البته خودکار صورت می گیرند. برای همین است که فردی که رانندگی را فراگرفته و آن را به عادت تبدیل نموده است می تواند فارغ از استرس ها و نیاز به توجه کامل ابتدای دوره ی آموزش اش ، در حین رانندگی در یک بحث فلسفی داغ با همراه اش شرکت کند!پنجم- در جنگ جهانی دوم، دولت آمریکا مقدار زیادی از ذخایر گوشت بومی ملی را برای سربازان خود در اروپا فرستاد به طوری که در رستوران های آمریکا از گوشت اسب استفاده می کردند. بازار سیاه شگل گرفت و دولت از این نگران بود که اگر جنگ طولانی شود مردم از گرسنگی بمیرند. دولت با تاکید بر اینکه گوشت و چربی به اندازه تانک و هواپیما مهم است از جامعه شناسان، انسان شناسان و روان شناسان ده ها کشور دعوت کرد تا موضوعی را بررسی کنند: چگونه می توان مردم را قانع کرد دیگر اعضای چهارپایان را نیز بخورند و خانم های خانه دار به همسران و فرزندانشان جگر، دل، قلوه، مغز و دیگر اعضای غنی از پروتیین را بدهند؟!! مردم حاضر بودند از گرسنگی بمیرند تا اینکه بخواهند زبان وسیرابی بخورند!! در نهایت تلاش پژوهشگران به این نتیجه رسید: برای تغییر رژیم غدایی مردم کافی ست مسایل نامتعارف را آشنا ساخت. پس باید عادت های جدید را در بین عادت های معمول استتار کرد! لذا به خانم های خانه دار آموزش دادند که چه کنند تا ظاهر، طعم ومزه و بوی این غذاها به غذاهای لذیذ گذشتشان شباهت یابد. بزودی خانم ها نامه ای از طرف ِ دولت با عنوان ""همسرتان عاشق استیک قلوه خواهد شد"" و شامل دستور عمل پخت استیک قلوه دریافت کردند. طبق یک مطالعه مصرف امعا و احشا در آمریکا در طول جنگ جهانی دوم 32 درصد افزایش یافت و طی یک دهه بعد نه تنها قلوه به غذای اصلی مردم تبدیل شد که خوردن امعا و احشا مخصوص مراسمات خاص و نشانه رفاه خانواده های مصرف کننده به شمار می رفت!!ششم- حوزه ی نفوذ عادت بسیار بسیار فراتر از آن است که می اندیشید. از قریب به اتفاق رفتارهای ما گرفته تا جنبش های اجتماعی، از کنش های سیاسی گرفته تا جریان های فرهنگی، اقتصاد، تبلیغات، سنت ها، فرهنگ ها و همه حوزه های همگرا و واگرای مرتبط به آدمی ، همه وهمه متاثر از عادت های فردی یا جمعی اند. عادت ها مهّم اند. اگر ساختار و فرآیند شکل گیری شان را بشناسید می توانید – بسته به نوع آنها- با صرف زمان و تلاش آن ها را تغییر دهید.هفتم- کتابی درگیرکننده، روشنگر و امیدبخش است . بخوانیدش!121!Expect a video about this marvelous book soon.!121!While this book kept popping in my feeds and conversations since many years, somehow got to reading it only now.This is a well-researched book. The underlying premise is a good one – we carry out many actions as a result of habits rather than by careful evaluation, it is the way our brain develops. By recognizing how this happens, we have an opportunity to change our habits. The format of how we act out our habits is a simple loop of a cue which triggers anticipation, after which we follow-up a familiar good feeling pattern of action, which results in a reward we crave for. If we can recognize the cues and the rewards we crave, we can make substitutions in our actions to derive an equivalent satisfaction with some other action. Another key requirement is strengthening belief that this can be done. Some keystone habits can have a cascading trigger of effects across many dimensions and this is very well explained. Most of the examples are good ones though in a few cases apparently, I have different cues or times have changes. Eg: Pepsodent really took off and in fact more people starting including paste in their med-kits and brushing as a result – the message “there is a film which forms around our teeth and Pepsodent helps you get over it”, and the tingling sensation most pastes now leave in your mouth. There are other good examples – why some people are unable to resist the urge to gamble, intake drugs or smoke. There are others – how Target customizes its coupons (including marketing to pregnant women subtly), the Starbucks induction program to enable employees to handle all kinds of customers, Febreze – odour neutralizer, the ‘Hey Ya’ song which was marketed for success.This is a very readable book – it has a good mix of neuroscience, research and some interesting stories. The appendix with tips on changing habits should actually be part of the main section itself. Some of the neuroscience quoted is still evolving though. Also, while the habit loop is abstracted to a nice simple flow, it does not ask a key question – what if your underlying reward craving is in itself flawed/misdirected? How can you graduate your thinking to a higher purpose and form habits which address that?An intellectually stimulating read, which I recommend.I have this habit of accumulating far more books than I can read. Will I now be able to beat that habit? I think not – but then I do not yet have the belief that I can do it 😊!121!Habits, both good and bad, govern our life. But it's very difficult for us to start a new one or break a bad one. If we are more aware of why and how habits are formed, then we'll be able to control them. That's exactly what ""The Power of Habit"" tries to accomplish!This well-researched book consults academic studies, interviews with many scientists and executives, and research conducted at various companies. I had heard some lessons from this book by watching a few YouTube videos, but reading it was such a fun experience!One of the most useful takeaways from this book is that habits are powerful but also delicate. They can be formed outside our consciousness or with our intention. They can form without our permission but can be reshaped by us. Old habits never disappear, but we can change them by altering the cues and rewards.The book is split into three parts. The first part focuses on the habits of individuals, second on habits of successful organizations, and third on habits of societies. It was interesting to read about the research and real-life examples of how habits work on three levels.This book isn't a detailed guide on how to form habits but focuses more on the research aspects and the nitty-gritty of habits, right from how to form them and factors that influence them. I highly enjoyed reading about the habits of organization and societies as it was something new to me. I learned some useful information on habits I'll summarize in another post!All in all, it's a book worth reading!INSTAGRAM!121!این کتاب یکی از چهار/پنج کتابی‌ست که من در زمینه  موفقیت و رشد شخصی  و موضوعات مرتبط با آن در طول حدود ده سال اخیر مطالعه کرده‌ام، آن قبلی‌ها که هیچ کدام حتی ذره‌ای هم برایم آموزنده و جالب نبودند، و معمولا هم نیمه‌کاره رها شدند، اما این یکی کمی تا اندکی خوب بود و تا آخر خوانده شد درباره کتاب قدرت عادتنخست. من به طور کلی با فضای کتاب‌های حوزه موفقیت مشکل دارم (دلیل آن را خواهم گفت) و هیچ‌گاه هم نتوانستم با آن‌ها به قولی حال کنم. پس بی‌تردید گزارش من جهت‌گیری دارددوم. گذشته از این قضاوت‌های شخصی من! این کتاب البته با فضای رایج کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت متفاوت بود و به همین دلیل هم تا حدی از آن خوشم آمد! در واقع این کتاب ساختاری تقریبا علمی دارد و بیش از آنکه درباره موفقیت باشد، درباره تلاش برای بهبود رفتارها و عملکردهای شخصی هست و از این رو می‌تواند در جای خود مفید هم باشد به طور مشخص ایدۀ اصلی کتاب چنین استبسیاری از رفتارها و کنش‌های روزانه ما ناشی از عادت‌های ماست. کنش‌های ناشی از عادت، دربردارندۀ سه بخش هستند: سرنخ، روتین، پاداش. نکته مهم دربارۀ چرخۀ عادت این است که ما در طول این چرخه از کنش‌های خود، آگاه نیستیم و بدون تصمیم‌گیری و سنجش و گزینش عمل می‌کنیم. به عنوان مثال فرآیند رانندگی یکی از این عادت‌هاست. نکته جالب در مورد چرخۀ عادت این است که در این چرخه‌ها می‌توان یک روتین جدید را جایگزین یک روتین دیگر کرد. بنابراین می‌توان با همان سرنخ و پاداش قبلی، یک روتین دیگر را جایگزین یک روتین مضر کرد. با این ترفند می‌توان بسیاری از عادت‌های نادرس�� همچون اعتیاد را از بین برد. البته در این میان برای ادامۀ چرخۀ عادت ِ روتین جدید، به یک عامل دیگر نیز نیازمندیم:  باور یا اعتقاد.  در واقع باور به اینکه می‌توانیم تغییر کنیم و می‌توانیم عادات نادرست خود را از بین ببریم یک تحلیل کلی درباره کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت  همانگونه که در بالا اشاره کردم، این کتاب درباه بهبود رفتارهای شخصی است و از این رو با سایر کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت (کتاب‌های با عناوینی همچون یک شبه میلیونر شوید یا سه ساعته فیلسوف شوید و غیره) بسیار متفاوت است. با این حال با توجه به این که کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت این روزها به شدت همه‌گیر شده‌اند در اینجا تحلیل و نقد کوتاهی از این کتاب‌ها می‌آورم. هر چند که این تحلیل چندان ارتباطی با کتاب قدرت عادت ندارداساسا منطقی که در پس کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت نهفته است از بن و بنیاد ایراد دارد! اگر از گونه‌های مبتذل‌تر منطق آن‌ها (مثلا اینکه هر چه را که آرزو کنید و با تمام وجود خواهان آن باشید به واقعیت تبدیل می‌شود) بگذریم، این منطق به ساده‌ترین شکل چنین است: «هرکسی می‌تواند با تلاش شخصی خود موفق شود». این منطق به نظر من منطقی به شدت بی بنیاد و فریب‌دهنده است، چرا که می‌خواهد همه چیز را به خودِ فرد ارتباط دهد و سایر موارد موثر محیطی همچون شرایط سیاسی، اجتماعی ، اقتصادی، فرهنگی و غیره و به ویژه فاصله‌ طبقاتی و تقسیم ناعادلانه فرصت‌ها که ناشی از نظام‌های سرمایه‌سالار است را پنهان کند‍! در واقع نخستین نتیجه‌ای که بی‌درنگ از این منطق بیرون می‌آید چنین است: اگر آقای ایکس امروز میلیاردر است، این ثروت صرفا ناشی از تلاش و توانایی شخصی خود اوست و نه ناشی از شرایط خانوادگی خاص او و ثروتی که از پدرش به او رسیده و هزاران رانت و لابی و فرصت نابرابر و غیره؛ و اگر شمایی که امروز محتاج پول توجیبی ماهانه خودت هستی در این شرایط ناگور به سر میبری باز هم این شرایط صرفا ناشی از ناتوانی و بی‌لیاقتی و تلاش نکردن خود شخص ِ تو است و بس! و جامعه و شرایط و فرصت‌های اقتصادی و سیاست و فرهنگ و خانواده و هزار عامل کوچک و بزرگ دیگر هیچ نقشی در این بدبختی تو ندارند! خنده دار نیست؟؟ به باور من اتفاقا این منطق را بیش از همه همان آدم‌هایی که با بهره‌گیری از هزاران دوپینگ توانسته‌اند به ثروت و قدرت برسند تبلیغ می‌کنند! چرا که خودشان هم به خوبی می‌دانند که دوپینگ کرده‌اند و از این رو فرافکنی می‌کنند تا دوپینگ آن‌ها لو نرود. اما از این نقد کلی که بگذریم، فضای این‌گونه کتاب‌ها نیز به شدت فریب‌دهنده و به دور از واقعیت است، و بیش از هر چیز فرد را از واقعیت‌های زندگانی و جامعه جدا می‌سازد و در رویاهای دروغین غوطه‌ور می‌کند. افزون بر این ها، از نظر محتوا و به تعبیری حرف اصلی و لب کلام نیز فقری عجیب و غریب در این کتاب‌ها به چشم می‌خورد! به گونه‌ای که گاه می‌توان کل حرف حساب کتاب را در یک پاراگراف آورد! حال آن‌که نویسنده صدها صفحه را برای تکرار همین یک پارگراف سیاه کرده است! در تحلیل نهایی بر این باورم که این کتاب‌ها راست می‌گویند! آن‌ها راه موفقیت هستند! البته راه موفقیت برای نویسنده کتاب‌ها و نه خواننده آن‌ها! چرا که نویسنده با نوشتن و فروش همین کتاب‌ها پول خوبی به جیب می‌زند! البته نه در کشور ما، بلکه در کشورهای دارای قانون کپی رایت که بهای یک جلد از همین کتاب‌های موفقیت گاهی به صد تا دویست دلار می‌رسد جوینده و پاینده باشیدامین درستی!121!How do some of us wake up for 6 a.m. jogs every day? What leads people to develop gambling addictions? Why do people brush their teeth every day while never remembering to wear sunscreen? Charles Duhigg answers these questions and more in The Power of Habit, a well-researched book on what motivates us to make the decisions we do in everyday life and in business.Duhigg's background as a reporter shows in this book. He does a good job of stringing together a wide variety of topics to fit his thesis that revolves around habit, and for the most part he writes about the cue-routine-reward cycle. To illustrate how that pattern works and what we can do to change it, Duhigg explores ideas like smoking addiction, sleepwalking, Target tracking down pregnant women, and more. His writing shines when he compares the man who murdered his wife while asleep to the women who lost an enormous sum of money to compulsive gambling: I still find myself thinking about the neurological and moral implications of the distinction he presents.However, the writing in this book faltered at times. In certain sections Duhigg would break up anecdotes and combine them in odd, confusing ways. Sometimes he selected scenarios that did not align too well with his arguments, like his exploration of how ""Hey-Ya"" became popular. The book as a whole veered more toward reporting than research, so bear that in mind if you decide to pick it up.Overall, a decent read I wanted a little more from when I finished. Recommended to those who want to get their feet wet when it comes to habit formation or psychology that deals with motivation. I will end with a quote from The Power of Habit that stood out to me in a good way:That, in some ways, is the point of this book. Perhaps a sleepwalking murderer can plausibly argue that he wasn't aware of his habit, and so he doesn't bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people's lives - how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, attention, and money - those are habits that we know exist. And once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom - and the responsibility - to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work.!121!I almost never refer to a book as one ""everyone should read."" People have such wide-ranging interests and value sets that whenever anyone asks me for that kind of one-size-fits-all book - and they often do, given I have a nonfiction-focused YouTube channel - I resist giving an answer. But if forced, I always suggest this book since habits are something all of us have. They influence our lives in dramatic ways and in The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg first explains the science of how habits work in our brains and then goes on to demonstrate how they work in personal, organizational, and social capacities using fascinating anecdotes ranging from how a CEO turned around a struggling steel-producing company through focusing on safety standards, to how a man was found not guilty of murdering his wife because he was in the midst of a sleep terror.I've read many books that blend science and anecdote before and since reading (and now, rereading) this book and no one does it as smoothly and engagingly as Duhigg. You'll be entertained and you'll learn things that you can immediately start applying to your own life. This is one of the best and most widely-appealing nonfiction books out there. Don't miss it!!121!I feel like I’ve just climbed Mt. Rainier. Why you ask? I finished a non-fiction book!So, I started this climbing excursion because I have bad habits. We all do most of the time. My bad habits are eating unhealthy food, drinking too much wine, not getting enough exercise or procrastinating at work. My hubby and I thought, let’s figure out WHY since we both have bad habits we want to stop. We started this buddy read in February. February?! And you're just finishing it? Now don’t let that sway you that it took over two months to finish this book. It’s not a bad read, I just took my time with it, it's non-fiction and of course, I read books in between. ;) hahahaSo, did it answer some of my questions? Will I put down the bag of Cheetos next time I drink too much wine?! Yeah, I think it did.The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business helped me understand that stopping a bad habit isn’t the easiest thing to do. Don't beat yourself up about it. They become routine, habitual and ingrained in your life. They are caused by stress, emotions and going back to creature comforts. The book addresses that one of the ways to break a bad habit is to replace it with a substitute. It’s one of the ways to make a lasting change.Technically, this book isn’t bad. The author jumps around a bit with stories, starting one narrative and then going to another. Depending on the subject matter, I was okay with this. When I was really into the subject matter, it annoyed the hell out of me.This book is also a good analysis about why people like what they do, buy from a certain store or buy merchandise. The businesses that are smart, they have tapped into the emotion of advertising and habits. This part of the book was fascinating and was interesting material to read. And it confirmed that a lot of our bad habits are subliminal because of ads, commercials and radio.Why 4 stars? I didn’t really need that much business data and could have used a bit more personal.We are creatures of habit and it’s really on to you and whether you can make the change or not. Belief plays a big role in our daily success. I hope that I can use some of the tips in this book to finally implement some changes.!121!A book of three halves. (What, I don't do maths.) The first third gets right into the way habits work (cue, behaviour, reward) and explains them really well--including why it's incredibly hard to break a habit but much easier to redirect one (identify your cue and reward, change the behaviour that links them). It's one of those super enlightening books that makes you want to tell everyone you meet about it, incredibly useful. Lots of stories about habits, good and bad, and people who changed them, and the things that make it easier to change (depressingly often includes some equivalent of 'divine revelation'). I really wanted more on the habit cascade thing, whereby making one small change can trigger a series of changes. The second part is about the 'habits' of companies which is pretty interesting, but also kind of horrible in how corporate minded it is (developing healthy company habits is great because your workers spend more time at work!). The third part is more society-wide, with particular focus on a woman who sued casinos for their predatory marketing directed at compulsive gamblers, which ends with the author's agreement that it was her fault for not breaking her gambling habit, not the casinos for actively exploiting addiction to bankrupt vulnerable people, which...okay, we'll have to agree to differ on whether predatory corporates are good, I guess!The first third is really great, but the capitalist running doggery did not appeal to me. Also the author has a slightly annoying habit of nesting stories. But the first third is super worth reading, best analysis of habits I've yet encountered.!121!معلومتان جديدتان مهمتان جدًا ستعرفهما بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب المعجزة:أولًا : الإنسان عندما يقوم بأي فعل فإنه يفكر مسبقًا فيما سيعود عليه من فائدة من فعله.ثانيًا : الإنسان عندما يقوم بفعل ما بشكل تكراري يص��ح هذا الأمر عادة عنده.لحظة!من قال أنهما ""جديدتان""؟أليس كل شخص يقوم بالفعل بالبحث عن الفائدة في كل ما يفعله؟ هل ننتظر مثلًا أن نجد شخصًا ما يقوم بفعل ما وهو يدرك أنه سيكون ضارًا به أو لن يعود عليه بأي فائدة أو متعة أو خير بأي شكل؟!!! أليس هذا بتعريف ""الجنون""؟؟؟ هل الكاتب يوجه الكتاب إلى المجانين؟؟وماذا عن تحول ""الفعل التكراري"" إلى عادة؟ أليس تعريف كلمة ""عادة"" أصلًا هو ""فعل يقوم به الإنسان بشكل دوري""؟! ما الإضافة الجبارة التي أتى بها الكاتب؟!! إذن فماذا لدينا هنا؟كتاب من مئتي صفحة من أجل إخبارنا بشيء كل شخص يدركه بالفعل!!فقط لنتخيل أن يقوم شخص ما بعمل عملية ""مط"" للمعلومتين ""العظيمتين المجهولتين"" السابق ذكرهما في مئتي صفحة! ما الذي ننتظره؟ حشوًا ثم حشوًا ثم حشوًا!وهذا بالفعل ما ستجده.. فالكاتب يقوم بتجميع عدة قصص مسلية من الصحف والجرائد ويحكيها في الكتاب.. طبعًا لا تسأل هل لهذه القصص علاقة بما يريد الكتاب أن يقوله أو لا.. فالسؤال لغير الله مذلة يا أخي! وإن كنت مصرًا على الذنب فالإجابة لا .. فما بين قصة عن طبيب أخطأ في عملية وما بين قصة عن صاحب ستاربكس الذي اشتراها عندما كانت خاسرة.. لن تستطيع أبدًا أن تصل إلى أي شيء يريد أن يقوله الكاتب!هل يريد أن يقول أن الشركات الكبيرة تهتم بوضع ثقافة داخلية لموظفيها؟ ياله من اكتشاف! ومن قال أن الشركات الكبيرة ليست لديها ثقافة ما؟! هل يريد أن يقول أن الإنسان عندما يغير عادة ما فإن هذا يؤثر على حياته؟ ياله من إكتشاف آخر! فطالما أن الإنسان قام بتغيير أي عادة ما فطبقًا لتعريف ""التغيير"" فقد غير حياته!! هل يريد أن ينصحنا بالطريقة الأمثل لاكتساب العادات؟؟ أعتقد أن الكاتب قد فشل تمامًا في هذا لأنه -وعلى حد تعبيره واعترافه- فكل إنسان حالة مختلفة والعادات لها ظروفها المختلفة وبالتالي لا توجد طريقة واحدة!!!إذن ما الذي ستخرج منه بعد إنتهائك من الكتاب؟آه.. هذا صحيح تمامًا :""كتب التنمية البشرية أكبر عملية نصب منظمة في التاريخ""!!121!The Power of Habit examines behaviors you may not even know you have and hands you the tools to make lasting change at home, at work and in your community... if you want it.""Each chapter revolves around a central argument: Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work."" prologue xviiFirst, author Charles Duhigg goes into what makes a habit at the biological level.""Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often."" pgs 17-18Duhigg describes how the brain creates a ""habit loop"" through cues, routines and rewards. These three elements feed on themselves until an ingrained habit is made. And, once it is there, it takes very little to upkeep.That's good news and bad news, because it works the same way for healthy and unhealthy habits.""But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making."" pg 20The ""golden rule"" for changing a habit, Duhigg says, is to keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that leads to them. It sounds simple, but everyone is different with different motivations. So, it takes a bit of self awareness to discover what those unique cues and rewards are for you. But, once you know your triggers and motivations, that's when the fun begins of crafting a new routine.I found this book to be absolutely fascinating. It's also making me question the habits I've picked up in my own life. Am I certain that they are ones I want to continue? I can think of a few that could use a bit of tweaking. And now I know how.""This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be."" pg 271Let's cultivate the good ones then.!121!This book is informative and has a lot of interviews and examples to prove his theory of building habits. Habits are like automatic programming in our brains. Normally, we don't think when we are executing our habits.According to the author, a habit is a formula our brain automatically follows: ""When I see CUE, I will do ROUTINE to get a REWARD.""We have to find out what is the CUE then we change our ROUTINE therefore we can change our habits.Nevertheless, if you want to motivate changing your habit, I recommend you to read Atomic Habits by James Clear. His book is easier to understand and it motivates us to change habits.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Audiobook']"
Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men (Hardcover),Caroline Criado Pérez,4.35,113877,2019,"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates the shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women​, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.","I really dislike conspiracy theories – in fact, few things make me angrier. The reason is that a conspiracy generally involves people plotting and planning and those people who are assumed to have the power to bring the conspiracy into effect generally have been shown in history to be pretty stupid – in fact, far too stupid to do the conspiracy and keep quiet about it. Conspiracy theories also tend to involve improbable leaps of faith along the way, you know, like the one that the US government was involved in bringing down the Twin Towers at 9/11. These theories become so convoluted and improbable that eventually it would be easier to just blame aliens.But the real reason I hate conspiracy theories is that a conspiracy implies that the bad shit that happens in our world is hidden from us by powerful elites – and the fact is that the really, really bad shit in our world isn’t hidden from us at all. I think conspiracy theories have an appeal to us because they basically pardon us for our inaction. How were we supposed to do something about stuff we didn’t even know was happening? – Damn you, you evil conspirators! But really, whether it be climate change, third world debt, HIV/AIDS, American gun laws, the Iraq war, the slaughter and man-made famine in Yemen, the pollution of our oceans, referring to fossil fuels as ‘freedom fuels’ (no, I didn’t make that one up, even though I wish I had https://www.sbs.com.au/news/us-rebran...) – none of this is hidden from us. None of this needs a conspiracy to explain it. All of the murder, all of the destruction, all of the ‘let’s end all life on the planet for a bit more money’ is done in broad daylight with our noses pushed right up into it. And all of this is a million times more terrifying than the idea that the US government blew up a couple of buildings. Yet we watch our nightly news, yawn, roll over and fall back to sleep.This book is about one of those non-conspiracies we sort of know about but do stuff all to fix. The way we treat women is so breathtakingly appalling it would be nice if there was some sort of conspiracy theory involved here to relieve us of our complicity. This book argues that how women are treated isn’t really due to the evil patriarchy, a bit like the Elders of Zion plotting the overthrow of the Tzar, but that how our society ignores women makes how they are treated inevitable. It says that many of the reasons that women are so badly treated in our society is because most of the people with power, most of the people who get to make the decisions that make a difference in the world, are men – and it isn’t that men consciously go out of their way to make life shit for women (even though you would have to wonder sometimes) but rather, they do this because they are men, and as such they design the world to work for them. And when that world simply doesn’t work for women, these men don’t even notice because they simply don’t inhabit the same world that women inhabit. There is no conspiracy theory required – just neglect, self-interest, and perhaps a little dose of wilful blindness based on those with power focused solely on their own needs.The author blames a lot of the problems here on gaps in the data. There were lots of things I didn’t know. I didn’t know that car crash dummies are mostly ‘male’ – particularly driver dummies – and that they are based on what you could call ‘middle man’, about the average in terms of weight and height and everything else. I didn’t know that many drugs that are often almost exclusively given to women (think antidepressants say) are often almost exclusively trialled on men. I didn’t know that Viagra could potentially help cure PMT, but that the drug companies don’t want to put it through the clinical trials to do this since it is such a profitable drug that if they find out it causes problems in women it might cause problems that would kill the goose that laid the golden egg. There are lots of examples here of instances of things like men getting free condoms and women not having access to sanitary products that just make your blood boil. When it is pointed out it is hard to not come to the conclusion that we men really are arseholes.This book gets depressing very quickly. There is just case after case of things that made me say, ‘Oh, for god’s sake – who makes this shit up?’ Like how women are often excluded from drug trails altogether because they have hormones that change over the month and so that might make testing the drug a bit more difficult. Which is a bit like designing trousers for men assuming they don’t have penises because, well, it just makes it easier. And before you laugh, the author gives at least half a dozen examples where things are poorly designed to fit women because women have the audacity to grow breasts. This is an infuriating book. We are effectively murdering women – in fact, often we are actually murdering women and too often we do this by paying no attention at all to the physiological, social, cultural and power differences that exist between the sexes. There was a bit early on in this book where I got a bit worried. She started to discuss the problems associated with women in academia – what has become my world – and while all of these problems are very, very real, I was worried that this book might end up a kind of ‘glass ceiling’ book. And after reading Feminism for the 99% A Manifesto – I’m going to have to get around to reviewing that eventually – I’m worried about ‘feminist’ books that only notice the issues that impact rich, white women. But this book brought intersectionality into its analysis too – you know, if you are black and female, you might want to travel out of the US to give birth, I’m just saying.This book ought to make you angry. 	Not least because the answer to many of the problems identified would simply involve listening to women. I knew many of the things discussed here. For instance, that many more women than men died in the tsunami in 2004. The reason? Women look after children and old people, women are often in locations where they can’t hear the warnings signals, women are less likely to learn to swim, women are less likely to learn to climb trees, women are constrained by ‘modesty’ in clothes that make escaping rising water almost impossible – and if they do escape they are likely to be raped and possibly bashed by men. If you are not made angry by this book you have no humanity left. But the solution is often also painfully simple. We need to listen to women. We need to place them in positions of power. We need to involve them in decision making processes that impact them. I know, radical ideas, but we might as well start big and work down from there.The instance that will stay with me from this book was about public transport – it had just never occurred to me. Most public transport users are women. Men drive cars, women catch the bus. But public transport systems are designed by men. So, they are designed to radiate out from the centre of cities – much like fingers splayed out from the palm of a hand. Which is great for men going to work and then back home again – but not so great for women who might need to get the kids off to school, check on their aging parents, and then work in three part-time jobs that are close enough to home to collect the kids again from school, all of which might not be in a direct line into the centre of the city. Public transport systems are designed by men to suit the needs of men, but are mostly used by women, and so often don’t meet the needs of the majority of its users. Shit like that has really got to stop.Thanks Avolyn for recommending this to me.!121!Do not read this if you are suffering from high blood pressure, because it is absolutely rage inducing. However EVERYONE should read this at some point, it looks at things that I had never even considered, genuinely brilliant.Second Read- so.... my Feminist bookclub have this on the list, so gave it a reread- just as goddamn rage inducing on the second read.!121!Incredibly enlightening... and frustrating.!121!I don't know who would possibly want a man's opinion on a book about the problems with male default bias, but... here's my review.This is essentially a collection of statistics which entail how systems made by men and for men are minimizing and marginalizing the other 50% of the population. It does this by breaking the statistics down into chapter-spanning categories and creating a cohesive narrative to explain how all of these events are related and come back to the same basic problem.I would recommend this book to any man who identifies as ""not sexist."" Because this makes it clear that even treatment that men believe is fair, un-sexist, and in the best interest of women, is still entirely subjective to their inherently male worldview. This book really shook up my views on what equal consideration for both men and women should look like. To anyone who thinks, ""Why can't women be more like men,"" or that women should follow the exact same rules and be given the exact same treatment, read this book. You will develop a very thorough understanding of how, both now and historically, one-size-fits-all rules generally conflate what favors society as a whole with what favors the men who write them. Consequently, equal consideration to both men and women often requires unequal treatment, because, surprising as this may be to many men, women don't necessarily have the same needs.I listened to the audiobook, which happens to be narrated by the author. This, I think, was a huge benefit, as the tones and inflections of the author convey the feeling and intended meaning of every word. This does, of course, mean that the author's (understandably) frustrated bias often comes through in the subtext, but I think that's important in order to glean not only the data and statistics, but an actual woman's perspective on them. It doesn't blur the actual data being presented, so I think the book is better for it.My one complaint is that the information in this book was borderline overwhelming. A majority of the content entails half-hour cascades of one statistic after another, and I found that my proverbial eyes would glaze over occasionally and I would have to back up and try again. This is unfortunately inevitable, as there are only so many ways to convey this information to the reader. It also draws to light the sheer volume of the unconscious and invisible discriminations that happen every day, and I commend the author's ability to gather and present them so entirely. Another side effect of the volume of information is that I don't feel particularly empowered to personally incite a change. I often found myself nodding along with most of the book, but I'm left feeling very unclear as to what to do next. I do, however, believe that I am armed with facts that I didn't have before, and I can use this knowledge to call out the injustices that occur within my sphere of influence.As a whole, most of this book felt like a persuasive essay along the lines of, ""You want proof that male privilege exists, that most systems of governance are biased toward men, and that women are literally dying because of it? Well here's your proof.""And the proof is appalling. Point taken.!121!This is a really good comprehensive investigation of how a failure to account for gender based needs and requirements results in a bias towards cis men.This is exactly why the casual cissexism embedded in it is so unfortunate and harmful.Perez critics the continuous overlooking of women and women's needs, but is herself continuously overlooking trans and nonbinary people. She also keeps switching between sex and gender as interchangeable.The most problematic claim is that a lack of sex-segregated bathrooms in some places increases rape and sexual assault. This is clearly focusing on the wrong aspect of a problem, while creating new problems for people who don't fit the norm. It is extremely disappointing in the context of shedding light on how women are seen as a deviation of the cis male norm, who is seen as default.A critical book published in 2019 which deals with gender cannot ignore trans folks. It is simply not good enough to address cis people exclusively in such a comprehensive book.Hope there will be a better, more inclusive edition soon, as it is highly important this kind of information be accessible for all.!121!Simply said, if someone is in power, he tries to make a policy that meets his wishes and reflects the image of the society, company, etc he wants to build. This can be done in a direct, evil way by treating minorities, women, atheists, etc. with repression until imprisonment, torture and death if they misbehave and in these cases, it is an obvious crime. It gets more subtle when bigotry and indoctrination kick in and lead to both politicians and managers that are not all direct, misogynic sexists. That would either fit the requirements their spin doctors taught them for winning the next election nor the code of conduct, corporate responsibility or whatever ethic mumbo jumbo the PR department has in planning. Those white, rich man's minds have been poisoned by influences of faith, elitist thinking and inhumanity and many of them simply had no chance to get out of this vicious cycle, because it makes no difference if it is a cult, an extremist group or a billionaires club, they are all pretty misguided and pitiful. The worst case, both for women and for the possibility to real change, are those who believe that they are doing the right thing and would call themselves emancipated but keep on pushing laws and employment contracts that discriminate against women indirectly and perfidiously. They don´t give any kind of appreciation, allowance or financial help to mothers without whose immense pain and effort each nation would die out because no kids would be born anymore. They don´t give a dollar for all the unpaid work, the caring for toddlers and especially care-dependent elders and without this, the health system would simply collapse. There are medicinal research areas that are taught, shaped and mainly tested on man. It is a simple economic reason why men are preferred in all kinds of long going and very expensive admission procedures for drugs because they don´t get pregnant and have no staggering hormone levels. The result is that many side effects may cause much more harm in women because they haven´t been tested in such large numbers or anyway. The same questions plops up with the harmfulness of, well, anything, like any kind of food additive, environmental toxins and the regulatory limits. Tested and found harmless for men with an official quality seal. Tested with younger and older women with different hormone levels, muscle mass and probably pregnancy? ""Nope, would have been too difficult and expensive, sorry, nobody does that, probably in Amazon wonderland, but not here."" There are no numbers available regarding the side effects of all drugs, environmental destruction and food risks, but let's say that there may be an unknown number of women that would have profited from clean 50 male/ 50 female test series instead of dying. I find it really difficult to decide if the simple, logical, economic greed is more disgusting than the reminiscences and aftermaths of all those very old, sexist writings by weird old men. Those two axes of evil certainly exponentiate each other, learn from each other and produce the right social and consumer products for him who unofficially still deems women inferior. In design, the number of toilets is a prime example of male domination. This is not deadly, in contrast to using crash test dummies that are normed as male or giving free condoms and restricting female contraception, but an instance of simply forgetting that there is another gender out there. Or designing public transport in a way that makes it impossible to do more than just manly things like driving from home to work and back and not caring about things like groceries, kids and stuff. It would also be more expensive to tailor clothes that fit better at hips and breasts, so it simply isn´t done. As much talk as there is about gendering, sexual harassment, eating disorders, etc. so less is heard about those topics in mainstream media. Those would probably bash the religious groups as long as the broadcast corporation doesn´t belong to the Kraken. But they wouldn´t even touch the economic problems with pincers and gloves, cause they all are very dependent on the companies advertising their products. There are no men in general to blame, but a society and upbringing that makes them so blind to the different necessities of half of the population that their work, publications and statistics get highly subconscious biased, onesided, dangerous and often even deadly, as seen in medicine, especially pharmacy, one of the sickest examples of misleading science I have ever seen, especially because it is so obvious and could be easily prevented. ""This is a men biased world"", one could sing and yes, the so-called strong gender built the whole world with a focus on efficiency, profit or prestige and didn´t listen, care or even think of the needs of all their wives, mothers, sisters and daughters. And they inherited this behavior to their sons instead who live in a world of big data with algorithms, AI and immense potential to use all those tools to improve life for all people, but instead, as daddy taught them, they simply ignore, forget or, the easiest way, don´t even evaluate the data about women to jump in their money storage instead and let gold coins softly recoil from their bald head (from daddy too) producing a hollow sound from a skull just filled with .... By empowering women, making a strict law to make half of each government and management leadership ranks half female, make all research transparent with tools like blockchain and dumping direct and indirect sexism in the trash can of history right next to all the other sick ideas out of white men's heads.This is another great book about the topic:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...I like to talk about WEIRD and the topic is a prime example of it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biashttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%2...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancip...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminismhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexismhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violenc...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminiz...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employm...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereot...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-h...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaid_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuati...Categorieshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...!121!This is a book about unconscious bias. It's not about men deliberately excluding women when considering things like uniforms, city travel, or treatments for medical conditions ... although it's true that once the bias is pointed out, it's not always top of the list to make safety adjustments. And that's really one of the most important points of the book: it endangers women if you design and build the world without considering women's needs and habits. Women are built in a particular way, and they are socially conditioned in a particular way, and they're treated in a particular way - comparing all this to men's situation is useful only to a certain extent because it is so easy for everyone to slip into the mindset that men are the default human, and women are, as the author notes, ""niche"". We design things for people, but really only think of men and their needs because - and companies and designers are open about this - women are harder, with our non-linear bodies and hormones meaning that more sophisticated (and more expensive) research needs to be done.We also design things for men because men are the designers for the most part. They have no experience being women of course, and don't really look into it because, for the most part, it doesn't occur to them. If you're a woman, just think about all the books you've read through the years about male experience, with a male protagonist, and presented - or even taught - to you as ""human experience"". We do it all the time, and I read books regularly with male protagonists sorting out their stuff (if you follow me here, you'll see plenty of ex-Navy-SEALS running around). But women's experience in novels and poems? That's women's experience only. My point here is that while women are trained to identify with both men and women, and indeed possibly favor the male experience, men aren't trained to look at - or think about - women's experience. Criado Perez has really done her research, but what could have been a very statistic-heavy book is in fact very readable, engaging, and so enlightening. The Introduction should really be published on its own - it's magnificent. This is a book to buy and keep, and get some of those sticky notes because you'll want to mark pages for future reference!!121!There is so much relevant, important, fascinating, and deeply troubling information here about the ways in which the world, in big and small ways, is built for white men. BUT. I have to give this book two stars for its appalling erasure of trans and nonbinary people. The words themsleves (transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming) do not even appear in this book. Not once. Nor does the word cisgender. In a book about the ways that a lack of data renders women invisible, and the ways that invisibility literally costs women their lives, it is, frankly, inexcusable that Criado-Perez does the exact same thing to trans people. In her world, apparently, trans and nonbinary people do not exist.This does not have to be a book about trans issues. It is not a book about race, and yet, Criado-Perez includes some analysis of race in the various scenarios she examines. It is not a book about class, and yet she also includes analysis of the way class affects the various data biases she examines. There is very little analysis of queer sexualities, AND YET she manages to precede almost all the data she gives about married couples with the word ""heterosexual"", which at least renders queer people visible. But she does not give this same basic consideration to trans and nonbinary people.There's a whole chapter about the accessibility of public restrooms, in which she does not consider the ways that access to restrooms specifically affects trans and nonbinary folks. There's a whole bit about gendered language, and the ways it shapes how he think and act (which was totally relevant and important) that does not even CONSIDER how gendered language might and does affect (and harm) people who fall outside the gender binary. There's a chapter on how public transit and its infrastructure (bus stations, subway stops, etc.) are not designed with women in mind. She goes into the ways in which various infrastructures are unsafe for women, and the ways in which women experience violence in public places. But she does not once mention specific violence toward trans women, or how likely trans women are to be the targets of violence.I'd read a few reviews before I started this, so I was prepared to be upset by it, but I decided to read it anyway because I found the subject matter as a whole so compelling. But Criado-Perez's failure to even mention the existence of trans people, and people outside the gender binary, just made it nearly impossible for me to take anything she said seriously. This happens a lot in nonfiction and I'm always exhausted and angered by it. Sometimes the oversights are small enough that I still feel the book has some merit. But in a book ALL ABOUT GENDER, and specifically the ways in which ignoring gender leads to serious harm--it's just too big an erasure to get past. The irony is heartbreaking.Do better.!121!This is a long-delayed, hugely important book, which people of ALL genders should be reading. Sadly, more people seem to be discussing it than have actually read it. It's not just about crash test dummies, or voice recognition software, or airline seats, or toilet queues, or medical research. It's about the systematic way in which data on women has been ignored, neglected and downright erased, whereas data on men is not only abundant, but recognized as the universal norm. The needs of the ""average person"" boil down to the needs of the *average man*, and though not all men *are* average, there's still an enduring attitude that male is a default position and female, an aberration. I found myself recognizing so many situations depicted in this book - things I thought that only I had experienced, but which turn out to be common to pretty much all women, whether they're aware of it or not. Read this, and you'll start noticing inequalities you never even considered before. And you'll notice them everywhere.!121!Invisible Women is the story of what happens when we forget to account for half of humanity. It is an exposé of how the gender data gap harms women when life proceeds, more or less as normal. In urban planning, politics, the workplace. It is also about what happens to women living in a world built on male data when things go wrong. When they get sick. When they lose their home in a flood. When they have to flee that home because of war.My husband is not a knuckle-dragging caveman, but he is a middle-aged, white, Canadian male, totally oblivious to the privileges afforded to him by our society (admittedly, many of those privileges are granted to me as well). We were in the car, listening to the radio over the summer, and “It's a Man's World” began to play. Dave chuckled and said, “Boy, things have changed, eh?” And I replied: “And boy, have they stayed the same.” And this stunned him. “You can't believe that,” he said. “Here's a story for you then. A young girl at work...” I cut him off. “Young girl? What, is she eight or nine?” And then he was flustered. “You know what I mean. I'm just trying to tell you a nice story.” He paused like he was going to punish me by not telling me the story after all but soon continued: “Rebecca, who is probably twenty-five and on my team, was asked by HR to assemble some slides for a presentation on the industry and she asked me if she could present it to me first. She reads off the first slide, which is about the gender pay gap, and before she went to the next slide she frowned, looked at her notes, and said, 'This is probably American data.' Because she knows that there's no gender pay gap in our office, and if anything, there are more women than men in senior positions, and more women on a management track.” He looked proud of himself – and he should, I know that this non-caveman, the father of my daughters, is not a sexist or a chauvinist – but still I pushed my point: “If this had been a twenty-five year old male in your story, would you have started off with, 'This young boy at work...?' Because that's what hasn't changed, and no matter what you consciously do to promote the careers and the welfare of the women you know, it's the subconscious biases that are harder for us to navigate because you don't even know what you're doing that's holding us back.” Dave, “shocked” to discover I felt this way, wanted more details about these “subconscious biases” of which I accused him. And while women know that the systems are rigged against us, it's hard to be specific – until now. Caroline Criado Perez has assembled a collection of shocking and eye-opening stories in Invisible Women, very clearly making the point that men, for the most part, aren't consciously trying to hold women back; for the most part, men don't think about women, and the fact that our needs might differ from their own, at all. From medicine to safety devices to public transit, everything is designed and tested to suit the typical male's body and needs, with women's very different bodies and needs considered niche or secondary or “the same but smaller”. It is mostly about the gender data gap: the fact that nearly all studies and research, even medical testing, isn't disaggregated by sex, so there is next to no data about how anything in our societies, which tend to be designed by men for men, affects women differently than men. And where this is no data, a thing – in this case, women – is in effect invisible to those who do the planning – in most cases, men. Informative, shocking, and usefully prescriptive, Invisible Women is a must read for men and women everywhere.The specifics are fascinating – dysmenorrhea (extremely painful periods) was found to be completely alleviated without side effects in the early stages of Viagra testing, but its manufacturer stopped that direction of testing when it found the drug's more profitable application; women in police forces and armies around the world are forced to wear male body armour that doesn't account for breasts and hips and therefore leaves them vulnerable to attack and more prone to workplace injury (a female police officer in Spain was disciplined for acquiring her own made-for-women bulletproof vest); NGOs tend to ask the male heads of household what is required in the aftermath of a disaster, which has, more than once, led to the construction of homes without kitchens in them – but it would take a book-length review to list everything fascinating in this book. I'll just add some of Criado Perez's conclusions regarding the invisibility of women in public planning:
When planners fail to account for gender, public spaces become male spaces by default. The reality is that half the global population has a female body. Half the global population has to deal with the sexualised menace that is visited on that body. The entire global population needs the care that, currently, is mainly carried out, unpaid, by women. These are not niche concerns, and if public spaces are truly to be for everyone, we have to start accounting for the lives of the other half of the world. And, as we've seen, this isn't just a matter of justice; it's also a matter of simple economics.
The invisibility of women in the workplace:
Women have always worked. They have worked unpaid, underpaid, underappreciated, and invisibly, but they have always worked. But the modern workplace does not work for women. From its location, to its hours, to its regulatory standards, it has been designed around the lives of men and is no longer fit for purpose. The world of work needs a wholesale redesign – of its regulations, of its equipment, of its culture – and this redesign must be led by data on female bodies and female lives.
And the invisibility of women in the political sphere:
The data we already have makes it abundantly clear that female politicians are not operating on a level playing field. The system is skewed towards electing men, which means that the system is skewed towards perpetuating the gender gap in global leadership, with all the attendant negative repercussions for half the world's population. We have to stop willfully closing our eyes to the positive discrimination that currently works in favour of men. We have to stop acting as if theoretical, legal equality of opportunity is the same as true equality of opportunity. And we have to implement an evidence-based electoral system that is designed to ensure that a diverse group of people is in the room when it comes to deciding on the laws that govern us all.
The first step to true equality of opportunity and outcome would be to close this gender data gap – wherever there is evidence of inequality, decent people do tend to advocate for change – but this will take more women in decision-making roles (it's disheartening to read of the many researchers who can't get grants to study issues that affect only women as they are too “niche”) and that takes time. I remember back in the 80s my mother complaining that the medical world tended to treat women like small men instead of maybe, just maybe, something not the same as men. So, yeah, that was a long time ago and it's still a man's world.!121!When I got a free copy of Invisible Women (shout out to the LPB Berlin) I was really excited. Many of my friends raved about this book which exposes the gender gap in scientific data and how the resulting gap in knowledge causes the continuous and systematic discrimination against women, creating an invisible bias that has a profound impact on women's lives. Unfortunately, I can't join their choir of praise. Whilst this book had an interesting subject matter, I had some major problems with it: 1 - Not even a mention of trans womenFor a book claiming to zoom in on ""half of the Earth's invisible population"" and having gender as its main focus, it's almost comical that Criado Pérez completely ignores trans women. They're simply not part of her book. No stats on the violence trans women in particular face, or on their income and living situations. I don't know if Criado Pérez ever responded to the criticism she received for not including trans women in her book on fucking women of all people but it reeks of transphobia. 2 - No focus on marginalised womenEven more appalling was the lack of inclusion of BIWOC, disabled women and women living in the Global South. Similarly to trans women, they were not part of this narrative. The reason I found this more appalling was the fact that Criado Pérez actually acknowledged their lack of presence in her book but gave the lacklustre excuse that ""I would often try and find stats for black women or for disabled women and I just couldn't."" UUUMMM, EXCUSE ME, MISS? Your book was published in fucking 2019, how come Black women, for example, have published books like Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present or Women, Race & Class for decades now. I totally get that stats on cis white able-bodied women are easier to find and more readily available in quantity, but it's not like there isn't a single stat on BIWOC or disabled women that you could've included. DO BETTER! In general, Invisible Women reeks of ""whiteness = standard"". Criado Pérez included some quotes in this book that made me really uncomfortable and furious at the same time, e.g. ""We call the 18th century the century of 'Enlightenment', although it expanded the rights of men, it 'narrowed' those of women, because they were forbidden to control their property and income and were excluded from higher education and professional training."" Oh, really? The 18th century expanded the rights of ALL men? ALL men were now able to control their property and income? Interesting. I must've slept through my history lesson then. Whenever Criado Pérez says ""men"" in this book, she means ""white men"". And that sucks. Because she often juxtaposes the condition of ""men"" with those of ""women"", and thus presents a distorted picture, e.g. when she says that women in the US earn less than men, she doesn't state that white women earn more than Black men. Her generalising statements do her cause no good. She comes across as ignorant and her book as lazily researched. 3 - The worst fucking structureWhat can I say? I just hated the structure of this book. Seriously, who edited this? Why have these very specific chapter titles like ""At the workplace"" or ""Visit to the doctor"" when you're not going to primarily talk about these topics in these chapters? It made no damn sense.Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan of giving stat after stat after stat but it became downright impossible to retain the important information of each chapter because everything was so disorganised and disjointed. 4 - Facts? What are facts? When reading nonfiction, especially on a topic you don't know that much about, you always have to trust that the author will provide you with facts and sources you can trust. Unfortunately, regarding the topics I had prior knowledge of, mainly the ones focusing on gender and language, I was shocked to see that Criado Pérez included some research that is highly contested, if not fully refuted. For example, she cites that there is a correlation between gender neutral language and gender equality, stating that countries with English as their official language have a higher gender equality than countries with gender-specific languages like Germany. You don’t need a degree to see that this is absolute bullocks. Countries like Sweden, Switzerland and Norway are among the most gender equal, whereas countries like South Africa or “even” the US aren't shining examples of gender equality. Not sure what Criado Pérez was thinking but it left me wondering if she included other stats as “facts” that can simply be refuted if one was knowledgeable on the subject. So all in all, Invisible Women is not a book I'd recommend!!121!Q:Most of recorded human history is one big data gap. Starting with the theory of Man the Hunter, the chroniclers of the past have left little space for women’s role in the evolution of humanity, whether cultural or biological. Instead, the lives of men have been taken to represent those of humans overall. When it comes to the lives of the other half of humanity, there is often nothing but silence.And these silences are everywhere. Our entire culture is riddled with them. Films, news, literature, science, city planning, economics. The stories we tell ourselves about our past, present and future. They are all marked – disfigured – by a female-shaped ‘absent presence’. This is the gender data gap.The gender data gap isn’t just about silence. These silences, these gaps, have consequences. They impact on women’s lives every day. The impact can be relatively minor. Shivering in offices set to a male temperature norm, for example, or struggling to reach a top shelf set at a male height norm. Irritating, certainly. Unjust, undoubtedly.But not life-threatening. Not like crashing in a car whose safety measures don’t account for women’s measurements. Not like having your heart attack go undiagnosed because your symptoms are deemed ‘atypical’. For these women, the consequences of living in a world built around male data can be deadly.One of the most important things to say about the gender data gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don’t get said at all. (c) Oh, wow. This is a quite good power start to this book. And it gets only better as it proceeds! Basically, it's very difficult to make men to see life through a prism of female life. The reverse is a bit easier since women anyway do a lot of historically 'male' tasks these days. So, it's either get everyone to practice extreme empathy or invite mixed companies to do tasks that require mixed perspectives. Now, people still are finding it challenging and it keeps leading to impressive flip-floppy results in a number of spheres.Great in-depth research do on how economics benefits from taking into account the needs of women. Q:… sex is not the reason women are excluded from data. Gender is. (c) Q:Private motivations are, to a certain extent, irrelevant. What matters is the pattern. What matters is whether, given the weight of the data I will present, it is reasonable to conclude that the gender data gap is all just one big coincidence. (c) Q:It is why a 2015 study of multiple language Wikipedias found that articles about women include words like ‘woman’, ‘female’ or ‘lady’, but articles about men don’t contain words like ‘man’, ‘masculine’ or ‘gentleman’ (because the male sex goes without saying). (c) Q:‘You’ve played games as a blue hedgehog. As a cybernetically augmented space marine. As a sodding dragon-tamer. [. . .B]ut the idea that women can be protagonists with an inner life and an active nature is somehow beyond your imaginative capacities?’ …It should be easier to imagine yourself as a woman than as a blue hedgehog. But on the other hand she’s also wrong, because that blue hedgehog has one particularly important similarity with male players, even more so than species alignment, and that is that Sonic the hedgehog is male. We know this because he isn’t pink, he doesn’t have a bow in his hair, and he doesn’t simper. (c) Some stuff is, naturally, idiotic, like it always manages to be in these books:Q:More recently, a 2017 analysis of ten introductory political-science textbooks found that an average of only 10.8% of pages per text referenced women (some texts were as low as 5.3%). The same level of male bias has been found in recent analyses of Armenian, Malawian, Pakistani, Taiwanese, South African and Russian textbooks. (c) Political science? Well, if women have been barred from politics for a larger part of history, what should the authors refer to? While the question at hand is serious, the discussion should not become irrational. We should stick to the facts not demand that women are invented into textbooks.The author lists a bunch of instances when a woman's work was attributed to a man. Which, she argues, made women's breakthroughs so much harder to see and to attribute correctly. Love this part. Q:For most of history, if women were allowed to compose at all, it was for a private audience and domestic setting. Large orchestral works, so crucial for the development of a composer’s reputation, were usually off limits, considered ‘improper’. Music was an ‘ornament’ for women, not a career. (c) Street design and transportation gender planning - now, that's another extremely important consideration! Q:There is a tendency (as ever) to blame the women rather than male-biased design. But male-biased design is in fact exactly what the problem is here. (c) Q:when we don’t collect and, crucially, use sex-disaggregated data in urban design, we find unintended male bias cropping up in the most surprising of places. (c) Q:A 2016 study found that Indian women who use fields to relieve themselves are twice as likely to face non-partner sexual violence as women with a household toilet. (c)!121!Had a hard time reading this, skipped, scanned, got bored with the ranting and the constant portaying women as victims and mothers. They are many times, but especially in western countries they have and can do more than is suggested in this book. Underwhelming. And yes: I am a feminist. ♀️!121!Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestI read this hot on the heels of TECHNICALLY WRONG, which was a mistake, because I felt like that was a better book: even though it deals with a lot of the same subjects, I felt like TECHNICALLY was more inclusive and intersectionally feminist, and also more accessible. INVISIBLE WOMEN is very dry and data-heavy (which perhaps makes it a more credible read than TECHNICALLY in some regards) and reads like a women's studies textbook. It is also written by a UK woman and largely cites UK studies (although not exclusively).My favorite chapter was the introductory chapter about ""The Default Male"" and how data gaps can cause people to assume gender where there is none. When I was blogging anonymously, and serializing my work anonymously, people often assumed I was a man. There is an assumption, also, for many people to assume that voices of expertise or authority are male, I think, unless told otherwise beforehand. I also liked how the author talked about how incensed men get when women come into ""their"" spaces, and how equality to some can feel invasive. The hidden biases in city planning that followed in the next chapter were also interesting, but after that, I lost interest in the book.I guess my first red flag was the bathroom chapter, where the author makes the odd choice to say that gender neutral bathrooms don't work because they have urinals in them and men can pee faster? But then, why not just put in more stalls? When I still physically went into the office, we had gender neutral bathrooms and they were great. No urinals, just stalls. You didn't have to wait in ""your"" line to go in, and people who were non-binary or perhaps trans but not out didn't have to make a public choice about their identity every time they went in to do the necessary. Weirdly, trans people weren't mentioned in this chapter at all, though, and I thought that was odd because when you are talking about bathroom rights and bathroom accessibility, that's often one of the top 5 issues that comes up. The author instead chose to focus more on how lack of bathroom accessibility can lead to sexual assaults for women.This segues into another thing I noticed other critical reviewers taking issues with: lack of intersectionality. I have the Kindle edition and I did a few quick searches in my copy to check representation: trans people are mentioned not once, LGBT was mentioned once as a voting block, lesbian was mentioned once in reference to what the author calls ""corrective rape"" (lesbians being victims to men who want to turn them straight). Black women were referenced three times, twice in the chapter on health care and once as disproportionate victims of environmental disaster, but the author does not mention that they are also disproportionate victims of violence and also seems to have neglected to discuss how Black women's pain can be especially ignored by medical professionals and they are more likely to be turned away or accused of seeking medication to abuse recreationally.Between the dry text and the surprising gaps, I don't think I can give this a high rating. I really appreciate what it was trying to do but it seems to take a pretty narrow focus on the issues at hand.1.5 stars!121!NOTE (May 29, 2023): Invisible Women is about people assigned female at birth (AFAB) and isn't intersectional. Much of the book is about the physicality of those AFAB. For instance, the argument in favor of female-body crash-test dummies hinges on the fact that people AFAB have (generally) smaller physical proportions. Unfortunately, some of what Criado-Perez says at various points could be used to bolster damaging gender-essentialist views. The author has also been criticized for transphobic views in general. Although she never says anything outrightly transphobic in this book, one part that gave me pause is where she discusses women's bathrooms in refugee camps. Trans-rights as they concern use of public bathrooms continues to be a heated point of contention. What she says here can be distorted by transphobics and trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERF) to serve as proof that trans-women, as people assigned male at birth, are a danger to cisgender women in bathrooms. In fact, research has shown time and again that transgender people are more often the victims of violence, not the perpetrators. As the refugee camps are concerned, women in these spaces may indeed be vulnerable and experience violence, but what happens there is not playing out in bathrooms in the larger world. There is no epidemic of cisgender women being assaulted in bathrooms by trans-women, as transphobics and TERF claim. This is a specious anti-trans argument rooted in fear and purposeful disregard for the facts.REVIEW: Sexism is alive and well. Anyone tuned in today knows this. What far fewer know is how much women are an afterthought in so many ways. Invisible Women explores what Caroline Criado Perez calls “male-default thinking”--that is, the world-wide phenomenon of “male” equaling “standard” to the detriment of women. The male way of life is considered conveniently universal. The male body is regarded as a kind of generic, “neutral body” on which to base design, and the female body is the aberration. Societies around the world unconsciously center men, and we all perpetuate the male default without thinking--for example, automatically using the male pronoun for animals whose sex is unknown to us. The standard is also stunningly extensive, touching almost every aspect of life to disadvantage women at every turn. At best, it’s annoying: Women figure out inconvenient work-arounds for designs based on the male default, temporarily rendering the standard irrelevant. At worst, it’s dangerous and sometimes lethal to women. Measuring the world according to men’s bodies and men’s societal needs puts women at serious risk in countless ways. Perez analyzes lots of these, but to name three: Women are routinely under-represented or excluded in medical research and in drug trials. Cars are more dangerous for them thanks to the exclusive use of male-body crash-test dummies. Snow-plowing favors men’s travel routes, leading to increased injury and death for women. Two factors are at the heart of all the problems: Data are rarely sex-disaggregated, and survey questions too often have a male bias. Both flaws lead to a gender data gap, which in turn leads to imbalanced (or no) allocation of resources for women and little (if any) consideration of needs unique to them. Half of the world’s population is female, yet bizarrely, to those in charge women just don’t exist. They’re invisible. As sexism goes, many people are aware of only the obvious displays, such as paying women less than men for the same job. What Perez examines is next-level sexism. If this book is memorable for anything it’s for shining a spotlight on how very little is not dictated by the male default. I was shocked to learn how unbelievably embedded and pervasive this default is, driven home for me in the most perfect way by Perez’s example of using the male pronoun for animals. She doesn’t touch on this, but I would add that along the same lines is the phenomenon of male-based female names (e.g., “Paula,” “Brianna,” “Kylie,” and so many others). It never goes in the other direction, and almost as bad is that we don’t notice or care that it doesn’t. This book was easily my most educational nonfiction read of 2022, and I simply can’t heap enough praise on it. As an avid reader on the topics of sexism, gender relations, toxic masculinity, and other issues along these lines, I’d begun thinking there wasn’t much new to say. Invisible Women proves otherwise and is a guaranteed eye-opener for virtually all readers. It can’t not be: From the moment we’re born, male-as-standard is reinforced relentlessly and quickly internalized. This standard is obviously sexist, but it’s also lazy, illogical, and unconsciously upheld to a severe degree. Invisible Women is a must for all but especially for those in a position to make big changes--who are willing to confront the male-default standard in the first place. Fortunately, in analyzing the problems, Perez draws attention to what the solutions are, and they’re fairly straightforward and do-able if the motivation is there.!121!4.5 ☆ rounded up because Everyone should read this book!you don’t have to realize you’re being discriminated against to in fact be discriminated againstCaroline Criado-Perez tackles an immense topic and she succeeds in demonstrating that women have been rendered invisible by virtue of cultural norms that men sometimes have unthinkingly and at other times deliberately have adopted. By excluding women from consideration, not only does all of humanity lose out on potentially transformative insights but women are exposed to greater harm ranging from injury and up to death. If you are female, your first response may be to look at your life and believe “not me!” because you’re surrounded by respectful people of both sexes. If you are male, then I’m going to appeal to your innate sense of fairness and decency to consider reading Invisible Women.Let’s start with the indispensable cell phone. Chances are good that you have a smartphone since you’re on Goodreads / social media. Have you noticed that the design of these phones have increased to the point that you need both hands to phone and to operate the camera feature (which are both features you’d likely require during an emergency) and that the phone is too big for most of your pockets (if you’re even wearing clothing with pockets)? The males would be more likely than females to say “no difference, no big deal.” Or have you noticed that you prefer either compact cars or SUVs which seat you up very high because both provide better sightlines and visibility from the driver’s seat than the large family sedan that your parents probably drove? I know that I do.What both questions have in common is that the smartphone and the car were designed with the primary user assumed to be male, who has larger hands and who is taller on average than females. So even if you said, “yeah, sure,” you likely have shrugged them off as minor inconveniences. But these examples are just the tip of the iceberg. The internet and the technological capabilities of modern life have created many benefits and efficiencies. Companies have had decades to collect user data (location, internet traffic patterns, demographics, etc) and industries have compiled massive corpora (databases of voices, text, and images). We’re now in the age of Big Data, with programmers designing algorithms to sift through the oceans of data. But what if those algorithms are based on corpora predominantly featuring male voices, male images, and adjectives that are culturally favorable to males over females? As programmers are wont to say, “garbage in, garbage out.” This means that whatever bias exists in the corpora will be amplified by the time that algorithm completes its search. This could explain why 30 percent of resumes a company receives are the lucky minority to be seen by human eyes. I sincerely doubt that of the 30 percent of resumes which are seen by humans that they equally represent the two sexes.You may then think that you’re not job-hunting and you’ve got a great professional network anyways. But there’s more. Drugs may not work for you if you’re female. There was a 2004 study by Sherry Marts and Sarah Keitt that demonstrated that differences between the two sexes go down to every tissue and organ system in the human body, as well as in the “prevalence, course, and severity” of the majority of common human diseases. Despite the National Institute of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 making it illegal not to include females in federally-funded clinical trials, a 2015 federal government audit of FDA revealed that 40 percent of documents still did not specify the sex of participants. So maybe that’s why you have to try many drugs and different dosages before finding medical relief. Oh, females also are more likely to die or suffer longer because their medical issues present symptoms differently compared with men. Doctors, for the most part, have not been trained to account for these biological differences. Since 1989, cardiovascular disease is the number one health cause of death for women in the US. Perhaps you’ve heard the advice to take a low-dose of aspirin daily to help lower your chances of getting heart disease? The truth is that advice is effective for men, not for women who may actually be harmed by following that guidance, as the American Heart Association pointed out in 2016.Finally, there is the statistic released by a 2015 McKinsey study: “globally, 75 percent of unpaid work is done by women."" But you already knew that, didn’t you?Getting concerned yet? Find out more, by reading Invisible Women. It is easy to read and there are no tables of statistics or graphs. Much as I would have really liked graphical representation of statistics, the lack of comprehensive and historical data supports her basic premise of the book - women are invisible. I personally also would have wanted more depth than breadth for not all of her points were made equally strong.For those of you who already know this, Invisible Women is still worth reading as Criado-Perez provides some coverage of women in other parts of the world as well as suggestions for how to change this systemic problem. Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth. ~ Simone de Beauvoir!121!Eye opening!!! So interesting to see how deep inequality really goes systemically. I mean you know it does, but I've never looked at it through the eyes of all of this data before, or lack there of. It discusses a lot of topics that are not generally talked about when people are talking about gender inequality. Areas that you have never even thought about; for example things like snow removal, public transportation, how public bathrooms are designed. Some of the things discussed are life threatening, like the symptoms for a heart attack or the use of crash test dummies, but some are less so. However, when all of this data to all of these situations are added up, it can become very life threatening as it leads to a very large gap between genders. Very interesting. Also, keep in mind that although this book has many stories added in to make it quite readable, it is still a book based around data. I do think it is a very important read though as it discusses data and solutions that otherwise would likely not be discussed as they are so ingrained into our society we usually don't even notice. There is no one person making these rules that we can just blame and fight against; there are so many subconscious biases in all areas of our lives, and this book really points out so many. Definitely recommend as it is a great starting place to identifying the areas that need improvement.!121!Written by a feminist who is looking for inequalities and finds them everywhere. Well, in the direction of the ""female victim"". It's fair to discuss heart attack symptoms differing in men and women and certainly this info. should get out there, especially as women become more obese. She mentioned that she was angry and upset while writing this book (royal society prize) and I believe that is why she couldn't see alternative explanations for many of her complaints.Regarding her data on women being more likely to be injured in car crash. Her conclusion that this is so, because many women are shorter and thus closer to the steering wheel may have some validity, but this would also apply to shorter men. I didn't see this analysis undertaken by her. It may also be that women are smaller, have less muscle mass and smaller bones, so are more likely to be injured when ramming into something. Again, no discussion of this possibility. And, how are you going to make a seatbelt for pregnancy, unless it's detachable. If there were a market for this, someone would already be rich. Of course, if a seatbelt is detachable, it may detach when you don't want it to detach, and you would see lawsuits galore. Also, my wife, who is a car designer made this point: A big person can't fit into a small individuals seat, while a small person can fit into a seat built for a larger person. That's why it's called mass production, not custom production. Nothing sinister here, just simple economics. An army study a few years ago showed women were twice as likely to be injured while training. Women also suffer more concussions playing soccer than men, due to a less muscular neck, smaller skull, etc. They also report injuries more often. So, a lot to unpack here. Although she throws out lots of data, it's meaningless unless you ask the right questions and her anger while writing it prevented her from seeing alternative explanations.When asked to draw a person, most will draw a male. Is it possible that's because it's easier to draw a male-fewer curves, not because of some sinister bias? I'm no artist and would definitely draw a male because it's easier. Again, no discussion of that possibility. Her discussion of coders is idiotic. She sites one company using an algorithm that looks for coders on a supposedly hostile site for women. How about telling us how many men vs women go into computer science (17% women in 2017) or who want to code. How many men vs women want to teach kids, box, fight in wars, do roofing work, do nursing work, garbage collecting, brick laying, designing, coal mining, etc. There are men and women who are dissuaded from choosing professions dominated by the other sex, but most individuals do as they please. I majored in Microbiology, which is 80% female. It didn't bother me. Pretending that men and women want to go into the same fields is just nutty, in my opinion and the data don't support this notion.She also perpetuates this myth about the ""pay gap"". It someone could pay women 78 cents on the dollar for the same work a man would do, that person would be very rich. Only people who don't understand capitalism would believe this drivel. Same hours worked, same job, same experience means same pay. Women work fewer hours per week and choose different professions. The AAUW, a feminist organization, found the wage gap is about 7 cents. But, they didn't factor in the fact the men are more likely to ask for raises and negotiate upon getting a job offer. Flu shot- J Hopkins published a study in 2019 (july 12 npj vaccines, Sabra Klein, PhD) which showed womans stronger immune response is due to estrogen and as such wanes as women get older. Testosterone lessens this immune response. Men with low testosterone and women with high estrogen elicit more of an immune response. Here is what is important though- The researchers suggested men and menopausal women get higher doses of vaccine because they are not being adequately protected. Young women don't suffer more side effects with the current vaccine. What the author thought was hurting women, actually is hurting men-this line of thought wouldn't occur to her, due to her linear thinking style. There are thousands of studies done every year and the vast majority focus both on men and women. Why? Because they companies want to sell as much product as they can and don't want to get sued due to unknown adverse reactions. You can find a ""bath"" studies with just men, but a very small percentage of studies involve just men. The bath study was looking at blood pressure, which probably is tied to relaxation. Perhaps, because women go through estrous, the researchers thought this may skew the data. Say, if women are feeling bloated or have headaches during their period. Again, nothing sinister, they may have wanted to control as many variable as possible and didn't have the cash to do two studies. Remember to keep everything in percentage terms. The vast majority of studies are done with both men and women.Air conditioning: It's more acceptable to put on a sweater than to strip down to a t-shirt. If you allow me to work in a t-shirt, by all means turn the heat up. As we all know, this is not allowed in most offices. By the way, how about the bias in dress in most offices. Women can wear pretty much anything in my office, but men must wear ties and long sleeve shirts and dress pants and dress shoes.No discussion of data bias in school as it relates to how the behavior norm has become more feminine. Boys are much more likely to be tranquilized in an effort to curb their natural rambunctiousness, more likely to find solace in video games, less likely to read for fun, more likely to be influenced negatively by the absence of a male role model, among other factors. If folks want a better world, this is an issue to address. Men without purpose become violent, drug addicted and engage in criminality to a much greater extent than do idle women. In conclusion, the author see everything through the lens of victimhood and thus alternative explanations, outside of bias, elude her. It's impossible to begin to learn what one thinks one already knows-Epictetus. A suggestion of other books to read alongside this one: The blank slate, why beautiful people have more daughters, the diversity delusion. Also, the documentary, the red pill would be worth the watch, if a different perspective is wanted.!121!I finished this book a few weeks ago and it’s taken me this long to get my thoughts all together on this book. The reason it took me a while to get coherent thoughts written out? Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez was a good read, but one of those that exposes maddening aspects of the world we live in. In this case, it looks at how in areas like healthcare to education and urban planning, the world is biased in favor of men to the detriment of women. Before anyone angrily comments, Invisible Women is a book regarding unconscious bias. Not every man out there is deliberately designing women out of the world or is intentionally misogynistic in their attitudes. It’s just that those in power who are making the public policy or scientific recommendations that affect everyone overwhelmingly still tend to be men that largely are using their own life experiences and applying it to their work. In this way, male becomes default for all of humanity.So, largely it comes down to a huge data gap fed by the idea that the universal concept for humanity is male. Still, I couldn’t help but find myself angry throughout the whole book on behalf of women, because unconscious bias or not, purposely, or not, those in power are making decisions that tend to result in harm for women. (Or even death.) Resources are not allocated where there is considerable need. When half the world’s population is neglected, it hurts everybody. 


 “The gender data gap isn’t just about silence. These silences, these gaps have consequences.” 


For example, take the healthcare dimension. I recently listened to a podcast that talked about endometriosis. (Such issues also came up in Invisible Women.) For the women who are affected, it is often debilitating pain that comes with menstruation and can result in fertility issues. (And even heavy bleeding when it’s not that time of the month.) Endometrial tissues found in the uterus can also grow elsewhere—say the ovaries, pelvic area, and fallopian tubes most commonly. They’ll react like endometrial tissues do and slough off when menstruation comes along, except they have no way to leave the body and become trapped. Inflammation ensues which can eventually lead to scarring. I know someone who has this condition, and it’s very clear that the pain is not in her head—e.g., psychosomatic. (Although this doesn’t mix well with existing mental health conditions.)Only problem is that medical research hasn’t really prioritized these “women’s issues” and is similarly way behind when it comes to conditions like endometriosis. Not much is known about why endometriosis happens, although there are several theories such as immune system disorders (perhaps the immune system is unable to clear away these rogue tissues) or that these tissues can get transported to other places in the body via the lymph system. That is a problem when it comes to developing effective treatments that get at the root causes of endometriosis. 


 “The bodies, symptoms and diseases that affect half the world’s population are being dismissed, disbelieved and ignored. And it’s all a result of the data gap combined with the still prevalent belief, in the face of all the evidence that we do have, that men are the default humans. They are not.” 


I happened to focus on the medical example, but there’s a whole lot more areas she looks at, such as the tax system and how women’s childcare and other domestic responsibilities are not included in economic formulas as monetized work (e.g., women’s care responsibilities go unpaid) to the consequences of women’s underrepresentation politically. Perez acknowledges that the magic fix will not only be closing the gender data gap, but any improvement in this area would also bring huge benefits for women and for society as a whole. Now, we just need to get more women elected to positions that will allow them to enact public policy to close this data gap! -CoraFind this book and other titles within our catalog.!121!Incredibly interesting!!121!This book!! It took me a long time to read, since it´s a lot about (very frustrating) numbers. It´s pretty great, and terrifying at the same time. We have a lot of work to do, if we want things to truly change, but the first thing to maybe read this book and try to understand all the different things that are still separating women from really being equals in a default male world.!121!This was an extremely interesting and informative read. I learnt so much from reading this book, which I hope I can retain. But yes this book is very statistic heavy, as a result there is a lot to take in.!121!An important and insightful book on all the biases backed into our society, making life harder for women. A deluge of data proves the point of the author, making the injustice of not tackling the issue jarringWhiteness and maleness are silent precisely because they do not need to be vocalised. Whiteness and maleness are implicit. They are unquestioned, they are the default.More thoughts to follow! 🦸‍♀️📊🔍⚖️👩‍🔬!121!I decided to read ‘Invisible Women’ after coming across an extract from it in the Guardian and associated discussion on twitter. Both focused on how practically everything is designed for the mythical ‘average man’. I'm very aware of this due to being only 5ft tall. I cannot reach any overhead racks in trains, hanging straps in buses, or top shelves in supermarkets. I’ve given up on backpacks because they’re never comfortable and find smart phones incredibly unwieldy to use, one of many reasons I hate them. The desk and chair I work in are too high for me to sit comfortably, so I have to adjust my posture all the time. Constant minor inconveniences of this kind are something I’ve just learned to live with. Such relatively trivial examples are useful to highlight a much more serious point: the world is still largely designed by and for men. Perez considers the impact of this in a variety of specific areas including politics and healthcare, repeatedly highlighting the lack of data on women’s experiences and need for this to understand and improve them. While I found the book very readable, after a while this started to feel slightly more like a weakness than a virtue. By this I mean that any given section could be lifted out and published as a high quality thinkpiece. Perez cites more supporting evidence than most, however I felt that the book had rather a loose thesis and didn't make very strong suggestions for solutions. Perhaps I am merely quicker to blame capitalism than she is? (I tend to blame capitalism for practically everything - probably because practically everything is capitalism’s fault.) For example, one chapter criticises GDP as an inaccurate measure of economic activity, which it is, then suggests economic growth could be achieved by encouraging more women into paid work through better childcare and tax policy. This felt like a rather simplistic summary of the many flaws in GDP, notably its disregard of environmental costs, and of women in work, as underpaid bullshit jobs aren't necessarily liberating. That said, I share her incredulity that big pharma has no interest in researching period pain and PMS. So many women, including myself, would pay good money on a regular basis for some over-the-counter solution to the nightmare of periods. Nurofen just doesn’t cut it and GPs have little to offer. Come on, markets, supply a good to meet our needs! To put my griping in context: I found the book well-argued and written, however it is definitely a piece of longform journalism rather than a work of feminist economics, politics, or theory. Personally, I would have preferred a bit more depth over breadth. That is just my preference, though, and it would be very unfair to criticise the book for not being something it never claimed to be. The topic is vast and Perez has chosen a good range of examples to illustrate key areas. Thus it’s very depressing to read if you regularly experience what it describes. This hit me particularly hard, as it summarises my first year as a junior lecturer:But their unpaid work inside the workplace doesn’t help either. When students have an emotional problem, it is their female professors, not their male professors, they turn to. Students are also more likely to request extensions, grade boosts, and rule-bending of female academics. In isolation, a request of this kind isn’t likely to take up much time or mental energy - but they add up, and they constitute a cost on female academics’ time that male academics mostly aren’t even aware of, and that universities don’t account for. [...] The inequity of women being loaded with less valued work is compounded by the system for evaluating this work, which is itself systematically biased against women. [...] Less effective male professors routinely receive higher student evaluations than more effective female teachers. Students believe that male professors hand marking back more quickly - even when that is impossible because it’s an online course delivered by a single lecturer, but where half the students are led to believe that the professor is male and half female. Female professors are penalised if they aren’t deemed sufficiently warm and accessible. But if they are warm and accessible they can be penalised for not appearing authoritative or professional. On the other hand, appearing authoritative and knowledgeable as a woman can result in student disapproval, because this violates gendered expectations. Meanwhile men are rewarded if they are accessible at a level that is simply expected in women and therefore only noticed if its absent.You really can’t win in academia. Anecdotally, I’ve observed a pattern of senior male professors taking on postgraduate supervisees, then being so inaccessible that these orphan students turn to more junior female professors for guidance. Rather than tell such students to send their supervisor another email I try to help them, effectively taking on work that’s being shirked by men paid twice as much as me. The book didn’t just cover sexism that I was already aware of on a daily basis. The chapter on international development and disaster response was eye-opening and, inevitably, deeply depressing. Perez recognises the important racial as well as gendered elements there and at other points, which is helpful. I found her introductory definitions of sex and gender rather unsatisfactory, though. They are unnecessarily biologically essentialist, and thus surprisingly old-fashioned in tone. This doesn’t undermine Perez’s arguments as such, but it’s a bit disappointing as with only slight editing they could have been much more inclusive. Regarding exciting new manifestations of sexism, I really liked the discussion of how automation via algorithms amplifies bias in training datasets. It’s interesting to compare Perez’s suggestion of more granular data-gathering and rigorous testing of algorithms with the fundamental critique of Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. There’s a lot more to be said about how crude and reductive data mining can be; sexism is by no means the only form of inequality that can be reproduced through automation. By looking for correlations in big data without any interest in causation, analytics will find gendered behaviour patterns without providing any explanation for why they might differ, let alone whether these differences are fair. I’d highly recommend ‘Invisible Women’ to men as a readable evidence base for 21st century gender inequality. I’d recommend it to women with the caveat that it’s a reminder of the many ways that being female sucks (albeit to different degrees depending on ethnicity, wealth, nationality, etc). The Guardian extract is an accurate representation of the book as a whole - it has the readability and passion of high quality journalism, without the systematic insight of more academic work.!121!If you want more anger inducing proof for the fact that the systems in place across the world are inherently rigged against women because male definitions and standards have always been default, then this book is a perfect read. Even supposedly gender-neutral designs are actually biased against women due to non-availability of sex-disaggregated data.This staggering lack of data shapes the dangerous terrain women try to navigate on a daily basis. Perez, in this book, presents numerous examples with citations to demonstrate how by failing to account for female anatomy, violence against women and unpaid work (which is mostly done by women), the designs of our public spaces, workplaces, tools, medicinal drugs and vehicles are uncomfortable at best and risking half the global population's lives at worst.A lot of these designs further enforce and amplify biases already in place. Gender roles that even little girls learn by watching the society around them are also fortified by existing socio-political systems. But conversely, gender specific products that would make women's lives far easier are simply lacking. It's not our place to behave like a man, but it's really annoying that we aren't more like them apparently. I am writing this review from a place of deep desolation. As I was just finishing this book up within which the author spoke about and condemned the infamous 2012 Delhi gang rape case of a young woman then dubbed 'Nirbhaya', my country's print media was flooding with reports of a nineteen year old lower caste Dalit woman's rape by four upper caste men: she had multiple fractures, her tongue was bitten off, she was strangled and left to die. After struggling in the hospital for two weeks she passed away on 29th September. The police refused to hand over her body to her family and burnt it secretly at 2:30 am. When the news initially broke out, the state machinery even claimed it was fake. As citizens are now protesting and fighting for justice, Indian rape statistics are also doing rounds on social media as they did in 2012. But have these statistics been considered and incorporated into law making? No. I woke up and read a barrage of tweets along the lines of ""respect everyone, be a human and not a feminist"" in response to the tweets condemning rape. Listen, the only way feminism can harm you is if your own well-being depends on the systemic oppression and exploitation of women. The least we can do is inform ourselves and try to be more socially conscious in our choices. This is a very important book, please read it.!121!Read this if you're ready to get mad about how basically every research study done and used to create solutions to problems for ""all people"" are based on the average white male. Not surprising, but infuriating to see it laid out so plainly. I've always been so angered about technology being not useful for my tiny hands, and it's relieving -- and again, angering and frustrating -- this is just a norm of being female when research completely excludes the fact your body isn't the average white dude. And don't get me started on the viagra research. Crucial reading for feminists and for anyone who does product research. There is so much work to be done.!121!It's a man's world. Sure, I'm familiar with income disparity, about how office temperatures are dialled to male physiology, and the head scratching oversight from Fitbit tracking various health statuses but not menstrual cycles. Obvious annoyances but this book outlines how much more is at stake. How about the fact that it wasn't until 2011 that the US started using a female crash-test dummy. Up to that point they simply used a small male version which leads to cars being completely designed around the male body. As a result, females are nearly 50% more likely to be seriously hurt in a collision and 17% more likely to die. How police protective armour is specifically formed to the male body leading to female officers having a higher likelihood of dying from a stab wound due to ill-fitting gear. How women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed after a heart attack because trials tend to use and research predominantly male participants. Or how about that miraculous drug that helped alleviate menstrual cramps being deemed non-viable and unlikely to turn a profit that would go on to find life as a little blue pill to address male erectile dysfunction instead. This book is filled with tidbits that spotlight our patriarchal data bias that go beyond the obvious to things like transit routes, snow removal and discovering the story of Mozart's older sister. This is wall-to-wall knowledge that will having you nudging your partner, friend or co-worker with a ""didja know?"" that still leaves you shaking your head if not outright pulling your hair. Well worth the read, can't recommend it enough.!121!ALL THE STARS !!!!!

This is one of the most important books I've read in a long time. I don't have the words to express how important this book is. I was considering whether I should read this, thinking I'm a feminist, I read a lot of stuff on the subject, I kind of know it all. WRONG! It turns out things are much worse than I/we ever imagined.This book covers so many fields:- history - how women have been completely erased from history;- education, work, occupational health and safety;- architecture- car safety- medicine - OMG! Did you know that over 90% of studies and medications are done mostly on male animal/human subjects and don't account for biological differences in women, which result in increased female mortality? Everything from heart attacks diagnosis which is based on male symptoms, which is not how the majority of women present; statins for cholesterol are ineffective for 80% of women but increase their chance of developing diabetes which then is a much higher risk for women developing heart problems. The examples are multiple. From misdiagnosis, and ""my favourite"" dismissal of women's symptoms, everything is stacked against us. It's not all intentional and mean spirited, it's just that men, even the good ones, always think of the male as the default. This is yet another reason why REPRESENTATION is important. The meritocracy is a myth, perpetrated by white cis males because it has served and still serves them well. Women do anywhere from two to ten times more unpaid care work, which results in worse labor outcomes, and all the consequences that come with that - no career advancements, less money, jobs that are low paid, women taking on jobs they're overqualified for etc, . Gendered poverty is a real thing. I don't know about the situation in other countries, but in Australia, older women (50+) have been the fastest-growing group of homeless people in recent years. It makes my blood boil! Really, just read this book. I plan on banging on about this book and because I'm annoying like that, I'm going to question and challenge most things. We need a revolution, we need to appreciate and reward women for all the unpaid house/care work without which the society wouldn't function. We need to question and challenge the status quo in research, medicine, arts, academia, e v e r y t h i n g everywhere.I often fantasise about organising or participating in a National Women's strike, as they had in Iceland in 1975. Anyone else?Update: Check out the author's newsletter/blog https://newsletter.carolinecriadopere...!121!I read this hoping to do a presentation at work for our Women's Development forum, but holy crap, how in the world do you boil down such a densely filled book into 10-15 slides and a clean summary? IT CAN'T BE DONE. Well, I guess it can, but I wouldn't come close to doing justice to this vastly important book. ""Gender data gap"" would sound too much like a buzz word, and the message could never penetrate as it should.Instead I am submitting this as a book club choice at work, but hoping we can read it in the background, over the course of a quarter, not a month. Each woman will wish to sip, not chug, this book as we may for many of our less weighty novels and business books.!121!I knew that having a penis gave me certain advantages but I was completely oblivious of the extent of those advantages. From the myth of meritocracy to the hyperbole of gender-neutrality, Pérez breaks it all down. While women represent 50% of world population, their representation in political leadership, in scientific and technological research, and in health and safety protocols is a fractional pittance. Confirmation bias being what it is, it seems rather pointless to point out that the people who most need to read this probably never will. The few that do will likely never finish it or will counter Pérez’s powerful collection of studies and statistics with anecdotal tripe—patriarchal apologists are a very vocal minority.","['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Womens', 'Sociology']"
I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban (Hardcover),Malala Yousafzai,4.15,572821,2012,"I come from a country that was created at midnight. When I almost died it was just after midday.When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate.I Am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.","Reading this book reminded me of how much I take for granted every day: Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion. The freedom to go to the store without needing a male escort. And the ability to get an education, regardless of gender.""I was a girl in a land where rifles are fired in celebration of a son, while daughters are hidden away behind a curtain, their role in life simply to prepare food and give birth to children.""Malala, who is now 16, is an outspoken advocate for girls to have the same right to go to school as boys. In her native Pakistan, she lost that ability when the Taliban took over: ""I was 10 when the Taliban came to our valley ... It seemed to us that the Taliban arrived in the night just like vampires. They appeared in groups, armed with knives and Kalashnikovs ... They looked so dark and dirty and that my father's friend described them as 'people deprived of baths and barbers.'""The Taliban started bombing schools and decreed that girls couldn't get an education. Malala's father was a school principal and encouraged her to speak out. She was only 15 at the time, but threats were made against her and her family. And in October 2012, when she was riding the school bus with her friends, a man with a gun climbed aboard the vehicle and shot Malala in the head.Amazingly, Malala survived the bullet and was able to recover. She and her family currently live in England, but Malala writes about how much she misses her home country and wishes she could return to be with her friends. Her graciousness was such that she did not wish revenge on her attacker, and instead prays for peace.""I thank Allah for the hardworking doctors, for my recovery and for sending us to this world where we may struggle for our survival. Some people choose good ways and some choose bad ways. One person's bullet hit me. It swelled my brain, stole my hearing and cut the nerve of my left face in the space of a second. And after that one second there were millions of people praying for my life and talented doctors who gave me my body back. I was a good girl. In my heart I had only the desire to help people.""Malala's story is both heartbreaking and inspiring. I admire her courage and her tenacity, and also hope that her country will one day find peace. ""Why are we Muslims fighting with each other? ... We should focus on practical issues. We have so many people in our country who are illiterate, and many women have no education at all. We live in a place where schools are blown up. We have no reliable electricity supply. Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani.""The book is lovingly written, and I also appreciated her stories about the history of Pakistan and her people, the Pashtuns. While reading the book I realized that I knew more about the history of other countries in the region, such as Afghanistan, Iran and India, than I did about Pakistan, and it was very informative. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in women's rights, current events, history or inspirational memoirs.""Today we all know education is our basic right. Not just in the West; Islam too has given us this right. Islam says every girl and every boy should go to school. In the Quran it is written, God wants us to have knowledge. He wants us to know why the sky is blue and about oceans and stars ... The Taliban could take our pens and books, but they couldn't stop our minds from thinking.""Update October 2014:I was thrilled to hear that Malala had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. I have recommended this book to numerous people in the past year, and am still amazed by her courage. Three cheers for Malala!!121!Just to be clear, the rating is for the book not the person Malala herself. I read this quickly whilst on holidays and was keen to find out more about her story after seeing a short tv piece just before leaving home. I think her story is amazing and her courage remarkable, her plight and vision inspiring but the book itself I found to be an odd mix of political and historical fact and personal reflections that didn't quite gel for me. Still a worthy read and I really appreciated the insight into the young girls life with her family. I can see that the historical documentation that was added, presumably by the other author, is there to inform people like me who have a flimsy grasp on the political events and motivations of power brokers in that region of the world, however I found Malala's personal account to be much more interesting and think the book would have done better with a different angle that focused on just her story or even told the political through her eyes or words...I found myself wondering sometimes ""who am I listening to here?"" and feeling a little as if I was being coerced into forming a political opinion based on the interpretations being offered in the factual accounts.!121!I really wanted to love this book. I don't think anyone can deny the difficulties this girl has faced or the impact she has had on the world. However, the book reads like an odd jumble of Pakistani history, politics, and personal experience that never quite comes together into a cohesive narrative. The first few chapters are very inconsistent and meander all over the place with no clear destination; it sounds more like a collection of memories or family stories interspersed with factual information about Pakistan and the history of the Swat valley, and I had a very difficult time staying engaged and keeping track of the many people mentioned. The story becomes a little more streamlined as Yousafzai starts to recount her older childhood years leading up to the banning of education for girls, but I still had issues with the writing. This is one of the more egregious examples, but I think it captures the serious need for editing: ""The new girls had horrible stories. Ayesha told us how one day on the way home from Sangota she had seen a Taliban holding up the severed head of a policeman by its hair, blood dripping from the neck. The Sangota girls were also very bright, which meant more competition. One of them, Rida, was excellent at making speeches."" (p.144). It is certainly inspirational to hear Yousafzai's and her father's stories about speaking up in defiance of politicians, local mullahs, and the Taliban, but I think many readers might lose interest trying to follow the disjointed narrative. The book feels like it was really rushed, which is a serious shame. Someone this brave and interesting deserves a better book.!121!We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.
Criticism be damned, I loved this book.Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani girl, was just fifteen years old when the Taliban decided she needed to be taken out. That she was too dangerous to be alive. That she was radical, sacrilegious and so much more. 
And what did she do?
 What was the heinous, terrible actions that necessitated her being shot? 
Education is education. We should learn everything and then choose which path to follow."" Education is neither Eastern nor Western, it is human.
She spoke up for education - particularly for girls - and was doing such an inspirational job, that she became a 'problem'.Her father, a schoolmaster, founded many schools throughout her childhood and he always gave Malala the option to speak up for her right to education. And speak up she did. She corresponded with newspapers, campaigned on the radio and even appeared on television. 
One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world.
She gave a voice to the ever-silenced children, especially the girls, who were forced to cover up and stay at home. To give up their education because it was ""improper"".Malala expressed her love for God, for her people and for the right to education - time and time again. 
When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.
And when the Taliban heard of her, they decided that she, a fifteen year old girl, needed to be killed.And so they tried. They shot her in the head on her way to school on October 9th, 2012.But something happened that they had not calculated - 
she survived. 
And the attempted murder (assassination? I think she's important enough to bump this to attempted assassination) didn't cow her or put her in her place. She survived and she is ready to continue the fight.
We were scared, but our fear was not as strong as our courage.
In short - amazing. Truly amazing.This book felt like a honest chat between the author and the world - she unashamedly details the poverty, the cruelty and the losses that her family, and the families around her, suffered.But at the same time, she speaks so honestly and fervently about her love for God, her country and even for those who attacked out of fear or misguidance.Normally, when there is a second author, the book begins to feel false - as in there's too much influence from the more professional writer, and that erases all of the personal voice. But that was not the case in this one.Malala's felt so incredibly real, the way she spoke about her life in Pakistan - from her humble beginnings to the success of her father's school - and heartbreaking, especially when she talked about her freedom being taken away slowly. This is a book that should be read by everyone - especially the those who oppose her - because if you can feel one ounce of love that Malala feels for her country and education, then I honestly don't see why anyone would keep fighting it. 
If one man can destroy everything, why can't one girl change it?
The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge - an audiobook read by the authorYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!Being a fellow Muslim, I was indeed intrigued and awed by the courage of this young girl who is brave enough to speak up about what is wrong with her country and strive for education to be available for all.Coming from a country where education is a main priority and females overpopulated the men in schools, colleges and universities, I was indeed aghast to discovered that in certain parts of the world, women are being treated as second class citizens. It brought a tear to my eyes, how Malala and her friends struggled to continue their education despite the horrors of war, earthquake and the ongoing power struggle between the military and the Islamic militants in Pakistan. Certainly, Malala owed much of her courage from her own father who is an education activist and is the owner of a private school. Their family background and details about the Swat Valley is described vividly in the book and readers get to know more about the places that she has lived and been to.This book should be given out to every teen so that they would realise how important an education is and not to think of schooling so lightly. I felt so grateful to be able to live in a country where although the majority are Muslims, the women are not banned from attending schools and told to stay at homes to serve the men. Thank you, Malala for bringing attention to your plight. Isn't it ironic that instead of silencing Malala with the gunshot, the Taliban instead have given her an even bigger voice that has been heard the world over?!121!These days it seems like our world is a giant game of telephone. Any news story or online gossip you hear is hard to believe because it has been skewed so much since it left the source. It is refreshing and enlightening to hear a story straight from the source - especially on the topic of life in the Middle East which is always quickly demonized in America. By experiencing Malala's story, it gives a true face to the people of Pakistan who are mostly wanting peace and prosperity, not oppression and terror.I highly recommend this book to anyone who only has views of the world from the news and social media. Seeing how the war on terror in the Middle East was experienced by a child on the front lines is pretty amazing. I thought my teenage drama was hard here in the United States, but what Malala and her countrymen and women went through is humbling. In fact, I think the story of this book can be of value to anyone living today who feels like they are far away from the terror or that they are better than people from other countries. For every terrorist, there are hundreds of people just like us.5 stars all the way - let's just hope other books like this stop having to be written because people are being terrorized and having their rights threatened. The more people that read this and don't take it with a grain of salt, the closer we will all be to a better world.!121!June 2021I bought Vogue for the first time, just to read the interview. At 23, she comes across as very much the same person, but nuanced. Her best friend from Oxford is quoted as saying:“She came into university as an adult, and left it as a young adult.”Review continues below photo...Image: Malala on Vogue’s cover (Source.)University gave her choices and time for herself, including time to - nearly - miss essay deadlines. She deserves a pedestal, but in many ways, she wants to be, and is, delightfully normal. Having graduated in the first summer of the Covid pandemic, she’s still not quite sure what to do next, but campaigning for girls’ education is still core to her mission, and she hasn’t ruled out politics. The power of storytelling is part of that, hence her deal with Apple TV+ to produce animations, dramas, and children’s shows. She prefers consensus to confrontation and thinks activism by tweet is not enough. Her modesty, charm, and giggles still shine through: she didn’t mention her Nobel prize on her application to Oxford (but of course, they’d know). When Kate Phelan tentatively asked her if she’d had a boyfriend at Oxford, Malala’s reaction made her (the journalist) “feel like I’m torturing a kitten”. But later, Malala picks up the subject, though unsure if she will ever get married, or even wants to. At 23, that seems sensible. She may not know where she wants to go next, but she did manage to visit Pakistan in 2018. The beautiful Swat Valley she loves, and to see her grandmother and aunt before they died. You can read the Vogue interview HERE.June 2020Malala graduated from the University of Oxford with a degree in PPE  (Politics, Philosophy, Economics). The Oxford course has a remarkable number of famous politicians and public figures among its alumni, listed HERE. When the Coronavirus/Covid-19 pandemic subsides, may the world be her oyster. Image: Malala celebrating graduating, in traditional Oxford style (Source.)Review from 2016 of 2013 bookThis is a powerful story about a child, but with topical, global relevance.The media is full of alarming reports of extremists of all religions, across the globe. Finding perspective can be hard, especially for non-believers, and it’s important to balance valid criticism and condemnation with avoiding the suggestion that all followers of a faith are mad, bad, or dangerous to know.So it’s good to read a positive portrayal not just of a religious person, but a Muslim one. The fact she is young, female, and influential is all the better.Who Is Malala?People around the world know her by her first name. They know she campaigned for the right of girls to attend school, initially via an anonymous blog on BBC Urdu (aged 11). That she was shot in the head by the Taliban and eventually airlifted to hospital in Birmingham, UK - a city where she and her family currently live. That she has a very close relationship with her father. That she spoke at the UN on her 16th birthday. That she was the youngest Nobel laureate when, aged 17, she was joint winner of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize. That she’s a devout Muslim. That she’s a giggler.That, I knew. I read this to understand, especially why Ziauddin (her father) is so enlightened about women and their education; how and why Malala became a campaigner so young; the role and opinion of Tor Pekai (her mother, who was illiterate); and her two younger brothers, Kushal and Atal, raised in a culture that favours boys and men, but perpetually in the shadow of their sister.I learned the chronology, and a fair bit about Pashtun culture, the natural beauty of Swat, recent Pakistani political history, Taliban tactics, and the difficulty of living as a displaced person at home and abroad.I discovered that Malala loves Cheesy Wotsits, Justin Bieber, Ugly Betty, styling her hair, Twilight, halal KFC, gently teasing her father, high(ish) heels, pink, and squabbling with the elder of her younger brothers. She’s proud of her academic prizes because she earned them, but has mixed feelings about the others, because they remind her of how much still needs to change.She comes across as a charming mixture of serious and light-hearted, mature and child-like, loyal to her heritage, but open to other ideas and influences. The perfect example was doing henna hand tattoos using symbols from chemistry and calculus, rather than the traditional flowers and butterflies.But I still don’t feel I really understand the family themselves.Who are Tor Pekai and Ziauddin?Theirs was, unusually, a love match, rather than an arranged marriage.Tor Pekai may be uneducated and in the background, but “My mother comes from a family of strong women” and Ziauddin always shares information and decisions with her. He’s the dreamer; she’s the practical one. After Malala had been airlifted to the UK and the family were battling bureaucracy to join her, it was Tor Pekai’s threatened hunger strike that got things slowly moving.Ziauddin apparently overcame a childhood stammer by determination and public speaking. He was conscious of his preferential treatment for being a boy, particularly in terms of education, and felt that was wrong. He was briefly radicalised in his youth, but going away to college when Benazir Bhutto was PM, he discovered “women who had greater freedom and were not hidden away as in in his own village”. That seems insufficient explanation for founding a chain of schools against extraordinary odds, and speaking out against governments and terrorists. “It was my grandmother’s faith in my father that gave him the courage to find his own proud path.” Hmm.One answer to my questions is the fact that Ziauddin carries a version of Martin Niemöller’s famous poem in his pocket, First they came for....Whose Voice, Whose Truth?The more significant biographies will be written decades hence, but until then, this is an important and readable book, and I don’t want to diminish that. It is by Malala in conjunction with journalist, Christina Lamb. The writing can be a little uneven and plodding, I sometimes lost track of how old Malala was, and it’s not always clear to what extent her thoughts and words are really hers, or have been modulated, moderated or embroidered.Maybe it doesn’t matter. When the Islamic studies teacher couldn’t be trusted, her father advised, “Learn the literal meaning of the [Arabic] words; don’t follow his explanations and interpretations. Only learn what God says. His words are divine messages, which  you are free to interpret.”There’s a fair bit of mythologizing. “My father always said ‘Malala will be free as a bird’ but I wondered how free a daughter could ever be.” She was always special: the family’s luck changed after her birth, omens abound etc. “All children are special to their parents, but to my father I was his universe” – he had a wife and two other children!But given Malala’s life and stature on the word stage, mythologizing is perhaps inevitable and even appropriate. But.ControversyAlthough feted around the world, Malala remains a controversial figure in the country she loves, and to which she repeatedly and firmly says she wants to return.The extremists think her a puppet of the west, and too liberal in her interpretation of Islam. Even moderates dislike her for symbolising bad aspects of their country, and think her hypocritical for living in greater comfort abroad (as if it were her choice).The Pakistani government created the role of Educational Attaché in the UK for Ziauddin so the family would have income and diplomatic passports - and, crucially, not be eligible to claim asylum in the UK (which would make Pakistan look bad).What Next?“We might be the world’s best-treated refugees.” The Yousafzai family may live in greater material comfort now, but the pain and loneliness of their new lives, especially for Tor Pekai, is made plain.It’s not safe for Malala and her family to return to Swat at the moment. Meanwhile, she received an excellent education at an academically-selective private girls’ school in Birmingham - a city with a large population of Pakistani heritage. She’s two years older than the other girls in her class, but did well, after the initial shock of no longer being effortlessly at the top of the class. I assume her brothers are receiving a similar education. After that, there was speculation she might go to the US for university; the only certainty was that it wouldn’t be Pakistan. In the end, she went to Oxford to study the famous PPE  (Politics, Philosophy, Economics) course. While still at school, she reiterated the decision made aged 13 that she wants to be a politician, so Oxford's PPE, followed by many British and overseas political figures, makes sense. How and where she applies it remains to be seen. She’s certainly fearless and determined: she only agreed to meet President Obama on condition they could talk, rather than just have a photo opportunity, and when she was awarded Pakistan’s first National Peace Prize, she accepted it and then gave the PM a list of demands!Just as importantly, Tor Pekai is attending classes in English, reading and writing.Image: Malala celebrating graduating, with her family (Source.)Religion in My LifeI was raised as an Anglican (Church of England), at home and at school. A somewhat passive (non-evangelical) sort of faith, with dramatic architecture, good music, and beautiful words.In my late teens and early twenties, I earnestly sought a personal experience of God. There were times it felt close, but I never quite got there.Eventually, I gave up the quest, and was happier facing my truth. I dabbled in Dawkins and agnosticism, and am now at the stage where I am somewhat bored with the debate, and actively dislike organised religion and many of the beliefs that go with it.Nevertheless, I retain a visceral affection for the beauty of some religious practices (only some), and respect for good and sincere believers, including those among my family and friends.I don’t share Malala’s faith, but I admire her sincerity, courage, commitment, and passion for worthy causes. She has paid a high price. I hope she continues to think it's worth it.Good and Evil; God and the GodlessHistory is full of people who have done evil things in the name of religion (including those who shot Malala) and non-religious people who have done great and altruistic things. But we should not forget the opposite.Malala cites the Koran as saying “God wants us to have knowledge”. Her explicit religious faith may sustain and drive her, but she evangelises for girls, women, and education, rather than God. Even unbelievers and followers of other faiths can support her in that.She thanks God for saving her – but she’s keen to thank people, too. It also strengthened her campaigning resolve, “I was spared for a reason – to use my life helping people”.Maybe the truth is that the world has good and bad people in it, and that their religion is no more relevant than whether or not they like Justin Bieber.Quotes·	“My life has changed, but I have not.”·	“For us girls, that doorway was like a magical entrance to our own special world.

I don’t think it matters which is first.The film uses charming animated sequences to illustrate the legend of Malalai and scenes from the life of Malala’s parents.On screen, you see more of brothers and mother, a little more of Malala's personality – especially her famous giggle, get a feel for being on the receiving end of hordes of journalists at international events, and see some of the education projects the Malala Fund is sponsoring. However, it’s no more enlightening on the relationship between Malala and her parents than the book is.The book has more (gentle) mention of Malala’s own faith, more background in Pakistani culture and politics, more about Ziauddin’s motivation and the schools he founded, and covers the family’s difficulties in joining Malala in the UK.!121!ملاله دختری که در مورد محدودیت تحصیل مصاحبه کرد، توسط طالبان مورد سوء قصد قرار گرفت. در سازمان ملل صحبت کرد. جایزه صلح نوبل گرفت. این کتاب پرفروش رو چاپ کرداما بیاید کمی واضح تر نگاه کنیم. ورای این تصویرکه به ما داده شدهاز لحظه ای که این کتاب رو شروع کردم چیزی در موردش اذیتم می کرد. دقیقا نمی دونستم که مشکل کجاست چون واقعاً ""می خواستم"" که این کتاب رو دوست داشته باشم. می خواستم ملاله از انسان های مهم و تاثیرگذاری باشه که در موردشون خوندم. این حس من رو به ریویو های گودریدز و مقاله های موجود در اینترنت کشوند. بعد از خوندن تعداد زیادی نقد مثبت و تعداد اندکی منفی، مشکل رو متوجه شدم. شاید کمی از حقیقت ملاله و این کتاب پرفروش برای من روشن شدیک : ملاله در زمان نوشتن این کتاب یک دختر پانزده ساله ست. کودکی ملاله در زر ورق پدر و ویراستارش پوشانده شده، ولی در آخر دیده میشه و فکر نپخته اش خودش رو نشان میدهدو: قسمت زیادی به نقل قول و تاریخ جانب دارانه می گذره و آیا این تاریخ رو این دختر 15 ساله دیده؟ یا یک جستجوی معمولی شده و به ما تحویل داده شده؟ یا فکر فرد دیگه ای؟ نقل قول های بسیار از پدرش نشون میده که ما داریم تاریخ پاکستان رو از زبان مردی می خوانیم که مخالف بسیاری از مسائل هست، از کجا بفهمیم این تاریخ نزدیک به واقعیت هست؟ جستجو های من نشون داد که خیلی از جاها نیست. چرا این نسخه از واقعیت به ما نشان داده میشه؟چرا پاکستانی هایی که دقیقا در محل زندگی سابق ملاله زندگی می کنند، اصرار دارند که واقعیت چیز دیگری هست؟ سه : به عنوان کسی که در ایران زندگی می کنه به شدت درک می کنم اینکه در سطح جهانی تصویر عقب مانده ای از کشورت نمایش داده بشه چقدر آزار دهنده است و چطور توسط کشورهای دیگر برای پیشبرد منافعشون استفاده میشه. در روستاهای ایران هم ما مشکل آموزش و عقب ماندگی زن ها رو داریمولی آیا می تونیم این رو به همه ی ایران نسبت بدیم؟ملاله تمام زندگیش رو در نقطه دور روستایی ای گذرونده که حتی مدتی شامل پاکستان هم نبوده. چرا اصرار داره که این تصویر تمام زن های پاکستان هست؟ کشوری که نخست وزیر زن داشته و تعداد زیادی زن بسیار تحصیل کرده! منظور چشم بستن به روی مشکلات حقوق زنان و تحصیل یا انکارشون نیست. ولی نحوه ی مقابله با این مشکله که بحث برانگیزهچهار: و چرا ملاله؟ چرا این دختر لایق این همه میکروفون و درمان و توجه بود ولی دخترهایی که همزمان با ملاله قربانی این حمله شدند نه. چون ملاله خوب صحبت می کنه؟ به خاطر این ملاله لایق توجه دنیا بود و بچه های افغانی که در حملات هوایی آمریکا کشته شدند نه؟این رو پذیرفتم که هر هدفی نیاز به فردی داره که در نقش ""پوستر"" باشه. آیا ملاله کار واقعی ای بیشتر از پوستر بودن انجام داده؟ آیا مدارس جدیدی در سوات ساخته شده؟ صحبت های پاکستانی ها نشان میده که نهپنچ: میزان تمجید از خود در این زندگی نامه آزار دهندست.

That is not true. I was, as everyone else, a regular listener of the Taliban's daily half an hour or so long FM radio broadcast and they only verbally 'forced' girls to wear proper veils when going to school, which was hardly an enforcement as the local culture is already extremely conscious of the 'veil' (Mala herself wears a scarf). However, to my knowledge they 'encouraged' girls to leave 'western' schools but they 'claimed' that after installing an Islamic government here in the area, they would set up proper 'exemplary' girls schools. In fact, in the local tribal society it is unthinkable to 'force' a woman or girl from doing or not doing something as it is tantamount to man-handling them, which is, frankly speaking, a sure way to get killed or beaten not only by relatives (distant or near) of the woman/girl but anyone who is nearby. Anyone here can testify to fact that on various occasions many 'individual' talibans were mercilessly beaten up by locals when they spoke to shopping women reproachfully. Additionally, the Talibans were locals (later they were joined by savages from central Asian region and Afghanistan but they kept to themselves) and they never held absolute power here.. As opposed to the official stance, the people of Swat never left their homes when Talibans were in control, as a matter of fact, they were 'forced' to leave when army started the operation by the army. Secondly, Talibans were never in control of the city where Malala resided for so long as to impose their alleged rule. They entered the city in early May ( I was there buying DVDs with friends) by then the impending military operation had already caused educational institutions to close indefinitely. A week or ten days after the 'invasion' of the city (they, despite the hype, actually numbered not more than two or two and a half dozen who 'occupied' few private buildings and hotels) army entered the city. In any case, people started to leave the city after Taliban 'invasion' for fear of artillery and aerial bombardment by the army. Therefore, it highly unlikely that there were any female students still going to schools. This 'timing' problems also exist in her 'diary', dated January & February, which records the 'incidents' on her way to school. Valley Swat is officially a 'Winter Zone' and all educational institutions are closed for winter vacation on the 25th of December to 1st of March. Thirdly, no one is aware of anyone raising their voice for the general cause of girls education at any point during the uprising in any way or on any forum (since there was nothing as such called for). However, I personally am aware of two occasions where a relative(s), affiliated with the Talibans, tried to stop daughters or sisters of close relatives from going to school and were physically forced to abstain from any such acts in the future. I personally do not wish to malign anyone's reputation, especially not that of the adorable yet unfortunate Malala whose courage and personality I admire. However, as the history is been written, I would disapprove of any one who may, innocently, inadvertently or deliberately, represent truth in a distorted form. We were unfortunate enough to have had Talibans forced upon us, let us not be burdened with half-truths and tarnished representation. I am not alone in these perception, everyone share them here. That was the reason that the students of prime Girls College in the city here refused their college to be named after Mala.. In fact, the allegedly' repressed young girls vociferously protested out the college any such decision that forced the army and official authorities to relent.I am led to understand that there is a 'Malala Fund' with millions of dollars with the aim to spread girls education in my area.. May I respectfully ask when would a dollar from that money be spent here for the cause?!121!I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, Christina Lamb, Malala Yousafzai I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban is an autobiographical book by Malala Yousafzai, co-written with Christina Lamb. The book details the early life of Yousafzai, her father's ownership of schools and activism, the rise and fall of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat Valley and the assassination attempt made against Yousafzai, when she was aged 15, following her activism for female education. It has received a positive critical reception and won awards, though it has been banned in many schools in Pakistan.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و دوم ماه آگوست سال2015میلادیعنوان: من ملاله هستم؛ نویسنده: کریستینا لمب، ملاله یوسفزای؛ مترجم: هانیه چوپانی؛ تهران، کوله پشتی، سال1393؛ در344ص؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان پاکستان - سده21مدختر نوجوان «ملاله یوسف‌زی»، «پاکستانی» در سال2012میلادی، هنگامیکه از مدرسه به خانه باز می‌گشت، هدف گلوله ی تروریستها یا همان جنگجویان «طالبان» قرار گرفت؛ علت این ترور نافرجام، مخالفت‌های «ملاله» با احکام «طالبان پاکستان» درباره زنان، و دختران عنوان شده بود؛ با زخمی شدن «ملاله»، توجه افکار عمومی جهان به «ملاله»، خانواده‌ اش، و وضعیت زنان، در کشور «پاکستان» جلب شد؛ از آنجا که «طالبان» تهدید کرده بودند، که به محض بدست آوردن فرصت، دوباره به «ملاله» یورش خواهند برد، «ملاله» و خانواده‌ اش، برای درمان به «انگلستان» رفتند، و «ملاله» در آنجا بود، که دوباره سلامت خود را بازیافت؛ کتاب، شرح زندگی این دختر نوجوان «پاکستانی» است، که به قلم خود ایشان، و با یاری نویسنده ی روزنامه «ساندی تایمز»، نگاشته شده است؛ «ملاله»، پس از بهبودی، کوشش خود را، به عنوان فعال حقوق بشر، ادامه داده، و با حضور در مجامع گوناگون جهان، تلاش کرده، تا توجه جهان را به مشکلات زنان، و دختران، در «پاکستان» جلب نمایدنقل از متن: (من در سپیده‌ دم، در حالیکه آخرین ستاره چشمک می‌زد، متولد شدم؛ ما «پشتون‌»ها این نشانه را، بسیار خوش‌یمن می‌دانیم؛ پدرم برای مخارج بیمارستان، یا مامای خانگی، پول نداشت، بنابراین یکی از همسایه‌ ها، به ما کمک کرد؛ نخستین فرزند پدر و مادرم، مرده به دنیا آمده بود، اما من در حالی‌که فریاد می‌کشیدم، و لگد می‌زدم، بیرون آمدم؛ من دختر سرزمینی هستم، که تفنگ‌ها را، برای جشن تولد یک پسر، آتش می‌کنند، در حالی‌که دختران، پشت پرده‌ ای پنهان می‌شوند، و تنها نقش آنان، تهیه‌ ی غذا، و مراقبت از فرزندان است؛ برای اغلب «پشتون‌»ها، روز تولد یک دختر، بسیار غم‌ انگیز است؛ پسرعموی پدرم، «جهان شیرخان یوسفزی»، یکی از کسانی بود، که تولد مرا تبریک گفت، و حتی مبلغ قابل‌ توجهی، به پدر هدیه داد؛ او شجره‌ نامه‌ ی بزرگ خاندان ما را، به همراه خود آورده بود؛ «دلوخیل یوسفزی»، جد پدری من، تنها شاخه‌ ی مردان خاندان را، نشان می‌داد؛ «ضیاءالدین» پدرم، شبیه به هیچ‌ یک از مردان «پشتون» نیست؛ او شجره‌ نامه را گرفته، و یک خط، مانند آب نبات چوبی، از کنار نام خود ترسیم کرد، و در انتهای آن نوشت: «ملاله»؛ پسرعموی او، در حالی‌که شگفت‌ زده شده بود، خندید؛ اما پدر، به او توجهی نکرد؛ پدر می‌گوید، هنگامی که پس از تولدم، در چشمانم نگاه می‌کرده، شیفته‌ ی من شده بود؛ آن‌گاه به مردم می‌گفت: من می‌دانم این دختر، با بچه‌ های دیگر، فرق دارد؛ او حتی از دوستان و آشنایان خواست، که میوه‌ های خشک، شیرینی، و سکه در گهواره‌ ی من، بیاندازند، کاری که ما، تنها برای فرزندان پسر انجام می‌دهیم؛ نام من از «ملالی میوند»، شیرزن «افغانستان»، گرفته شد؛ «پشتون‌»ها قبایلی هستند، که میان «پاکستان» و «افغانستان»، تقسیم شده‌ اند؛ ما قرن‌هاست با قانونی به ��ام «پشتونوالی» زندگی می‌کنیم که ما را وادار می‌کند، با همه ی مهمانان خوش‌رفتاری کنیم، و مهم‌ترین ارزش در این قانون، ناموس است)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 12/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!لم أكن أتخيل للحظة أنني سأقع في غرام الكتابحسبت أنني سأتصفحه سريعا فإذا بي أستمتع بكل كلمة كتبت فيه وهو يتعدى الأربعمائة صفحة!!هل قلت وقعت في غرام الكتابالأصوب أنني وقعت في غرام هذه الفتاة القوية والشديدة اللطفأحببت كل ما كتبته عن نفسها وحياتهاأحببت عقلها الذكي وروحها الطيبةهناك ألوف مثل ملالا في كل أنحاء العالمفتيات منعتهن ظروف بشتى أنواعها من السير في الطريق الذي اتخذته ملالاحظت الفتاة بدعم وبحظ جيد لتوصل صوتها من العدل أن نقول أن هناك الكثيرات غيرهاممن لم يسمع صوتهن ولم تفتح منصات أمامهن للتعبير عما تعرضن له من ظلملكن هذا لا يغير حقيقة أن ملالا هي مثال رائع على الفتاة الشجاعة القوية الذكيةالتي استطاعت في مجتمع منغلق يتعرض لكل هذا الظلم أن تستمر وتناضل بكل ما استطاعتالكتاب وجدته متعة كبرىولم أمل من تفاصيله لحظةإنه تذكرة رائعة لما تستطيع المرأة فعلهإن هي عقدت عزمها على شيء!121!Just ignore the review if you think I write negatively.Edited to include what I have wrote earlier in my comments on 4 December '13:I do feel that this autobiography should have waited for a few years for Malala to have a much more distinctive voice.Unfortunately, this was muted by the co author.2.5 stars..OK shoot me!I actually hated this book, because the co-author named Christina Lamb actually used 3/4 of the book and sensationalise everything. EVERYTHING! That is why I am giving 2 stars for the 3/4 of the first part of the book. And this co-author put on dates and tragedies and events and it was like, I am in war all over.I actually enjoyed Malala Yousafzai retelling, on her father's dream, on her school, on her daily life. But when the other author start saying Pakistan is bad all over, oh hey, I got quite a few friends who are studying for their qualifications in the UK, and they turned out quite well. And they are men, and not Talibans.I know Talibans are wrong because they stop the girls for going to school and be educated. But there are some people who are not bad. The way Christina Lamb painted that all Pakistanis are violent (that's the vibes here) makes me want to smack her. I am a Muslim, BTW, and this co-author who is living in London is trying to say Muslims are bad.. oh heck.But for the second part, 1/4 of the book, it will be 3 stars. This is because Malala's voice has become more prominent later in the book. And I do love and enjoy her stories after she survived that Taliban shooting in her school bus.OK if I can survive this auto biography, maybe I will survive other horrid books.!121!انها ملالا....ملالا الفتاة التي ناضلت من اجل حق التعليم ملالا الفتاة التي لا تعرف المستحيل,ولا تخاف من اي شيئ سوى الله .ملالا الفتاة الشجاعة التي لم تخاف حتى من طالبان دافعت عن حقها كفتاة ملالا الفتاة التي وقفت في وجه اعداء العلم والدين الذين يريدوننا ان نعود الى العصر الحجريملالا الفتاة التي تعرضت الى محاولة قتل اثناء ذهابها الى المدرسة . ولكن الله كتب لها عمر جديد.ولم تنتهي حياتها بالرصاصة رائعة هي قصة ملالا ,تعلمنا ملالا الصبر وقوة العزمية وعدم اليأس ففي الفصل الاول تحكي ملالا يوسفزاي الحياة الجميلة والهادئة في مسقط رأسها مينغورا ,كبرى مدن وادي سوات قبل قدوم طالبان .تستعرض حياة والديها وجانب من علاقتها بعائلتها والتقاليد التي تميزت بها منطقتهاأما الفصل الثانى والذى يحمل عنوان ""ظل فوق وادينا""، خصص للحديث عن التغيرات التى نجمت عن ظهور طالبان، وخاصة معارضة تعليم البنات، وتهديد العائلات التى ترسل فتياتها إلى المدارسالفصل الثالث، يسرد قصة بداية ملالا فى طريقها للدفاع عن حق بنات جيلها فى التعليم، عندما كتبت العديد من المقالات والخطابات التى عبرت عن احساسها ومشاعرها تجاه حملات منع الفتيات من التعليم وحرق مدارسهم،بينما يحكى الفصل الرابع من الكتاب حكاية وتفاصيل محاولة اغتيال وقتل ملالا، ويوضح الفصل أنه قبل تنفيذ عملية الاغتيال، كانت تصل إليها عدد كبير من رسائل التهديد إليها ولغيرها من الفتيات اللواتى كن يتعلمن فى مدرسة خوشال،وفي النهاية الفصل الخامس يتحدث عن رحلة ملالا في العلاج ، وماعانته . وتروى فيه التغيرات النفسية والفكرية التى مرت بها نتيجة اضطرارها لمغادرة وطنها والعيش فى المملكة المتحدة، حيث مازالت تقيم هناك اليوم!121!I absolutely loved this book. I have been following this story ever since Malala Yousafzai was shot and articles about her began to appear on CNN.com. I was always captivated by the way Malala spoke in interviews before she was attacked: I simply loved the sound of her voice and the sight of her face, which seemed to shine with her spirit. She might not think she is beautiful, but to me she is stunning. I adore the bright colors she wears and the liquid wonder of her eyes.It was difficult to read about the shameful, cowardly attack on her, from her own POV. I empathized so much that it was painful to hear the details--some of which she could only describe as being what was told to her about the shooting.On the other hand, I will always remember one statement she made. ""A Talib fires three shots at point-blank range at three girls in a van and doesn’t kill any of them . . . I know God stopped me from going to the grave. It feels like this life is a second life. People prayed to God to spare me, and I was spared for a reason— to use my life for helping people."" It will always give me chills to think that it is amazing indeed that a Talib gunman fired three bullets, intending to kill one young girl--and that, unbelievably, he failed. I find it very hard to argue with the idea that Malala was, in fact, spared for a reason.The parts I enjoyed most about this autobiography were the beginning and end, where Malala speaks about her home, the Swat Valley, and everything that she loved and was proud about there: from her amazing father who, unlike most Pashtuns, celebrated when his wife gave birth to a daughter, to her best friend Moniba, with whom she giggled and played with, and who was also her rival for top of the class at at Kahshul School.When Malala described an ordinary day in her old life, fighting with her younger brothers, listening to the village women who would gather at her mother's in the afternoon, I was absolutely charmed. It seemed that there was no ghostwriter and that I could hear Malala's voice speaking the words aloud as clearly as I had heard her speak on videos about her mission to help all girls, everywhere, get an education. I was fascinated to read that Malala was named after the brave Malalai of Maiwand, the greatest heroine of Afghanistan, and startled and concerned to read about the Pashtunwali code, by which all Pashtuns live, which deals with honor, but which demands revenge in kind for any attack or killing and can lead to never-ending blood-feuds easily.When it came to the terrifying attack and all that happened in its aftermath, I was glued to the book, reading page after page with breath-snatching speed. There was so much that I had never even imagined: the suffering of her parents after the shooting, the story of how they worried about ever seeing their daughter again once Malala was airlifted to England. I think that any reader from ten years on up could read and be just as captivated as I was. Although many parts of this story brought tears to my eyes I couldn't stop reading, and although I knew that Malala would make it I was white-knuckled while I learned about the details of her medical treatment.The only part that seemed to bog down was the middle of the book, where Malala describes many political events in her homeland. In these it seemed that Malala’s voice was obscured and I rather quickly got lost in the details of which leader promised what and how this or that man became corrupt and never came through on their promises. Even if you just skim through this part, the book is most definitely worth reading. I came to love Malala even more dearly than I could have imagined, and to admire and even envy the bond she had with her father, the man who was determined to open a school in which girls could be educated. I couldn't help but feel great affection for all Malala's family, her people, and everything in the beautiful valley she misses as she lives in exile. I was hoping that Malala would win the Nobel Peace prize this year, not out of pity for someone who was a survivor of a hideous attack, but simply because I believe she has had an amazing effect on the world. She has brought together people from all over the globe in a way that I believe will have profound implications for the key to a better life for women in countries where it is currently against the law for girls to have a true education. I also thought that it would be stunning if the Nobel committee acknowledged that a teenager—a teenage girl—could have had so great a role in making people of different cultures understand each other. But Malala has plenty of time, and I have no doubt that she will distinguish herself again and again with her moving speeches, her gentle, stubborn nature, and her unique view of life in years to come. I hope that there will be more books by Malala in the future about why education is so important for girls around the world. Finally, I would like to say “Wah wah” to Malala about the entire autobiography. She says that this is what one says when a particular line or stanza of a poem pleases you, and is a bit like “Bravo.” Wah wah and Bravissima to Malala.!121!A few days prior to her 18th birthday, Malala Yousafzai has returned to Oslo, to attend the Oslo Education Summit, insisting that all children worldwide have a right to education. Her defiant slogan claims, ""Books not Bullets!"" Malala claims, ""I measure the world in hope, not doubt"" and ""Pens and books are the weapons that defeat terrorism"". Last year in Oslo, Malala was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with another child rights activist, Kailash Satyarthi. They were honoured ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education"". At 17, Malala was the youngest person ever to receive this award; Malala Yousafzai is indeed a determined and remarkable person. In this book, I am Malala: the girl who stood up for education and was shot by the Taliban, she tells her incredible story.The book is an absorbing read, an amalgam of Malala's own memoir, plus a history of the troubled country of Pakistan. Most readers will have lived through some - if not all - of the times described, unlike the author, startlingly only 15 herself when she wrote it. To many of us this is not ""history"" but merely remembrance of current events happening elsewhere in the world during our lifetimes. Could she have a proper grasp of such complex issues of current affairs? Malala is fluent in Pashto, English, and Urdu. She is articulate, brave, compassionate, informed, driven - and very focused. Growing up at the heart of an area targeted by the Taliban, she had a unique experience living under a developing regime of terror. When Osama Bin Laden was eventually discovered in hiding, it was, to everyone's shock, just a few miles away from where Malala herself lived. Along with the guidance and influence Malala's activist father has had on her, perhaps she was destined to become the person she is.The book starts with a prologue, briefly describing the day when she was shot, from Malala's point of view. The name ""Malala"" means ""grief-stricken"". Malala was named after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poetess and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan. It was an unusual name, which many thought to be unlucky or inappropriate. Reading her account, it is clear that her father knew from the start that there would be something different about this child. Malala was allowed to stay up at night and listen to all his political conversations with his friends, long after her two brothers had been sent to bed. She was encouraged to read and think; to have a mind of her own. The Yousafzai family were part of a large Pashtun tribe in the Swat Valley in Pakistan. Her family consisted of her father Ziauddin and her mother and two younger brothers. They were very poor, but part of a strong community in Mingora. There were comparatively few modern amenities such as running water and electricity; waste disposal and disease were a big problem, but the valley itself was lush and beautiful, and Malala thought her home was wonderful.This first part of Malala's story is entitled ""Before the Taliban"". Malala describes her grandparents and parents' history, how events had shaped each generation in her family. There was her father, an outspoken poet and education activist, who overcame his chronic shyness to learn public speaking to impress his own father. There was her more traditional, uneducated mother, who too began school at the age of six - but stopped before the term was over. Malala includes many family anecdotes, explaining the varying cultural mores as she does so, and interspersing the account with the troubled political history. The section has 8 chapters, and is over a third of the book. It takes the reader carefully though all the difficulties Pakistan has faced since its creation on 14th August 1947. Malala relates the views of her people, who regretted the loss of Swat's identity when it joined Pakistan. Additionally, the creation of a ""home for Muslims"" within Pakistan's boundaries was established too hastily, inevitably resulting in other faiths such as Hindus fleeing across the border to India. Economic chaos ensued, and peace has never yet come about. Since then, Pakistan has suffered under various regimes. There have been three Indo-Pakistan wars, several military coups, and numerous unsuccessful attempts at a military coup. The regime has lurched between military rule and democracy, between dictatorships and brief periods when a Prime Minister such as Benazir Bhutto was in power. She served two terms, but was eventually killed, clearly assassinated, although Malala carefully chronicles the muddled events. Pakistan has had varying degrees of both political and police corruption and is in constant turmoil. It is remarkable that any normal life can survive such conditions, but the life Malala describes is a happy one. Her father's greatest love apart from his family was the Khushal Public School which he established. The values of education ring clear and true throughout, having been instilled in Malala from a very early age. She also begins to develop her own opinions, drawing from her experience. One shocking episode helped to crystallise her views. Malala came across some scavenger children, who lived inside a huge mountain of rubbish. They had matted filthy hair, were dirty, diseased and covered with sores and lice. Picking out cans, bottle tops, glass and paper from the rotting pile of rubbish, they would sell them to a garbage shop for a few rupees, barely enough to live on. Malala begged her father to take a couple of these starving children into his school without pay, and inwardly vowed that she would work as hard as she could towards a time when every one of those children would have an education by right. In the meantime she wrote a letter to God, and sent it down the Swat river. Towards the end of this first section, it is apparent that the Taliban's influence had begun to be felt in the Swat valley. Across the border in Afghanistan, the Taliban had enforced a very strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. In horror folk learned of the massacres, the brutality towards women, the denial of food to ordinary people, the burning of homes, crops and land.Malala explains that the majority of the Taliban were made up of Afghan Pashtun tribesmen, simple ignorant people who had always been looked down on by many educated people, including those poor themselves, such as Malala's family. Recruits were resentful of any who had advantages, such as good jobs, and easily influenced by a fundamentalist idea of Islam. Seeing an opportunity to seize power, with weapons in their hands, they took it. There were many variations of interpretation of Islam present in Pakistan, not to mention other religions, but Malala's people could see others fleeing for their very lives as the regime continued. They were equally suspicious of the US, thinking that they inflamed the situation, causing innocent casualties. The local ""Mufti"", a religious leader, was making decisions for the whole community. He was very critical of Malala's father's school; the girls should not be seen, they must be segregated. They should not learn certain inappropriate subjects. He made increasingly outrageous statements, such as that Ziauddin was running a ""harem"" in his school. Purdah was insisted upon for younger girls, and more strictly. The Mufti was determined to enforce his own brand of Islam; individual interpretation was quashed.The section ends in 2005, when a massive earthquake in Pakistan killed over 70,000 people. Fundamentalists seized on this as a sort of punishment, a seal of approval on all their edicts. The second part is entitled, ""The Valley of Death. Malala is now 10 years old, and she describes the arrival of the Taliban in her village. A self-proclaimed Taliban leader named Maulan Fazlullah had risen to power, through a popular local radio station in Swat, appealing mostly to the ignorant and uneducated. In his radio broadcasts he offered instruction on how to obey the Quran. He soon had many followers - including Malala's own mother. His demands became more strident and fanatical, calling for an end to televisions, DVDs, and other modern technology. The public humiliations began of anyone who didn't obey his interpretation of the law, including women who did any work outside the home. The 7 chapters in this section are primarily about the suppression of the people of Swat, and the growth of Taliban influences. Some of the episodes referred to - the beatings, the beheadings - are harrowing, despite this being seen through the eyes of a young girl. Malala's education continues, but the reader is wondering for how long this can continue. Many girls have been taken away from the school and sometimes Malala is the only girl in her class. Very competitive, she has two close friends, equally clever.As time passes it becomes increasingly difficult for Malala to study. Military tanks are in evidence everywhere. On one occasion, travelling in a relative's car, the driver panicked, asking her to hide a CD of music in her clothes. Malala often began to feel afraid when on the streets, imagining that every man she met was a member of the Taliban. She and her friends stopped wearing their school uniforms and hid their books as they travelled to and from school. The beatings and beheadings continued. A nearby school was bombed during a prayer service in honour of a fallen police officer.When Malala is 11, she is approached by the BBC who feel that a child's viewpoint would be very significant. She is asked to write an anonymous blog about her life, and chooses the pseudonym ""Gul Makai"". People she knows, including some of the girls at school discover it but she wisely keeps it secret. The Taliban's powers are increasing. They have instructed families to send them the names of marriageable women, so that marriages can be arranged for them. They have announced a date in 2009, by which all girls' schools must be closed, yet Malala keeps hoping that something will prevent this. She becomes bolder and more confident, being taken in 2008 by her father to Peshawar to speak at the local press club. She has written a clear and passionate speech, ""How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?"" Inevitably though, the final day of school arrives. Malala cannot believe it; her books are her proudest possessions. She is followed around by a camera crew from the New York Times, making a documentary. Her life seems empty without school, and increasingly the family are living in fear of their very lives. Malala compares their existence to a family of which she has just read, in ""Anne Frank's Diary"". Deciding they will have to leave their home, Malala's family, like many others, flee to relatives. Others flee to friends, even though this means that in some homes the males have to leave. The Pashtun tradition of hospitality conflicts with the belief that an unmarried female should not reside in the same home as a male who is not her relative, but they respect both principles. Malala goes to school again with a cousin. She is now 12 years old, although everybody is living in too much turmoil to mark her birthday in the way they always had.The third part is entitled, ""Three Bullets, Three Girls"". We know what this section is going to be about, but now we also feel we know the girl herself; her history, and how her individual experience slots into the mess and bloodshed that is Pakistan's inheritance. It is three months later, and Malala's family return home to find much of their village destroyed during the battles. The Taliban has gone, the Pakistani Prime Minister promises, but many people don't believe it. Some return and eventually school resumes, but many stay away. During these 5 chapters, Malala's beliefs become more fully formed. She wonders what it would be like to leave school at 13 to be married, just as one of her classmates has. The climate of opinion changes. There are still tanks on every street corner, machine guns posted on rooftops, checkpoints all along a route, but now people blame the US. Why were they still there, 3 years later? There was even outrage at the American raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. The details were unclear. Why had the US conducted the raid on their own, without telling the Pakistanis or seeking help from them? Conspiracy theories abound. Had the Americans perhaps even actually killed bin Laden years earlier?Clearly the Taliban are still present, carrying out atrocities very close to their home. On Malala's 14th birthday, when she is officially considered to be an adult, the family learn that one of Ziauddin's outspoken friends has been attacked. Malala agrees to follow her mother's advice, and even though the school is so close, she takes a rickshaw to school, and the bus home. The section ends with the shooting which made world headlines. On 9th October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Malala through the head, neck, and shoulder as she rode home from school on the bus after taking an exam. Although Malala can remember very little about it, being preoccupied with her own thoughts, the masked gunman apparently shouted, ""Which one of you is Malala? Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all"". Her identity became obvious, at which point he shot at her. Two of her friends, Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, were also wounded, but survived.Part four is entitled, ""Between Life and Death"". It contains just 2 chapters, about a time of which Malala can remember very little. Immediately following the attack, she was rushed to Swat Central Hospital. There she remained unconscious, in a critical condition. The political machinations behind the scenes continued. The chapters give clinical details, and credit one doctor, ""Dr Fiona"", for preventing Malala's death when staff neglected to follow specialist procedures necessary for the brain and body to recover. She insisted that Malala be sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK for intensive rehabilitation. Her parents were not able to travel to see their daughter, due to protocol. What comes across to the reader is the ignorance apparent at every level, but also a sense that it is possible for individuals to overcome this, even when the odds seem stacked against them. The final, fifth part ""A Second Life"" also consists of 2 chapters. Malala now tells of her recovery more from her personal experience. By 17th October, she had come out of her coma and begun to repond. She was terribly worried about the cost of her treatment, thinking that her father would have to sell his land. She still had not been able to see her father. Eventually everything progressed to the point where the Pakistani government paid for her treatment, she was able to be visited by her family, and best of all, she had no lasting brain damage, only nerve damage. On 3 January 2013, Malala was discharged from the hospital to continue rehabilitation at her family's temporary home. On 2nd February she had a five-hour operation to reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing. Since March 2013, she has been a pupil at the all-girls' Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. Although happy there, she evidently misses her old life, and would love to go home some day. She realises that her new classmates regard her as a children's rights activisit, but sometimes longs to just be the normal simple Pashtun girl of old, in Minora ...The co-author of this book is Christina Lamb, a British journalist who is currently Foreign Correspondent for the Sunday Times. Her credentials for helping to write this particular book are impeccable. She first interviewed Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in London in 1987. She then continued her work as foreign correspondent in Pakistan, journeying through Kashmir and along the frontiers of neighbouring Afghanistan. She has interviewed the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Always working in war-torn countries, she was even once deported back home. Commenting on the worsening devastation and destruction by the president Robert Mugabe and the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front since she started reporting from Zimbabwe in 1994, she maintains that this has been her most harrowing experience. In 2006, Lamb was reporting from Southern Afghanistan, meeting with town elders. The team were then supposedly directed to a safe route out, but soon after they had left, the British were attacked by Taliban fighters. Anyone who experienced running through irrigation trenches, with Kalashnikov rifles and mortar firing from all directions, for two and a half hours, is well qualified to co-author this book. Immediately after this book she wrote another about her many years in Afghanistan and Pakistan. She is critical of many missed opportunities by the US, to help resolve the long war, blaming the poor relationship US has with Pakistan for many of the continuing problems of terrorism.Interestingly it is possible to see the seeds of that book within this one. Often the voice of Malala seems critical of the US, and their inability to be effective, even a mistrust of American troops. But whose is the underlying voice? It is impossible to really know.Other parts of the book suggest the hand of an experienced foreign affairs correspondent. The indepth knowledge of both contemporary issues and the country's history and political situation, as well as of the many different tribes, languages and customs within each region, is so very extensive. The issues are complex and quite difficult for the general reader, only aware of the basic schism between Sunni and Shia Muslims, to assimilate. The roots of the split are ancient, originating in a dispute soon after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Sunni Muslims such as Malala's family follow the orthodox and traditionalist branch of Islam, which takes as its precedent the actions of the Prophet Muhammad. Shia Muslims are followers of Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, whom they claim as Muhammad's successor, believing that only God has the prerogative to appoint the successor to his prophet. But there are massively complex distinctions between all the different factions within both Sunni and Shia. Could the complicated issues explored all be Malala's work?However Malala is an erudite speaker and writer. I have no doubt that the views, anecdotes, and probably the structure of the book are hers, and that the passion with which she explains her views is hers alone. It is well balanced, her own experience set within the ongoing political situation. But perhaps there is slightly too much input from history to make the memoir flow easily. Malala is a courageous, intelligent, indefatigable person. I would have loved to say this book merits 5 stars. It very nearly does, and I have a sneaky feeling that if she is ever inspired by events in her life to write a book again, it probably will.The subtitle of the book is, the girl who stood up for education and was shot by the Taliban. Malala insists that surviving being shot in the head is not what she wants people to focus on, but the issues of children's rights, women's education and world peace. Surely that is what we should take away from reading this book.""Our people have become misguided. They think their greatest concern is defending Islam and are being led astray by those like the Taliban who deliberately misinterpret the Quran ... We have so many people in our country who are illiterate. And many women have no education at all. We live in a place where schools are blown up. We have no reliable electricity supply. Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani.""!121!I would ask all those Pakistanis who are making the book controversial through over-sensationalized and misplaced critiques: 1. Please remove the lenses of bigotry and prejudice and read the book in a casual way. Its not a great book so comparisons with Anne Frank's diary are perhaps out of proportion. However, I would hate to speculate that it might be considered a great classic if Pakistan continues on its usual disastrous course and experience a people's tragedy comparable to holocaust. This in my humble yet optimistic view is impossible, God willing.2. It is not even a well-written work either; understandably so, since its from a young girl. Its just an ad lib commentary by a 16 year old girl which is most probably composed by Christina Lamb in readable English. Our so-called second grade media intellectuals who have issues with Lamb's reputation, well Yousufzai is not synonymous with Lamb. At least try to add a minimum possible of degree of objectivity in your criticism. 3. When you quote, please do so with the purpose of discussion and critique rather than ridicule. Please learn to read and understand the texts. They are meaningless and misleading without a context. Those who are calling it interpretation of her father's ideas, well what if I may ask is wrong with that? All 16-year olds think their fathers are cool. We, as fathers and mothers, have right to impart our version of goodness into our children. We may disagree with each others' views but disagreeing with other's interpretation of history, politics and social issues doesn't make one anti-Islam or anti-Pakistan.4. It might be a very interesting work for western audience, specially when Lamb ostensibly lets Yousafzai speak (in my view Lamb has added historical and political bits to it where necessary for coherence of discourse), but have very little for Pakistani reader in terms of engagement with the text. However, what you must understand is that you are reading a very brave girl who can stand eye-to-eye with adversity and horrors in conditions where most of us would end up compromising with our liberty or would simply run away. She is a brave girl, mentored and taught life by an audacious father. We must be proud of her and listen her carefully since we have a young hero towards whom we can point our children to look-up to.Lastly, lets try to read the same book the author has intended to write; please don't end up reading the book which you intend to criticize, apriori!121!I was caught in a dilemma as to what rating should I give this book. I vacillated between 4 and 5 but the message contained in the book made me give it a 5 star rating.Needless to say this book chronicles the dreams, hardships and dangers faced by Malala - but it is much more than that - it also chronicles the hardships and dangers faced by the people of Swat and the people of entire Pakistan as well as.The book begins about the day when the Talibans shot Malala and then goes on a flashback. We get to know about Malala's family, Malala's father's struggle to set up a school, the social customs of the Pashtuns, a short lesson about the factors that led to the rise of extremism in her country, government apathy towards the masses, army inaction, the sheer terror of living under the extremists etc. We would also get glimpses of Malala as the young girl she is - whether fighting with her brothers, best friends, enjoying TV series.I had read about the atrocities committed by the extremists in newspapers but reading a first hand account of the victim somehow made it more terrifying. Malala only wanted the right to go to school and she was shot for it. As children, most of us hated having to go to school and there are people in this world who fight and risk their lives for this privilege.Many people say with forceful conviction that it is education which can put an end to this extremism and end many of the injustices prevalent in this world. I agree but somewhere there is a small doubt which keeps nagging me. In the papers I have read about young people, of both sexes, hailing from well-to-do families and having the privilege of attending good schools and colleges, gravitating towards extremist ideologies. Then there is something seriously wrong with the education system of the world - i say world because this is happening in many countries, and the authorities should think about it.I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading good books.!121!3.5 starsMalala is one of my idols and i've had my eye on this book for a very long time. I listened to this on audio, and the prologue of this is read by Malala herself. I cried three times just in that first half hour listening to her talk about her story. For the first third of this book, I was convinced that I would be giving it five stars. I love what Malala stands for and I think we got such a vibrant description of her life and I loved that we got to know sort of ""a day in the life of Malala."" She felt so real to me, like I was one of her school friends. But then toward the middle of this book, there was about 2 hours of infodumping. The story switched from an explanation of Malala's education and her life to an explanation of Pakistan and different leaders and terrorist regimes ruling and political drama, and although others might think this adds great info to the story, history/politics does NOT interest me whatsoever, so I found myself almost returning this audiobook just because I was so miserably bored. I stuck with it, though, only skim listening (is that a thing????) and it finally returned to events regarding Malala for the last third of the book. I agree so much with what Malala is fighting for and I think her story is really tragic but encouraging. I wish this book had focused less on giving us a history lesson, and rather Malala could have gone into depth about the topics she's passionate about. I will be purchasing a physical copy of this, and I would recommend it to you if you support Malala!!121!This is the story of Malala, the brave girl who defied fear and baseless traditions just to get educated. *Highlights:🔸The place where she grew up in Pakistan: Swat has been described in detail🔸Real pictures: lots of them; even the photos taken on the way after she was shot; during her treatment & after she got discharged from the hospital has been well documented🔸Her father. I read the whole book in awe just beacuse of her father. The way he celebrated when she was born when everyone around was mourning the birth of a girl child : it was too good to read again and again.🔸Her father needs special mentions everywhere as he is the main reason who has made her into the person she is today.He is a teacher who has given his all for the education of the children and everyone else who was denied of the opportunity of getting educated.🔸Malala is just not an ordinary girl as we all know, but this book provides insights of so many things that we do not know.Overall, this was a detailed, beautifully written book.I would recommend this book to everyone: kids and adults alike.The beginning pages of the book tends to be a bit longer and it may get too detailed about places, the geography and history but are relevant I feel. The writing makes it somehow easier to read (I am not a great fan of history and geography, and facts given in details). A real life young adult female warrior who fought for her rights against all odds!What's fiction when real life becomes more interesting, thrilling and life-changing?Yes, this memoir made me feel that for the first time.Every girl child deserves education. Every girl child deserves a father like that.!121!I am SO late to the party here - I have a toxic trait of avoiding books when they're popular - but I'm so glad I finally read Malala's story of growing up in a progressive family in Pakistan, standing up for girls' rights to an education, and making it through a traumatic attack meant to silence her. This was incredibly beautiful and inspiring.Click here to hear more of my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive!!121!Malala e o Poder das PalavrasMalala tinha apenas 10 anos quando os talibãs invadiram o Vale do Swat no Paquistão, terra onde vivia.Com a ocupação talibã as raparigas fôram proibidas de frequentar as escolas. Porém, Malala não permite que sejam os talibãs a ditar-lhe o Futuro. O seu Sonho é ser médica e pretende lutar por ele. Cria um blogue onde informa o resto do Mundo sobre as medidas repressivas impostas ao seu país pelos talibãs e reconquista o regresso à escola. E a sua luta não acaba aí -- Malala não pensa apenas em si, e continua a intervir pelas restantes raparigas que, tal como ela, anseiam pelas asas da educação.Mas essa luta teve um preço: um dia, dois talibãs introduzem-se na camioneta onde regressava da escola e um deles dispara 3 tiros sobre ela. Mas Malala sobrevive milagrosamente, exila-se em Inglaterra com a família e prossegue o seu Caminho...Malala lutou, sobreviveu e as suas armas fôram as Palavras, essas Grandes Guerreiras sempre que lideradas por Causas Justas!!!A história de Malala, toca-nos, revolta-nos, inspira-nos... e instiga-nos a ser melhores!5 gloriosas estrelas! 🥰!121!This book was better than I thought it would be. To be honest, teenagers aren't usually good writers. I read Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board and wasn't very impressed, even though I think what happened to Bethany Hamilton was interesting.Same thing here. Was this just going to be a case of ""important/interesting subject matter, crappy writing?"" I didn't know. I went into this rather hesitantly, with low expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There is a supporting author on this, one Christina Lamb - who is one of Britain's leading foreign correspondents. Who knows how much of this book is Lamb and how much of it is Yousafzai, but who cares? I found it very informative, educational, and interesting. It's not very emotional or rant-y or sappy - and that is going to upset some people. A friend of mine IRL who just finished this said it was 'boring.' He wanted more feelings and emotions from Yousafzai. I, however, was very pleased. I learned a lot about Pakistan, what it is like living under Taliban rule, and what life is like in the Middle East in general.DO read this book if you are looking for an educational, easy-to-read, straight-talking look at life in the Middle East during turbulent times.DO NOT read this book if you want weeping, sobbing, gnashing of teeth, or other emotional outbursts on the part of Yousafzai. Her ambition is to be a politician - and it shows. This is very much a politician's book. Even-keeled and conscious of saying the right thing and presenting the right face. I didn't mind this, but I could see how it would bother some people.One plus is that the book has photos - I always enjoy non-fiction books more if they include photographs of the people involved. You can see many pictures of Yousafzai growing up, all her family members, the bus she was shot in, her in the hospital, etc. etc. I thought this added a lot to the book.Yousafzai is very Muslim and is a very religious person - but she is also a great advocate for girls and women's education. It's important nowadays to separate the ideas of ""Muslim"" and ""psychotic terrorist/religious extremist"" in our minds, especially in the U.S. of A. and other countries in which it seems a strong anti-Muslim sentiment is growing. Reading this book will put a human face on Islam even if it does nothing else for you.Tl;dr - I really enjoyed this - if only because I felt like I learned a lot from it. Yousafzai paints a vivid picture of what living in the Middle East in the 2000s is really like. Of course, I already knew what had happened to her and how her story would end... everyone knows her story. So there were no surprises for me here. This has been on my reading list for a long time and I'm glad to have finally read it.!121!Honestly this proved yet another attempt by this girl to cash in on fame and £££. All the time she kept on praising her dad, disparaged and belittled her country of orgin which I have serious doubts after reading this literature.If she was so annoyed with Swat being a part of Pakistan why does not she openly say that I am not a daughter of Pakistan rather daughter of swat. She has further cemented the mistake West has made over the years. You see each area in Pakistan has its regional customs in addition to Islamic customs and traditions. She failed to clarify that What Pashtuns or Taliban are soliciting is a cocktail of Islamic and Pashtun traditions. Islam never debars any Muslim from seeking education. Our Prophet Muhammad May Peace Be Upon Him solicited that seek knowledge even if you have to walk to China. Also education and knowledge attainment is mandatory for Muslim women and men.I'd like to enlighten the western public that science practicals and computer labs are available in Pakistani educational institutes. The access may be shared among students but availability is there. Being a graduate myself from UK mu college had a computer lab which had a designated area for me. If I required to load a laptop I had to furnish a written request and wait in a queue.Most alarming thing for me was that Pakistani's oppress women. This could be attributed to rural areas but not at all applicable to cities or urban towns. We have doctors, teachers, accountants, nurses, air force and commercial pilots. More than a decade ago Islamabad witnessed Pakistan's first lady cab driver, a widow who purchased a cab on hire purchase under the then Prime Minister's initiative. Thank God I did not purchase this book otherwise it would have been a waste of £7.49 of my hard earned money.So Who so ever has read this book please my earnest appeal is to consult the Holy Quran and also if possible do visit Pakistan and then decide.Till then May Almighty be with you and bless you!121!This story made me cry, hope and it mesmerized me. What a woman. What she did for all of the oppressed people she was a part of, is honorable. Getting stronger by it, ready to move the world in a better direction is truly a miracle.!121!Malala is such an inspiration to me. Going into this book I already knew quite a bit about her but I loved hearing her first hand experiences. I also enjoyed learning more about this history and politics in Pakistan. I can see how this part might be boring to people, but being the history buff that I am I loved it.!121!‎دوستانِ گرانقدر، این کتاب هیچ نکته و حتی داستان و سرگذشت خاص و ویژه ای ندارد... زندگینامهٔ دختری نوزده ساله و پاکستانی به نامِ «ملاله یوسف زی» که توسط طالبان ترور شده بود و با آنکه گلوله به صورتش برخورد کرده بود، زنده ماند‎نوشته هایِ کتاب بدون تردید به قلم این دختر نوجوان نمیباشد.. چراکه من چندین بار صحبتهای این دختر را شنیده ام، او حتی سخن گفتن عادی را نیز به سختی انجام میدهد، هیچ از مسائل ادبی و نویسندگی و حتی نقد نمیداند، چه برسد به آنکه کتاب و زندگینامه بنویسد... دلیل ترورش را هم اینگونه گفته است که: چون برای ""بی بی سی"" ایمیل میفرستادم و از حقوق زنان پاکستانی و ظلم طالبان مینوشتم، مرا ترور کردند... امّا دوستانِ عزیز و خردگرا، همه میدانیم که با عقل و خرد جور در نمی آید که طالبان وقت و هزینه بگذارند تا به دنبال ترور یک دختر بچهٔ پانزده ساله باشند‎باید این حقیقت را بگویم که حتی این کتاب نیز توسطِ «کریستینا لمب» خبرنگار انگلیسی نوشته شده و ویرایش شده است، امّا بازهم به دروغ آن را به «ملاله» نسبت میدهند و میگویند او نوشته است‎این دختر نوجوان برندهٔ جایزهٔ صلحِ نوبل نیز شده است، ولی برخی مردمِ نادان و بیخرد و دولتِ پاکستان ارزشی برای این جایزه قائل نیستند، چراکه از طرفی مسلمان هستند و دینِ اسلامِ نابِ محمدی، اندکی ارزش برای جنس زن قائل نمیباشد و از سویِ دیگر این جایزه را غربی دانسته و اهدای آن را به «ملاله» تنها سو استفاده های سیاسیِ از سوی کشورهای غربی قلمداد میکنند‎بسیاری از زنان و دختران بیگناه هستند که در سرزمین های اسلامی به آنها ستم روا میشود و با آنها همچون حیوان برخورد میکنند، چراکه دینشان اینگونه خواسته است و هیچکس یاری رسانِ این دختران بیگناه و بیچاره نیست و کسی صدای آنها و درد آنها را نمی شنود‎در کل آنقدر رسانه ها این دختر نوجوان را بزرگ کردند که در حال حاضر همراه پدرش یک صندوق مالی تأسیس کرده و نام آن را «ملاله» نهاده است و در سال میلیون ها دلار به این صندوق واریز میشود و معلوم نیست او و پدرش با این پول ها چه میکنند.. قرار بوده است که این پول ها حامی دختران ستم دیده باشد.. امّا چقدر راست گفته اند، کسی نمیداند!! و تا آنجا که میدانم کمکی آنچنانی نیز به دختران دربند و گرفتار پاکستانی دیده نشده است... گویا این پول های بی زبان باید جمع شود تا در آینده «ملاله» به قولِ خودش نخست وزیرِ پاکستان شود‎درکل کتاب جالب توجهی نبود... نمیدانم چرا برخی احساسی برخورد کرده و امتیاز بالا به این کتاب داده اند.. امتیاز بالا به این کتاب دادن به نوعی بی ارزش جلوه دادن و ظلم به زندگینامه های معروف و مشهوری است که در تاریخ نگاشته شده است... حمایت از «ملاله» و دیگر زنان و دختران مثل او، هیچ ربطی به امتیاز دادن به این کتاب ندارد و امیدوارم این را درک کنید که امتیازهای ما به نوعی معرفی کتاب برای خرید میباشد و خیلی ها به امتیازهایِ ما نگاه کرده و کتابشان را انتخاب میکنند.. پس عزیزانم، در خرج کردن ستاره هایتان کمی احساساتتان را کنترل کنید و معقولانه امتیاز بدهید و ارزش های نویسندگی را زیر سؤال نبرید و معیارهای مختلف در نویسندگی را در نظر داشته باشید--------------------------------------------‎امیدوارم این ریویو مفید بوده باشه«پیروز باشید و ایرانی»!121!Affecting but disjointed, I Am Malala recounts the extraordinary life of the internationally renowned Pakistani activist. Partially written by a ghostwriter, the memoir scans Malala’s childhood and adolescence as well as the recent history of Pakistan, but it addresses neither subject comprehensively. An excessive amount of information about Pakistani society is presented piecemeal, leaving much unclear; these passages overwhelm Malala’s own story, without ever giving a clear sense of the country’s politics, government, or culture. The transitions between the life writing and the explanatory prose also tend to be clumsy, and the writing feels rushed. The book is at its best when it focuses on Malala’s goals, beliefs, and accomplishments, but it’s clear that a more thorough (auto)biography remains to be written.!121!Unless you've been living in a cave the past couple of years-- the name Malala Yousafzsi -- rings a bell with you.... The young heroine who first survived under chilling conditions - taken over by Taliban extremists... and how her entire family stayed afloat. Malala is a stand for education. A stand for women and especially female children getting an education. Sincerely passionate about educational injustice --- taking a shot in the head for it----she became the youngest person ever to be nominated and win the Nobel Peace Prize. When you begin to look through the eyes of this young girl- politically-you can see a young girl aware of the lies and distortions she had been feed from her Government. The difference is..., many of us, can remember being 16 years old, also aware as injustice in our world, yet we didn't stand alone- speak out... fight .. ( as if our lives depended on our fighting), for injustice in the world to the level this young girl did. So, yes.. This young girl was very brave.. ( everything people have said about her is true). Under horrific conditions... she kept speaking out.. at the risk of her safety. She herself is truly remarkable. As far as the book itself.., it could have used some editing! Some parts were choppy-& disjointed - other parts felt immature, ( we are reminded that Malala 'is' still very young). Some parts, of course, we're painful- heartfelt- moving- but much was inspiring... because Malala is inspiring. As brave as this young girl has been-- she is also a girl easy to support. The entire world knows who she is now. With the right type of guidance -and support -we should see more great contributions from Malala throughout her adulthood. Malala is young powerful force.....,A Symbol of oppressed women fighting for education and other human rights.!121!I'm not sure how to do a review for this book, but here goes!The context and information was more in depth then I was expecting and I loved I Am Malala.While reading this, I realized that being an American woman is such a privilege. I've never had to struggle and survive for education, not having the right to vote or even walk alone into a store to shop. I've always had freedom, free speech and democracy for the things that I take for granted.After reading this book, I've realized getting first hand information is the way to go. It opens up your eyes and mind to what's really going on.Malala lived in Pakistan when she was attacked and dealt with Islamic terrorists every day. I was amazed with how strong and brave she was in staying the course for girls education. Her father was equally brave in keeping the school going, promoting peace and not having the Quran twisted to influence evil acts and misunderstanding.I see this behavior in every religion and I don't like it.Can't we all just love each other and get along? Quit the judging, live the best life that you can live and stay out of other people's business?*getting off soap box now* 😉🤣*ahem*Back to Malala and this book.I enjoyed the history that was brought up in this book along with all of the complexities to Pakistan, Islam and who's trying to control the country. I also enjoyed reading about how families and neighborhoods related with each other. The writing was well done and I never felt like I was lost on the information.One last thing.As Malala said,""One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world.""And I really believe in this quote. Education and facts will be how this world will survive. Misinformation, hate and ignorance will cause all of us to fail.!121!3.5 starsMalala Yousafzai inspires me so much. Her human rights advocacy for education and for women has transformed into an international movement; her courage to keep fighting after getting shot exemplifies her heroism. Her voice has reached so many and has influenced history. She has impacted the world by speaking out, and she writes about her father's support as well, adding back story to her honest desire to make a difference in the realm of Pakistani politics and female education.Saying all of that, my rating of I Am Malala pertains in no way to Malala herself. I felt that this book fell short in portraying Malala's story: it jumbled up Pakistani history, politics, and Malala's own experience in a way that did not make much sense. The book's disjointed, impersonal structure disappointed me, and I wish we could have read a more linear, cohesive narrative all from Malala's viewpoint. We all know the power and wisdom of Malala's voice; I would have enjoyed I Am Malala if I had heard more of it.If you want to learn a little more about Malala's upbringing, Pakistani history, or the Taliban, I would still recommend this book. It does a good job of sharing Malala's story, even though it could have done a lot better.","['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Autobiography', 'Audiobook', 'History']"
I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer (ebook),Michelle McNamara,4.12,235827,2018,"A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.""You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark.""For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called ""the Golden State Killer."" Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.","**Update 4/26/2018 - When this book was published it was an unsolved mystery. It got a happy ending yesterday.**I'd heard about Michelle McNamara before I even knew her name or that she was a true crime writer. She was married to comedian/actor Patton Oswalt, who I’m a big fan of, and several of his bits over the years have involved his wife. Per Patton’s descriptions in his routines she was a brilliant woman, far smarter than him, who was always operating at a whole other level. Now I know what he was talking about after reading this book. It’s about a pure monster that should be one of the best known unsolved crime cases in American history, but many people have probably never heard of the Golden State Killer. It began in 1976 with a serial rapist terrorizing the suburbs of Sacramento. His MO was to break into homes in the middle of the night and surprise sleeping victims who he’d threaten with knives or guns. He often targeted couples or families and would rape a woman while her husband or boyfriend was tied up helpless in the next room. He’s also believed to have shot and killed a couple who had the misfortune to encounter him while out walking their dog.His attacks spread to communities outside of San Francisco, but seemed to stop in mid-1979. Unfortunately, GSK had just moved south to the LA area where he started up again, but his first known attempt was thwarted when the couple fought back, and he narrowly escaped capture. Instead of scaring him off this triggered an escalation after which GSK would kill those he attacked until stopping in 1986, ten years after he began.The full extent of the damage he’d done wasn’t known until DNA typing of cold cases was done in 2001. This confirmed what several detectives in various jurisdictions had suspected for years. The man called the East Area Rapist (EAR) during his crime spree in northern California was the same man who’d become known as the Original Night Stalker (ONS) in the southern part of the state. The statistics of his victims alone are staggering with over 50 women sexually assaulted and 12 murders. He may have also been responsible for a series of break-ins in Visalia a few years earlier, and if so there’s another murder to hang on him there for shooting a man who stopped an intruder from abducting his daughter in the middle of the night from their home.It was Michelle McNamara who branded him the Golden State Killer after she began writing about the case on her blog and in magazine articles. She had became interested in true crime as a teenager after an unsolved murder of a young girl happened near her home. A big part of this story is about how this case came to obsess her, and she does not make an attempt to gloss over how much it took over her life. She has one story of asking her husband to leave a movie premiere party because of a new lead she was given that she couldn’t wait to get back to her laptop to start working on it. There’s another heartbreaking moment when she describes an anniversary dinner with Patton where she realized that not only had he given her gifts two years in a row based on her on-going work on GSK, but that she had been so consumed that she’d forgotten to get him anything at all. Unfortunately, Michelle died unexpectedly in 2016 while in the middle of writing this book. Two of her fellow researchers finished it at Patton’s urging, and I’m very glad that happened because it would have been a shame if the work she did on this hadn’t been revealed so fully. She was an incredibly gifted writer who can provide detail about GSK’s crime in such a way that we feel the full weight of what he did, and how incredibly scary this story is. It’s there as she details the evidence the police found that showed that GSK was a relentless night prowler who crept over fences, through backyards, across rooftops, and peeped windows from the shadows. It’s in the way she tells us the stories from the victims who were very often sound asleep in their beds and were awoken by a man wearing a ski mask shining a light in their eyes, showing them a knife, and telling them that he’d kill them if they didn’t do exactly what he said. While it never feels exploitive she conveys all the ways that the surviving victim’s lives were changed by the attacks on them. When she describes a detective’s years of chasing dead ends you can feel the frustration, and when she tells the story of a new lead you also start tapping into the hope that this might be the one to break the case.In addition to being a great writer Michelle was a relentless researcher. I sometimes have issues with books or documentaries about true crime cases because I think it too often it shows confirmation bias or prefers wild conspiracy theories to more likely mundane facts and scenarios. She avoids those by imposing clear and logical standards to this which depended on fact checking and interviews rather than indulging in hunches or pet theories. It’s very clear from what she wrote here that Michelle believed that this case could be solved with technology. The cops have the DNA of the Golden State Killer to use as the ultimate determination of guilt or innocence. Geo-Mapping his crime scenes should give an approximate location of where he lived. Scanning old case files and using key word recognition and data sorting can bring previously hidden connections to life. DNA databases are growing all the time, and all it takes is one hit from a relative to narrow it down to the family.* Michelle was convinced that GSK’s identity was in the existing evidence somewhere, and it’s just a matter of sifting through all the clues to find it.Because of her death there several parts that rely on her early drafts, notes, old magazine articles, and even a tape she made of the conversation between her and a police detective while showing her some of the GSK’s crime scenes. That gives the book a bit of a disjointed feeling and makes you wish even more that she’d been able to finish it herself, but considering the circumstances it’s unavoidable and doesn’t prevent the full story from being told.This will be going on my Best-of-True-Crime shelf, right next to In Cold Blood. And if they do ever catch the Golden State Killer I’ll bet it’s going to be due in no small part to the work of Michelle McNamara.* This is exactly how the police eventually tracked him down.!121!“He loses his power when we know his face.”
And, it seems, we now do.I can see why everyone speaks so highly of this book. It is a very impressive piece of investigative journalism, whether true crime stories happen to be your cup of tea or not. What makes  I'll Be Gone in the Dark stand out - and what you might have seen come up time and again in other people's reviews - is that the writer is perhaps as fascinating as the subject.It is the late Michelle McNamara at the centre of this piece - an intelligent and particularly astute woman who dedicated everything she had to pursuing the Golden State Killer, a moniker which she herself bestowed upon him. It is her dedication that is truly astounding. The lengths she went to in order to uncover the truth are quite unbelievable.As the subtitle tells us, this was indeed an obsessive search. That's not just a dramatic buzzword. Behind the scenes of her daily life with her high-profile family, Michelle was hunting. She was scouring the Internet and the past for clues. She was reconstructing crime scenes, talking with witnesses, analyzing the evidence and building her own psychological profile of the killer. Gillian Flynn writes in the introduction:
“I love reading true crime, but I’ve always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else’s tragedy. So like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best: writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane.”
And McNamara is definitely all those things. Her work and writing never seem sensationalist. Her reconstructions of the disgusting crimes are detailed, but not in a gratuitous way. She writes sensitively with a deep sense of empathy for the victims, wishing, it seems, to paint them as more than just a list of victims from decades ago, but as three-dimensional human beings who lived through unspeakable tragedies.This book is so popular that I know most of this has been said already, but I'm just really glad I finally gave in to the hype and read  I'll Be Gone in the Dark. It is especially satisfying to know this man has finally been caught, and my only lingering disappointment stems from the fact that Michelle didn't live long enough to see it. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube!121!That summer I hunted the serial killer at night from my daughter’s playroom. For the most part I mimicked the bedtime routine of a normal person. Teeth brushed. Pajamas on. But after my husband and daughter fell asleep, I’d retreat to my makeshift workspace and boot up my laptop, that fifteen-inch-wide hatch of endless possibilities…I rarely moved but I leaped decades with a few keystrokes. Yearbooks. Marriage certificates. Mug shots. I scoured thousands of pages of 1970s-era police files. I pored over autopsy reports. That I should do this surrounded by a half-dozen stuffed animals and a set of miniature pink bongos didn’t strike me as unusual. I’d found my searching place, as private as a rat’s maze. Every obsession needs a room of its own. Mine was strewn with coloring paper on which I’d scribbled down California penal codes in crayon.  - from the prologueI’ll Be Gone in the Dark is not just a tale of a decade-long crime spree, of a maddeningly elusive peeper, burglar, rapist, and murderer. It is not only a tale of obsession, as the author, and others with her particular inclination, bury themselves in the forensic, statistical, genetic, and geographical trail left by this relentless offender. It is a story as well of how some dedicated active and retired police, and private citizens worked hand in hand to try to track down a homicidal monster. It is also a story of the impact that monster had on the communities he terrorized and on how advances in technology over several decades shortened the distance between suspicion and apprehension.Michelle McNamara hard at work - image from The Times - provided to them by Patton OswaltMcNamara had always wanted to be a writer, but she gained some focus on what to write as a teen.
[Her] fascination with the grisly began when she was just 14, when a young woman named Kathleen Lombardo, whom McNamara knew from church, was murdered while jogging a block and a half away from McNamara’s home in Oak Park, Illinois. The man who slit Lombardo’s throat was never found. McNamara would be forever haunted by what she’d later describe as “the specter of that question mark where the killer’s face should be.”  - From Vulture articleShe takes us along with her, introducing readers to three general groups of people, the victims, the professional investigators, and her small band of amateur sleuths. These are not deep profiles, but we are given enough about each to understand their roles in the ongoing drama, and their motivation. Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office sketches of a masked man who had fled a crime scene in 1979 and an artist’s impression of the killer – image from The TimesThe first crimes took place in the 1970s, the last known GSK crime was committed in 1986. He began with simple burglaries, dozens of them, enough to earn a tabloid name, The Ransacker, then moved on to rape. One of his victims was thirteen. The tabloids called him the East Area Rapist (EAR) and the Original Night Stalker (ONS), often merging the two to EAR-ONS. He was nearly caught after one couple resisted, so, to ensure not only compliance, but that there would be no witnesses, he moved on to homicide. His home invasions were well planned, professionally executed, and particularly cruel. It was not enough to rape women. He made many of the women tie up their husbands or boyfriends, and forced them to watch him commit the rape. He had a signature technique for monitoring whether the male victims moved. Movement, they were told, would get their partner killed. And sometimes he killed them anyway, both of them. During her research, McNamara coined the GSK tag for him, the Golden State Killer.Attacks attributed to the GSK – image from the Sacramento County DA’s office by way of the NY TimesMcNamara takes us through not just the clues that accumulated over the years, but methodologies for looking into them. There is some very surprising information here on what happens to old police files. We follow along as new methods are added to tried and true shoe-leather investigation. There were two major technological breakthroughs over the four decades of the investigation. DNA fingerprinting was the first. And even once it was put into widespread use there were still problems with local police departments coordinating with other PDs. She walks us through how that changed. The other major item is what you are using right now, the internet. All the information in the world is useless without the ability to connect a fact here to a crime there. The internet, McNamara predicted, was what would eventually allow for the apprehension of the GSK. It is quite cheering when McNamara begins to connect with other cold-crime obsessives across the country, and they begin sharing theories, and sometimes actual evidence. It was an incredibly long investigation, and such projects come with some built-in risk.
falling for a suspect is a lot like the first surge of blind love in a relationship. Focus narrows to a single face. The world and its practical sounds are a wan soundtrack to the powerful silent biopic you’re editing in your mind at all times. No amount of information on the object of your obsession is enough. You crave more. Always more. You note his taste in shoes and even drive by his house, courtesy of Google Maps. You engage in wild confirmation bias. You project. A middle-aged white man smiling and cutting a cake decorated with candles in a picture posted on Facebook isn’t celebrating his birthday, but holding a knife.
As with the infamous Kitty Genovese incident in 1964, how people react not just to crime but to neighborhood security in general comes in for some scrutiny here.
That’s what we all do. All of us. We make well-intentioned promises of protection we can’t always keep.I’ll look out for you.But then you hear a scream and you decide it’s some teenagers playing around. A young man jumping a fence is taking a shortcut. The gunshot at three a.m. is a firecracker or a car backfiring. You sit up in bed for a startled moment. Awaiting you is the cold, hard floor and a conversation that may lead nowhere: you collapse onto your warm pillow, and turn back to sleep.Sirens wake you later. 
People did react in some ways. Sacramento saw a spate of residents trimming trees and uprooting bushes to deny cover to the GSK, installing floodlighting, reinforcing doors, sleeping with hammers under pillows, and buying thousands of guns. Victim support groups formed, some of the victimized men joining neighborhood patrols. Community safety meetings were packed. There were some positive impacts from GSK’s dark deeds, though. 
The case had a profound impact not just on fear and public safety in California, but also on the way that rapes were investigated and how rape victims were treated, said Carol Daly, a detective in the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office at the time…Rape victims were seen and cared for faster, and pubic hair, scratches and other evidence were examined and preserved, she said. Rape kits were standardized. “Every victim went through the process,” she said.  - From 4/25/18 – NY TIMES articleWhen my wife was reading this book, some time ago, she became a bit paranoid safety conscious, jumping at small unexpected sounds, then wanting to investigate (in a house with as many cats as we have, unexpected noises are abundant) making extra certain that our windows and doors were locked, watching a tick or two longer than usual at people passing by (living next door to a pizzeria, they are legion), keeping the lights on a bit longer than usual when going to bed. Point being that the book, while hardly a horror novel, can indeed induce a serious case of jitters. And why not? The nutter of which McNamara writes was not caught during the decades investigators private and professional worked the case. He was still on the loose when McNamara passed away, McNamara’s writing skills are considerable. She keeps the narrative moving, slickly evading the potential peril of death by excessive detail. She reports on some of the gore the GSK generated, but not too much, not nearly as much as she might have. She has an ability to clarify the forensics, while keeping us in touch with the terrors experienced by the victims, and the hopes and frustrations of the diverse posse on the GSK’s trail. Occasionally a particular passage or turn of phrase will make you sit back and sigh in appreciation, but the narrative chugs on and each particular gem is allowed to please, then recede into the rearview. The pair who took on the task of completing the book when McNamara died retrieved some fine samples from her notes. For example,
 He was a compulsive prowler and searcher. We, who hunt him, suffer from the same affliction. He peered through windows. I tap “return.” Return. Return. Click Mouse click, mouse click…The hunt is the adrenaline rush, not the catch. He’s the fake shark in Jaws, barely seen so doubly feared.
McNamara died in her sleep, in April, 2016, at age 46, from a combination of drugs interacting with an undiagnosed medical condition that caused a blockage in her arteries. She had been stressed out from working on this book, putting in long hours and suffering anxiety and nightmares that kept her from sleeping. Her husband engaged researcher Paul Haynes and investigative journalist Billy Jensen to complete the book McNamara had worked on for so long, and with such dedication. 
A week after Michelle’s death, we gained access to her hard drive and began exploring her files on the Golden State Killer. All 3,500 of them. That was on top of dozens of notebooks, the legal pads, the scraps of paper, and thousands of digitized pages of police reports. And the thirty-seven boxes of files she had received from the Orange County prosecutor, which Michelle lovingly dubbed the Mother Lode.
The GSK burglarized more than 120 homes, raped dozens of women, killed at least ten people, and at least one dog during the 1970s and 1980s. We do not know how many people he drove mad in their decades-long inability to find him, or how many lives were ruined as a result of his crimes. The good news is that in April 2018, only a few months after the publication of Michelle McNamara’s book, a 72-year-old man, Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested, based on DNA evidence. The Golden State Killer is finally in jail. He had not killed anyone in thirty years, as far as we know, but it is in the nature of such sprees to have a strong impact long after the events themselves. Meg Gardiner, who grew up in Santa Barbara, in one of DeAngelos target neighborhoods, tells of the experience of terror during the period of the killer’s mayhem. 
Yesterday my brother texted: “I have a different feeling driving around the neighborhood today. It was always in the back of my mind that he could still be living around here. In a weird way it feels safer.”It does. The fear is gone. But the shadows remain.
So does Michelle McNamara’s work, her legacy, a major contribution to finally locking up a long-sought monster.HBO has bought the rights and plans to develop I’ll Be Gone in the Dark into a documentary mini-series.Joseph James DeAngelo, 72 – believed to be the Golden State Killer – image from Sacramento County Sheriff’s OfficeReview posted – June 15, 2018Publication date – February 27, 2018December 2018 - I'll Be Gone in the Dark wins the 2018 Goodreads Choice Award for non-fictionThe HBO series of I’ll Be Gone in the Dark begins June 28, 2020==========In the summer of 2019 GR reduced the allowable review size by 25%, from 20,000 to 15,000 characters.

I'm not crying. You're crying.Original Review, 11/16/17: Confession: I'm what you would call a murderino. I listen to My Favorite Murder religiously, I watch the hell out of Investigation Discovery (City Confidential is amazing), and I listen to a few other podcasts. Sadly, I never read Michelle McNamara's work until after her death. After reading a few articles, I saved reading the rest until after I read this book. I'm going to try not to fangirl all over the place, but this was stunningly amazing. It was such a personal story. McNamara shared so much of herself in this book without overwhelming it, and you really feel her dedication in the text. Her personal touch helps distract from the dehumanizing brutality of the crime very effectively. In a weird way, I almost felt like I had gained a friend during the book, like I was in the car driving with her or scanning through text-filled databases in the middle of the night, too, and that's a difficult feeling to evoke, especially in this genre. Likewise, the story focuses on the many of detectives (both law enforcement and less official sleuths) who worked the case and the victims as much as it does the killer. While you get to know McNamara and her story, you also get to know the generations of detectives and their tenacity, frustration, heartbreak, and courage. The suspense builds and falls as the investigators chase leads, then stall, and all the while, you hope for the big break in a way they've learned to not bet on so earnestly.The ending, however, is a little bittersweet. You know going in that the GSK remains uncaught and about McNamara's death, but both still hit me hard. Yet, throughout both McNamara's text and the ending by follow-up authors, there's an unwavering conviction that they'll catch the responsible one day, and when I finished the final page, that sense of resolve was the strongest emotion I felt.A few random things I loved worth mentioning:1. McNamara's unmistakable empathy for the victims, the detectives and LEOs, and the communities;2. She was never gratuitous describing the rapes or murders, yet she didn't sacrifice attention to detail or suspense;3. Likewise, she acknowledged the complexity of the crime and how difficult it's been to catch the GSK because of it, but never festishized him, either. 4. (This might sound weird, but I've heard and read some accounts where they make rape sound like erotica or it's uncomfortably detailed and you want to throw the book across the room and clean it in bleach);5. She had such truly excellent, beautiful, and suspenseful writing.tl;dr: Seriously, I'll Be Gone in the Dark shows such exceptional, suspenseful writing and beautiful dedication. I cried at the end in the best of ways.pre-read: Of course, when I have four freaking books with a holds list that I have obligations to read, you, my beautiful love, come into my life, after I've been pining after you for months. You're only the book I've been most looking forward to ALL YEAR.!121!Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I had a feeling I would be the dissenting opinion on this one right from the start when the author performed a Google search for some stolen cufflinks based off of a sketch (not an actual picture) and swore she found the exact items (for a bargain price of $8 even) and that she would be able to identify the original owner/identify the perp due to the fact that “names starting with the letter N” weren’t very prevalent on the Top 100 Baby Names list at the time and also thought it was perfectly reasonable to Ziploc baggie the things and present them to the police (because DNA evidence would still be present 30 years later??? Zoinks). I stopped watching Nancy Grace once my firstborn started sleeping through the night and I wasn’t held prisoner by the lack of viewing options at 2:00 a.m., thank you very much.I feel I need to disclose that I received an Advanced Reader’s Copy of Patton Oswalt’s book . . . . that I still have not read because he broke what is left of my dried out rotten apple of a heart when his wife died unexpectedly and he shared how shattered he was and I can’t bear to even think about picking the damn thing up to this day. That being said, I understand why getting I’ll Be Gone In The Dark to print was so important to him. But it’s MY belief that reviews should be honest - and honestly??? I don’t get the hype. I don’t think McNamara’s writing is particularly brilliant unless you are interested in what type of clothing and music were popular at the time of a crime rather than details of the cases (not to mention the fact that she only wrote half of it before she died, making it EXTREMELY choppy); the timeline itself is 100% disjointed and hops from past to future to past again without rhyme or reason; despite the “EAR” or “ONS” or “EAR/ONS” being responsible for 50+ crimes hardly any are covered in this book; and last, but certainly not least, McNamara doesn’t seem to have had too much insight into the case at all, but rather an obsession/borderline addiction where conjecture rules and fellow couch commandos are considered experts (if you’ve ever been on a site like Websleuths or the like, you’ll know the exact opposite is true). Bottom line is: I don’t think this would have ever been published were it not for her husband being famous and making it happen as part of his grieving process. Good news for everyone involved is that the Golden State Killer wound up being caught which gave I’ll Be Gone In The Dark new life and a sort of cult following and very few people who want to go on record as “poo poo-ing” it due to McNamara’s untimely death. Obviously I drank the Kool-Aid because I read the thing too. I’m just also willing to shit on everyone else’s sundae.!121!(3.5) An interesting topic, an impressive woman and research... but not my jam.I would recommend the audiobook as I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I had read it myself!!121!A very enjoyable read!TW: graphic depictions of rape/assault/murderThough true crime is a great field of interest to me, I haven't read many books of this variety. I was pleasantly satisfied with my time reading I'll Be Gone In The Dark. The narration was vivid and engaging. I appreciated the feeling of it being almost like a memoir from McNamara's perspective rather than just stating facts about the case. My only struggle with the book was that it was hard to keep track of EACH victim and EACH detail of their individual cases. The order of them became muddled as I delved deeper into the book, but it's possibly not due to the writing itself but factors of my personal experience, such as choosing to listen to the audiobook version or my lack of knowledge of true crime novels in general. Though, I did see another review claim the events are not revealed chronologically throughout the book, so that's also a potential factor!Overall, a great read and a great listen! Would definitely recommend to my fellow true crime fans. This books is full of detail and great value towards closing this case.!121!Halloween is just around the corner and it's time for some spooky books - but which ones are worth your time?

The Written Review




Open the door. Show us your face.Walk into the light.
The Golden State Killer began as a rapist and transitioned to a murderer - he reigned over California for over a decade...and then he just disappeared. Gone. Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist, became interested in this cold case thirty years after it was published.
I love reading true crime, but I’ve always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else’s tragedy. 
 She ran a popular website - called TrueCrimeDiary.com - and soon her mere interest became an obsession. 
He loses his power when we know his face. 
And so the search began.Using the technology of today to track down this elusive killer.
I lamented to one of them that I felt I was grasping at straws. “My advice? Grasp a straw,” he said. “Work it to dust.”
She chronicled her journey and the evidence she gathered in this book I'll Be Gone in the Dark but before she could publish, she died. But this book is one that was meant to be finished because hidden within its pages may be the evidence that finally unmasks this murderer. 
He pointed a knife at her and issued a chilling warning: “Make one move and you’ll be silent forever and I’ll be gone in the dark.”
Whew. I don't read much true crime because - like the quote above - it feels a bit weird, intrusive even, to read about someone else's tragedy. But there was something that compelled me to pick up McNamara's book and I'm so glad I did.It was so wonderfully written, the evidence was crazy and the overall feel of the book was amazing.So many twists and turns - I found myself holding my breath and crossing my fingers as we approached the ending.It's definitely not one I'll forget.

It was a pleasure to listen to this following the capture of Joseph Deangelo, and it's excruciating to think that Michelle was so close to unveiling one of the most notorious serial rapists and murderers in US history. If you haven't managed to snag this one yet, I highly recommend listening to the audiobook if that's your thing; all the narrators were beyond excellent and audible has all the pdf downloads available to view alongside while listening. Highly recommended for fans of true crime and those looking to get a glimpse not only into the EAR, but also Michelle's personal life and struggles as well. All of the stars. <3!121!Update 8/11/2019 - I just finished the new season of Veronica Mars on Hulu. In it, Patton Oswalt plays a character who is obsessed with solving cold cases and other crimes the police are struggling with. As soon as I realized that is what his character was and how much it reminded me of his wife as described in this book, I began to wonder if he was offered the role as a tribute to her . . .4.25 starsI guarantee you will not be able to read this book without many stops to do Wikipedia and Google maps searches. Just do yourself a favor and don’t read too much on line before you finish the book – it is much more suspenseful that way.I’ll Be Gone In The Dark is a posthumous collection of narratives, notes, dialogue, and other evidence collected by McNamara that she was working into a book that she never got to see come to fruition. Because of this, some of the parts are polished, while other parts are raw, and some may even feel disjointed. I think if she had lived to see it through, it would have come across as much cleaner. However, I don’t think this is a bad thing. It is kind of fascinating to see a snapshot of an investigation before it is ready and complete. Not only is who the Golden State Killer is a mystery, but where McNamara was going with her notes is a mystery as well.One interesting aspect of this book is that it has a lot of autobiography of McNamera as well. Often, true crime is just a compilation of the details with the author’s involvement being of little or no importance. Another true crime mainstay, Ann Rule, became involved with the story in her book The Stranger Beside Me, as well as in her book about the Green River Killer (Green River, Running Red). I definitely think it is interesting to see an involvement in the investigation beyond just researching, compiling, and regurgitating information. The personal touch and commitment is felt very strongly!With that in mind, I feel like the key takeaway from this book is how obsession works on both sides. The killer rapist had his meticulous modus operandi that allowed many crimes covering a wide area to be connected by certain evidence. The author had her daily routine of web searches, library visits, travels to 30 year old crime scenes, etc. which frequently led to frustration and tears. Without the criminal, there would have been no need for the investigation. Without the author, many unsolved mysteries could have been relegated to cold case status forever. Unfortunately, she didn’t live to see if her obsessive dedication led to any success.I think this is a true crime book worth the time of any fan of the genre. As is often the case, some of the content matter may be difficult for some, so proceed with caution if you are sensitive.Click on this next part only if you have finished the book and done some follow-up research:Shortly after finishing and discovering at the time of publication the killer still hadn’t been caught, I had to jump online and do some searching. I thought I had heard that the killer had been caught, but was wondering if I remembered something else. Sure enough, earlier this year, DNA evidence led to the capture of the killer! (I will leave you to your own web search if you are interested in the details) What I hope they do is either some follow up chapters or a whole new book that takes the evidence that McNamara tracked down over the years and compares it against the person found to be the killer. One of the keys to her investigation is trying to figure out where his home base might have been and correlating the events to the actual life, occupation, etc. of the killer. It would be interesting to see how that all matches up and if it shows any other patterns that they missed.!121!This one didn’t quite do it for me. I found the story interesting because I knew absolutely nothing about this killer that got away (not a spoiler). The development of the methodologies to apprehend criminals was fascinating and many of the terms are commonplace today. It’s an uneven book and I found myself mentally re-writing sentences for clarity. The messy sentences (in places) may be the result of piecing together a book from the deceased author’s notes and trying to retain her voice. It’s worth reading if you are a fan of true crime.!121!There are only very few books that fascinate us and scare us at the same time. 

 This is one among them. Golden state killer is a topic I have heard multiple times during my childhood in various magazines, newspapers, and the media. Michelle McNamara did a spectacular job of helping find the Golden State Killer. The way she pushed the need to study genetic genealogy to nail down the killer's identity was remarkable. From creating the website, TrueCrimeDiary.com to interviewing victims and spending endless hours, she was determined to solve this case.
My favorite three lines from this book. 


 ""I love reading true crime, but I've always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else's tragedy. So like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best: writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane.""


 ""We swim or sink against our deficits in life."" 

 ""He loses his power when we know his face."" 
The way the author functioned to solve this case will fascinate you, and you can read this part like an investigative thriller. The way the mind of the psychopath - the killer worked might shock you to the core. This book is one of the best examples of crime journalism, and you should never miss it if you love reading books related to crime journalism.—————————————————————————

No butler, no second maid, no blood upon the stair. No eccentric aunt, no gardener, no family friend smiling among the bric-a-brac-and murder. Only a suburban house with the front door open and a dog barking at a squirrel, and the cars passing. The corpse quite dead. The wife in Florida. Consider the clues: the potato masher in a vase, the torn photograph of a Wesleyan basketball team, scattered with the check stubs in the hall; the unsent fan letter to Shirley Temple, the Hoover button on the lapel of the deceased, the note: ‘To be killed this way is quite all right with me.” Small wonder the case remains unsolved, or that the sleuth. Le Roux is now incurably insane, and sits alone in a white room in a white gown, screaming that the world is mad, that clues lead nowhere, or to walls so high their tops cannot be seen; Screaming all day of war, screaming that nothing can be solved- Weldon Kees, “Crime Club”What a fitting epigraph! This book sincerely scared the crap out of me. I grew up in the seventies, one of the creepiest decades, filled with terrifying serial killers and rapists, but I was not familiar with this case. This book reminded me of how taut the atmosphere was in those days, as the author details her hunt for a prolific serial rapist, which eventually escalated to murder, who went on a virtually unchecked rape and murder spree in California in the seventies. The author dubbed the killer ‘The Golden State Killer’, as she slowly pieced together the evidence and the many victims, working tirelessly to put a face and a name to the moniker she’d give him. Michelle was a true crime journalist, who started the website, ‘TrueCrimeDiary.com, as this case became an obsession with her. The crime wave and the horrifying details sent chills down my spine and made the hair stand up on the back of my neck on more than one occasion. The rapist was smart, and planned his attack down to the smallest detail, having stalked the unsuspecting victims for a good while, knowing them intimately before making his move. Eventually, the crimes ceased, but no one knows exactly why. The author has her theories, and I would have to agree with her assessment. The disheartening thing here is the feeling that McNamara was closing in, making progress, despite the roadblocks, setbacks, and dead ends that comes with this type of investigation. As everyone knows, Michelle died before this book was completed, which adds yet another haunting layer to this book. Her passion seeps through the pages, along with her single- minded determination, that did border on obsession. I can see how that could happen, as this case was never solved and there is a sense of urgency about the book. The clock is ticking, and the feeling is one of being ‘so close, yet so far’, with time is running out for justice. Michelle's private life musings, added a more personal touch, something that might not always come off so well in the true crime arena, but I think the author was attempting to share with readers how her obsession and desire to see the case solved influenced and bled over into her personal life, taking up her every waking thought. It lends a poignancy, and occasionally a little humor, to the book that does offset the gruesome revelations unearthed about the crimes and the victims. One quick note about how the book was written, since it was published posthumously, and Michelle had not completed the book before her death. It is my understanding that her lead researchers pieced the book together using what Michelle had already written, along with her extensive notes. Unfortunately, the organization, and presentation, is not great. In true crime, disorganization is a huge pet peeve of mine and I would, under ordinary circumstances, have been more than a little exasperated and disappointed. In this case, I was a lot more forgiving, but I still think someone should have polished it up a little better. I would not let that deter you from reading this book, however, as, despite the bumpy ride, it is still quite an effective read. Unless you have nerves of steel, I don’t recommend reading this book alone at night, because it will certainly give you the heebie jeebies. But, I do hope the book generates enough attention that someone might come forward with new information or will pick up the torch and continue the search for the elusive ‘Golden State Killer’. 4 stars!121!oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best nonfiction 2018! what will happen?fulfilling book riot's 2018 read harder challenge task #2: A book of true crimeno extry points this time.there’s almost no point in my writing a content-based review of this book - i’m late to the party and better folks than me have already admirably and exhaustively covered both what the book is about and the unusual circumstances occurring beyond its covers - michelle mcnamara’s sudden death two years before the book’s publication, and the arrest of the golden state killer two months after it hit shelves. i’m not going to say much more than that this man was a monster (duh) and i’m glad he’s finally been caught and i hope he lives long enough to suffer profoundly for what he’s done. and, seemingly at odds with this unsavory part of me wishing bad things upon a bad person, that mcnamara’s writing is vivid and empathetic and even though i am not well-read in the true crime genre, she seems to bring something extra to the table, which is better-articulated in gillian flynn’s introduction:I love reading true crime, but I’ve always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else’s tragedy. So like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best: writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane. It was inevitable that I would find Michelle.I’ve always thought the least appreciated aspect of a great true-crime writer is humanity. Michelle McNamara had an uncanny ability to get into the minds of not just the killers but the cops who hunted them, the victims they destroyed, and the trail of grieving relatives left behind.she’s empathetic and observant throughout, and it’s so unfortunate that parts of this book had to be compiled and cobbled together from articles she published elsewhere or assorted notes, and (double, triple, quadruple duh) even more unfortunate that she never got to see it published, or to see the overwhelmingly positive response to it, or to see this man finally behind bars.i’m just going to share a few passages that struck me while i was reading this, and you can go out and read the book for yourself and find your own striking passages, because there will probably be more than a few. this one gave me chills and anger:He was brazen. Twice he entered homes, pressing on undeterred when he knew victims had spotted him and were frantically dialing the police. Children didn’t bother him. He never hurt them physically, but he would tie up the older ones and put them in another room. He put Jane’s toddler son on the bedroom floor during the attack. The boy fell asleep. When he awoke, he peered over the bed. The EAR had left. His mother lay bound in strips of torn towels and was gagged with a washcloth. He mistook the ligatures for bandages.“Is the doctor gone?” he whispered.this one made me feel awe and admiration: It was a little after four a.m. when the first officer entered the opened rear patio door, hesitantly making his way toward the woman calling out to him. She lay face down on her living room floor, naked, her wrists and ankles tied behind her with shoelaces. A ski-masked stranger had just spent an hour and a half terrorizing Fiona and her husband. He brutally raped her. Fiona was five two, 110 pounds - a wisp of a woman. She was also a native Sacramentan, in possession of a dry, matter-of-fact manner, a clear-eyed resilience that belied her petite size. “Well, I guess the East Area Rapist is the South Area Rapist now,” she said.and this long one made me really appreciate that empathetic, observant part of the author. people like her should really be consultants for writers and actors and employed as “perspective coaches,” if that is such a thing. it should be a thing. After spending enough hours with them, I’ve noticed a few things about detectives. They all smell vaguely of soap. I’ve never met a detective with greasy hair. They excel at eye contact and have enviable posture. Irony is never their go-to tone. Wordplay makes them uneasy. The good ones create long conversational vacuums that you reflexively fill, an interrogation strategy that proved to me through my own regrettable prattle how easily confessions can be elicited. They lack facial elasticity; or rather, they contain it. I’ve never met a detective who pulled a face. They don’t recoil or go wide-eyed. I’m a face maker. I married a comedian. Many of my friends are in show business. I’m constantly surrounded by big expressions, which is why I immediately noticed the lack of them in detectives. They maintain a pleasant but vigorous blankness that I admire. I’ve tried to imitate it, but I can’t. I came to recognize subtle but discernible shifts in the blankness - a narrowing of the eyes, a jaw squeeze, usually in response to hearing a theory they’ve long since eliminated. A veil comes down. But they’ll never tip their hand. They’ll never tell you, “We already looked into that angle ages ago.” Instead they’ll just absorb it and leave you with a polite “Huh.”In their reserve and in virtually every other way, detectives differ from show-biz folks. Detectives listen. They’re getting a read. Entertainers get a read only to gauge their influence on a room. Detectives deal in concrete tasks. I once spent an hour listening to an actress friend analyze a three-line text that hurt her feelings. Eventually I’ll see the cracks in a detective’s veneer, but in the beginning their company is an unexpected relief, like fleeing a moodily lit cast party loud with competitive chatter and joining a meeting of determined Eagle Scouts awaiting their next challenge. I wasn’t a native in the land of the literal-minded, but I enjoyed my time there.so, although you don’t need one more review from a stranger telling you that this book is worth reading, i have written one anyway. come to my blog!!121!FIVE STARSMy queen, Gillian Flynn, starts this book with a Midwestern twang and down-to-earth introduction; Patton Oswalt ends with a heart-rending final chapter and I was spellbound the entire time by Michelle McNamara's non-fiction novel.A mind-blowing mountain of evidence to sift through and present in one novel only slightly frightened Michelle McNamara. What truly frightened her and kept her awake at night was the fact that the Golden State Killer has gotten away with his 10 year reign of terror and is possibly blending into society as someone's husband or dad now.Yes, McNamara was obsessed with her search for the monster. If you read even a small item about this killer/rapist, I doubt you can remain content to leave it at that. It is impossibly frustrating in this day of DNA instant matching that the creep could still be walking the streets. She rightfully felt until the day she died that she was on the verge of identifying the killer, probably through an Ancestry.com like site. A true-crime blogger, McNamara knew she was obsessed with GSK and does not hold back the introspective criticism. She knows herself and she understands people on a level that most of us don't. The seasoned and weary criminalists on the case came to appreciate, even rely on her skills. She, in turn, relied heavily on crowd-sourcing and advanced technology to help in the relentless search.She writes impressively about the victims, the survivors and the detectives involved. She articulates the many (50) cases in bite-sized chunks and does not glorify nor hold back the details. It is a terrifying book, yet full of compassion and understanding for the victims. My mouth continually fell open and my head was shaking NO as I listened to this moving account from one woman with an enormous investigation to relate to the public. It is simply a magnificent piece of work. The audio narration is AMAZING, but I still ended up buying the Kindle version to look at the maps and other evidence she has pictured.If you are interested to check out a sample of the book, you can read her magazine article here. http://www.lamag.com/longform/in-the-...!121!5, well I'll be sleeping with a baseball bat forever now stars!!!🎶Everyday I'm feeling fine,Drinking wine,Forever reading true crime🎶This starts with an introduction by juggernaut thriller author Gillian Flynn and ends with a heartbreaking and beautiful epilogue by McNamara's husband and esteemed actor Patton Oswalt. What happens in-between was pure, unadulterated journalistic *magic*. “Writing this now, I’m struck by two incompatible truths that pain me. No one would have taken more joy from this book than my mother. And I probably wouldn’t have felt the freedom to write it until she was gone.”While on its surface, this is a story about an elusive burglar, rapist, and murderer dubbed the Golden State Killer - at its heart, it's really a look inside the life and mind of its author: Michelle McNamara. We're given intimate details about the crimes committed by GSK (whom we now know is Joseph DeAngelo) and are walked chronologically through the escalation and the atrocities he reaped upon the Sacramento area over a decade-long crime-spree. Spliced in between these horrendous retellings we're given insight into McNamara. Who she is as a person, where her obsessive nature comes from, how it was ultimately refined to true-crime. Her passion for the work she does is evident throughout the entirety of this read and it's impossible not to be swept up into the sheer magnitude of research and dedication she put into this masterpiece. “The victims recede from view. Their rhythm is off, their confidence drained. They’re laden with phobias and made tentative by memory. Divorce and drugs beset them. Statutes of limitations expire. Evidence kits are tossed for lack of room. What happened to them is buried, bright and unmoving, a coin at the bottom of a pool. They do their best to carry on.”What really struck me here was the accessibility of McNamara's voice. When you're dealing in such raw, gruesome and heart-rending facts it's easy to get lost in the sensationalism of it all. So much of true-crime is this in-your-face, all about ratings, how many jaws can we get to drop type of business that the humanity of those affected is lost. McNamara did not falter in this regard even once. She dealt in pure facts and maintained a clear and deep respect for the victims, the police officers, and the communities this criminal terrorized. ""I don’t care if I’m the one who captures him. I just want bracelets on his wrists and a cell door slamming behind him.”It is certainly very interesting having read this book after DeAngelo has now been caught and knowing how easy it would've been for him to just slip through the cracks and live the rest of his life a free man. I think it shows who McNamara was as a person that despite her deep obsession with this case she simply wanted him caught. She didn't need fame or fortune or to be involved -in the end, she just wanted justice. It leaves a sad aura around me knowing that she will not get to see the praise and reception she has received and that we've lost such a truly talented voice in investigative journalism. I completed this as a Traveling Friends read and it is incredible how many people have their own stories of seemingly normal people we later find out have committed heinous crimes. This makes a fantastic buddy read as there are endless opportunities to discuss. However, if I can give future readers one piece of advice: don't read this alone, at night or you'll be gone in the dark too. Cheers to Michelle McNamara and a true work of art.!121!Since its publication earlier this year, some have asked whether Michelle McNamara's utterly engrossing true crime book, 
I'll Be Gone in the Dark
, would be as popular if McNamara, the wife of comedian and actor Patton Oswalt, hadn't died suddenly while writing the book in 2016. While that tragedy certainly raised the book's profile, the fact is, this is a tremendously well-written and compelling book, worthy of every bit of acclaim it's gotten. It's just sad McNamara isn't around to appreciate the response to her years of hard work.""Violent men unknown to me have occupied my mind all my adult life—long before 2007, when I first learned of the offender I would eventually dub the Golden State Killer. The part of the brain reserved for sports statistics or dessert recipes or Shakespeare quotes is, for me, a gallery of harrowing aftermaths: a boy's BMX bike, its wheels still spinning, abandoned in a ditch along a country road; a tuft of microscopic green fibers collected from the small of a dead girl's back. To say I'd like to stop dwelling is beside the point.""Unsolved crimes—particularly murders—were an obsession of McNamara's from when she was 14 years old. Growing up the youngest of six children in Oak Park, Illinois, in the mid-1980s, a young woman from her neighborhood was murdered one night while jogging. Even though some boys she knew might very well have seen the murderer shortly after he committed his crime, the murder was never solved, and from that act of senseless violence, a fascination which turned into an obsession and a career was borne.""I was a hoarder of ominous and puzzling details. I developed a Pavlovian response to the word 'mystery.' My library record was a bibliography of the macabre and true. When I meet people and hear where they're from I orient them in my mind by the nearest unsolved crime.""McNamara created the true crime website TrueCrimeDiary.com, where she enjoyed rehashing unsolved cases with the police and others originally involved in them, as well as other armchair detectives. But nothing gripped her like the havoc wreaked by the man she dubbed the ""Golden State Killer,"" a man who terrorized Northern California for more than 10 years in the 1970s and 1980s, committing 50 sexual assaults and 10 brutal murders, before disappearing without ever being caught.In 
I'll Be Gone in the Dark
, McNamara laid out the grisly, disturbing trail this killer and rapist left behind. Buoyed by painstaking research, she provides stories about his victims and those who got away lucky, the dogged police officers and detectives tasked with hunting down this criminal mastermind. It's fascinating but frustrating, in that without the technology used today in solving crimes, without the kind of knowledge about serial killers and serial criminals that exists today, this criminal was able to escape.While that in and of itself makes for an interesting read, McNamara wasn't afraid to talk about herself as well, and how this obsession affected her life. Reading this book brought you closer to the mind of a fascinating woman, one who will never be able to tell her own story in greater detail, nor will she be able to see how people reacted to her book. She was a great writer, and her research and interpretation was top-notch. There was a reason that police detectives were willing to talk with her and rehash the crimes they couldn't solve—because they knew she got them.In his blurb for the book, Stephen King said it best: ""What readers need to know—what makes this book so special—is that it deals with two obsessions, one light and one dark. The Golden State Killer is the dark half; Michelle McNamara is the light half. It’s a journey into two minds, one sick and disordered, the other intelligent and determined. I loved this book."" Yep.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html.!121!UPDATE: An arrest has been made, 72 year old Joseph James DeAngelo a former police officer.This book is easily one of the best True Crimes books I have ever read. The first time I remember hearing about Michelle McNamara was on an episode of 48 Hours and the only reason I watched that episode was because I recognized her husband Patton Oswalt. His first name is my last name and for that reason I've always liked him. The 48 Hours episode was about his wife Michelle and her dogged pursuit of a prolific serial rapist/killer which she named The Golden State Killer. I had never heard of this killer but I was instantly intrigued. Unfortunately by time the episode aired Michelle had tragically passed away but what she left behind may one day lead to the capture of one of the most vile serial killers in history. I'll Be Gone In The Dark is part True Crime, part memoir and in my very very humble opinion it is a masterpiece. Michelle spent nearly a decade intricately researching and playing amateur detective trying to weave together 40 years of evidence in an herculean effort to discover the true identity of The Golden State killer. A killer who's crimes weren't even connected until the early 2000's. His were originally thought to be separate crimes. From 1976-1979 he was in parts of California known as The East Area Rapist. From 1974-1975 in parts of California he was known as The Ransaker, from 1979-1986 he was The Original Night Stalker. It took DNA to connect all the cases back to one offender. This book ends with a cliffhanger, we don't know who the killer is but we are much much closer. As I read this I wondered if the killer himself had read this book. After I finished I'll Be Gone In The Dark I felt sad that this wonderful woman isn't here to reap her rightful praise for this amazing piece work. I couldn't help but feel GSK had taken Michelle as his latest victim. I hope he's caught not just because of the vile crimes he's committed but as tribute to the life of Michelle McNamara.A Must Read! 2018 Around The Year In 52 Books: A book rated 5 Stars by at least 1 friend.2018 Popsugar Reading Challenge: True Crime.!121!This was my most highly anticipated book of 2018, and the first book I ever preordered. I didn't want to run the risk of a waiting list at my local library, and knew I would want to read it the second it was available. I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer by Michelle McNamara arrived on my doorstep February 27. Yesterday, March 8, I finally finished it. At 328 pages and in my favorite genre of true crime, I didn't initially suspect it would take me over a week to finish it, but...If you are reading this, you probably know the premise. The Golden State Killer, more commonly known as the East Area Rapist (EAR) or Original Night Stalker (ONS), or as EAR-ONS (I know, it's a mouthful), raped 50 people and murdered an additional 12 others in the 70s and 80s. McNamara was halfway through an exhaustive investigation of his crimes when she died, leaving her book unfinished. Thanks to her team of fellow investigators and editors, as well as her husband, her remaining notes were pieced together to finish and publish the book.McNamara's utter and complete devotion to her subject shines strongly throughout the book. The most interesting segments are personal anecdotes about her work and how she got investigators to open up to her. She was a talented writer and an exhaustive investigator; that much is clear. Unfortunately, McNamara's gifted writing is not enough to carry a book she did not end up completing herself. The sections that were pieced together by her editors from her other published works and from her notes are woefully clunky and disjointed compared to the text McNamara wrote herself. Another major issue I have with the book is the way the timeline of events is organized. The book starts with a few murders in the middle of the EAR-ONS' crime spree, then jumps to Hollywood in the late aughts, then back to the beginning of the EAR-ONS crime spree, then to the mid-90s investigations, then...you get the point. It's difficult--no, impossible--to piece together a linear narrative of the EAR-ONS' crimes, which to me is crucial for understanding how the investigation unfolded. I would be curious to know if this disjointed timeline, was the explicit choice of McNamara or a decision made after she died. It seems to be trying to complement the weaving in of personal anecdotes but in execution is just confusing.Part of this confusion is not McNamara's fault; with crimes spanning decades and dozens of victims and affected family members, and multiple investigations also spanning decades and many iterations of investigators, it's difficult to keep the facts straight. However, we are not even given every fact of the case. Although the EAR-ONS completed over 60 crimes, only a few are actually profiled in the book. This sparse exploration of individual instances of the EAR-ONS crimes, coupled with a timeline that jumps back and forth, makes it very difficult to follow along with the book's overall narrative structure. I was never able ""get into"" the narrative and had to work diligently to follow along. Unfortunately, I came away with little understanding of the case and its investigation, which is what made me want to pick up the book in the first place.My final issue with this book is that it presents no new information about the case, but in the media frenzy surrounding it is presented as if it does. I started the book under the impression that I would be reading McNamara's insight concerning the identity of the EAR-ONS, but that never happens. The best we are given are broad speculations about the location of his home and his possible occupation.  I won't count my expectations and prior knowledge of the case against this book, but I will say it is difficult to ignore the hype surrounding it. (Incidentally, if you are still interested in this case and want more information, the podcast Casefile has an excellent five-part series on the EAR-ONS) I wavered between a three-star and two-star review for this book. I initially had it as a three-star, but if I'm being honest with myself it's because I wanted to like it SO MUCH. I appreciate the effort McNamara put into her investigation, and the dedication her editors and husband must have had to see it published. I also love McNamara's writing style and wish I could read more by her. However, at the end of the day, this book is a confusing take on a prolific serial killer whose level of detail doesn't quite do justice to McNamara's investigation skills.!121!4.5 captivating and incredibly creepy. One would have had to have been in a news blackout, at least here in the states, to have not heard about the long overdue capture of the rapist and murderer, called the Golden State killer. This book is do well researched, an in-depth expose of all the incidents, the evidence collected and the many areas in California where this killer roamed. It was presented in a clear, concise and very interesting way. Yes, there is repetition, but it would be hard not eliminate that, as Michelle talks to many different law enforcement personnel as well as others, going over what she found, what they found, and what do far had been concluded. That for so long he was able to go without capture, it both unbelievable but yet understandable. There were no data base sharing information, nor was there dna profiling back then.I chose to listen to this and the narrator was outstanding. In fact I believe listening to this increased the creep factor quite a bit. You see, the rapist/killer whispered to his victims and the narrators whispering and thd rords spoken were chilling. Actually went to bed with bear spray on my nightstand. Years ago I was a true crime fanatic, read Helter skelter, all of Ann Rules many crime exposes, but this is the first one I have read for s long time. It was part of a sisters read and it helped, talking to oyhers, able to share our thoughts.It is terrible that after sll her work, Michelle died, way to young, before she saw this book published, nor the man who had been here obsession so long captured. Her husband narrates the end of the sufio, talking abbout his wife, and her work.!121!There is nothing more I would like to do then leave my pre-review of this as a full review, but my review has caused much confusion, so I cannot.Here is a longer, hopefully less discombobulating version:1) This is a gripping and well-written account of a then-unsolved serial killer case, and one brilliant woman's fixation with it.2) This book is very sad to me, for two reasons:a) Michelle McNamara died suddenly in her sleep, very young, and only months before the case she dedicated her life to would be solved. Many people yelled at me in the comments to tag this as a spoiler, which I won't do, because that's dumb. This is nonfiction. The author is not a character who dies. It's addressed in the synopsis, in the marketing, and in real life everywhere because it really truly happened.The ending of this book, which addresses her untimely passing, is beautiful and so sad.b) This was a fairly perfect true crime read for me until one point, toward the end, when McNamara bemoans the refusal of DNA testing companies to work with police departments. This is illegal, an infringement on privacy, and a gross thing to even consider. So that sucked. (Hopefully there is no confusion on what my stance on this idea is, but to clear things up if there is: NO. NONONONONONO. NO. DO NOT. NEVER. EVER. NO.)That's about it.Bottom line: We have all been deprived of a brilliant career from a brilliant woman, and this book is a sad and excellent reminder of that.-----------pre-reviewreasons this book made me very sad:1) i decided i love michelle mcnamara just in time for the very sad ending of the book, where her very sad and untimely passing is addressed (note: this is not a spoiler, it's an actual thing that happened in real life);2) and i thought this was a fairly perfect true crime story until suddenly, at the end, the as-of-right-now reticence of DNA companies to illegally cooperate with police was treated as a bad thing. uh...what?but full review to come / 4 stars anyway-----------tbr reviewmy ideal story will always be a true crime mystery that has gone unsolved for decades and is neatly tied up for good at the end.i am very excited.!121!So good. So scary. So tragic. So detailed. So chilling. So sad. SO GOOD.Reread: November 2022!121!“What readers need to know—what makes this book so special—is that it deals with two obsessions, one light and one dark. The Golden State Killer is the dark half; Michelle McNamara’s is the light half. It’s a journey into two minds, one sick and disordered, the other intelligent and determined. I loved this book.” -Stephen KingHad Michelle McNamara lived, I think she would have been proud of how well this book has been received, but I think she would have been even more moved to see that the man, Joseph James DeAngelo, she named ""The Golden State killer"" has been arrested and being charged for his heinous crimes. I imagine her sitting there in the court room, looking him straight in the eye, knowing justice will be served and the killer she was obsessed with finding had been caught.Michelle McNamara was a true crime journalist who started the website TrueCrimeDiary.com. She was determined to find ""The Golden State Killer"". A man who committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before he moved south where he murdered ten people. Michelle interviewed various detectives working diligently to solve the crimes, she read police reports, interviewed victims and their family members, she devoted countless hours to research, traveling to various locations, collecting box after box of reports. She educated herself on various forensic devices used to track and identify killers.Through her writing, she showed not only her humanity but the humanity of the victims and the police officers investigating the cases. She shared bits and pieces of herself with the reader. She shared what drove her desire to hunt this killer, she showed us glimpses into her private life and her relationships with those close to her. She poured her heart and soul into her research. She was intelligent, determined, and never gave us her quest for the truth. Her devotion is admirable and earned her the respect of the men and women in law enforcement who were also trying to capture this killer.""Her prose jumps off the page and sits down next to you..."" This book was completed after her death and various sections of the book inform the reader of what chapters were finished using Michelle's notes. This true crime book is nothing short of a masterpiece. There is a lot of information in this book. There are also maps and pictures of some of the victims. This is a very comprehensive book but also one that is very readable. Highly recommend!Read more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com!121!I was very wary of reading this book, because it just sounded so, so creepy and when I bought it, the killer had not yet been caught. Yet when he was recently found, after so many years, I felt compelled to know the background and read the book. It is a tragic story, made all the more so because its passionate, persistent author did not live to see this man's arrest, something she so badly wished for. This story is so disturbing, I could not get it out of my head and I could definitely not read it at night. All the same, I found it difficult to put down. The style of writing is so compelling, not dry like much non-fiction seems to me. McNamara's voice is unique, and she infected my with her deep interest and devotion to solving the case. I also liked how she gave the victims their own story and a considerable amount of attention, highlighting who they were before they were assaulted or killed by this evil man. This was a rough intro to true crime fiction for me, but worth the read. The writing is excellent and the fact that the killer has actually been caught feels like a stunning ending to this horrible story. It will take some time for me to stop thinking about this book and its author, and I think that is probably how it should be. Definitely recommended, but proceed with caution. This book will keep you awake at night.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com!121!I've been waiting for this book for a long time, having been a fan of McNamara's True Crime Diary blog (http://www.truecrimediary.com). While she hadn't finished it before her death, it is a remarkable book--both in terms of its investigative power and its superb, precise prose (and an excellent intro by Gillian Flynn and a poignant afterword by Patton Oswalt). But what makes it so special is how it becomes this living testament to the drive, strength and power of its author, a portrait of how her ample mind operated, and how her heart interpreted. And for all of us who loved true crime from a similarly young age and for whom the fascination has never left, it feels like a lovesong from a fellow pilgrim.Don't miss it.!121!“One day soon, you’ll hear a car pull up to your curb, an engine cut out. You’ll hear footsteps coming up your front walk. Like they did for Edward Wayne Edwards, twenty-nine years after he killed Timothy Hack and Kelly Drew, in Sullivan, Wisconsin. Like they did for Kenneth Lee Hicks, thirty years after he killed Lori Billingsley, in Aloha, Oregon.The doorbell rings.No side gates are left open. You’re long past leaping over a fence. Take one of your hyper, gulping breaths. Clench your teeth. Inch timidly toward the insistent bell.This is how it ends for you.“You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark,” you threatened a victim once.Open the door. Show us your face.Walk into the light.”-	Michelle McNamara, I’ll Be Gone in the DarkThe story behind this story is both sad and fascinating. Michelle McNamara was a renowned true crime writer who ran a popular blog dedicated to cold cases. One of her main targets was a man she dubbed the Golden State Killer, a serial rapist who dabbled in murder. His tally includes at least ten deaths, and more than fifty sexual assaults. She was in the process of writing a book on the GSK, whose crimes remained unsolved, when she died quite suddenly in 2016. The unfinished manuscript was published posthumously as I’ll Be Gone in the Dark in February 2018, some two years after McNamara’s death. It was an incomplete book about an incomplete investigation. But there was one more twist in store: about two months after publication, they caught the guy. With a back-story like that, it’s hard to judge I’ll Be Gone in the Dark. This is a book, after all, that lacks two endings: one written, the other substantive. This is the skeleton of a masterpiece, and had it been finished, might have become a classic. As it is, it is still very good, and demonstrates, as Capote did with In Cold Blood, that the true crime genre does not have to limit itself to the traditional murder mystery format.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark is not structured chronologically. Certainly, it is not written as a prosecutor’s brief, systematically tracking the killer, marshaling evidence, and zeroing in on a suspect. Instead, McNamara (and I’m assuming this is what she intended) moves back and forth in time. Parts of this are biographical, discussing her relationship with her mother, and examining her own obsession with crimes and criminals. Parts of this are historical, describing the Golden State Killer’s crimes in chilling fashion. And part of this is about the thrill of the chase, and the efforts McNamara undertook to try to find the man who terrorized swaths of California in the 70s and 80s. McNamara is an incredibly powerful writer. She takes care with her prose. As you can see from the opening quote, she knows how to grab you by the lapels and demand your attention. Her reconstructions of the GSK’s numerous break-ins are very good; she describes them in powerful and precise detail that never feels prurient. She is impressively incisive and observant, not just about the unidentified killer, but about the dogged detectives she meets along her journey. Her descriptions of where the crimes took place, and the way she evokes the various targeted neighborhoods, is excellent. And she can turn a phrase or two, describing things in a lively way: Most violent criminals smash through life like human sledgehammers. They have fists for hands and can’t plan beyond their sightlines. They’re caught easily. They talk too much. They return to the scene of the crime, as conspicuous as tin cans on a bumper. But every so often a blue moon surfaces. A snow leopard slinks by. I appreciated the book’s structure, especially since McNamara’s literary skill makes even the potentially-banal interesting. However, in moving back and forth as she does, the reader is required to pay close attention in order not to get lost. This issue is compounded by the fact that the Golden State Killer had as many names as a character in a Russian novel (East Area Rapist, East Area Rapist-Original Nightstalker, the Ransacker, etc.), and the book does not refer to him in any consistent way. I truly believe, had McNamara finished this as she planned, this might have been an all-timer, a genre transcending work. Life, however, is cruel to our plans and projects. The fact is, this was not finished, and though that is not necessarily fatal (one of my favorite books, Young Men and Fire, is also a posthumous release), the downsides are evident. There are certain chapters cobbled together from her previous writings, some of them already published. Thus, if you’ve read McNamara before, you might come across stuff that seems awfully familiar. And of course, the end is quite abrupt, a line that ends midsentence. Some of the people that McNamara worked with do their best to provide an epilogue. All this really does, however, is demonstrate once again how good McNamara wrote. More than that, this end-section, written by Paul Haynes and Billy Jensen, advances some extremely troubling views vis-à-vis the trashing of civil liberties in pursuit of a single criminal suspect. I like to think that McNamara would have thought a little deeper about this subject. (Just a brief aside: obsessives often lose perspective. McNamara was smart enough to recognize this within herself. Accordingly, it is worth noting, because this book does not, that while this is true crime, it is not typical crime. The most pressing criminal justice issues facing our society do not come from the lone, clever, Hollywood-esque serial killer with the dark quips and the furiously studied modus operandi. Rather, it comes from concentrated poverty, depressed mobility, and communities awash in guns and drugs. It comes from overcrowded prisons, unfair sentencing laws, and neighborhoods that do not trust law enforcement. So, while I definitely recommend I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, it is also worth making time for a book like Ghettoside or The Corner). By this point, most people know that a suspect has been arrested for these crimes. Unfortunately, this happened well after McNamara passed away, meaning that I’ll Be Gone in the Dark does not cover this ultimate surprise ending.That does not matter. In short: no killer, no problem. The best true crime understands that while the pursuit of justice motivates the hunt, it will not make things whole. Catching the alleged Golden State Killer (a 72 year-old man) may be cathartic, but it does not sew up the tears in heaven. It will not bring back the dead, un-traumatize the traumatized, or even prevent another crime. The search itself, though, is revealing about human nature. It speaks to a driving need to understand the incomprehensible, and to seek a cosmic balance in a universe that does not care.!121!5 frightening and fascinating true crime stars!Jaw dropping. Unsettling. Disturbing. Haunting. Devastating. These are just a few more of the words I would use to describe this unforgettable book and serial killer case.Never have I been so completely terrified yet addicted to a book! True crime is a genre I find myself becoming more and more interested in. This book was written so extremely well! It didn’t feel bogged down by facts and dates. I was quite literally hanging on every single word of this horrific story.The author, Michelle McNamara, was a true crime researcher and journalist whose career largely focused on hunting down the Golden State Killer. McNamara gave the “Golden State Killer” this name after piecing together that he was the same perpetrator of several rape and murder cases that weren’t originally linked. She spent years dedicated to tracking this serial rapist and killer down through extensive online research, interviews and revisiting crime scenes. She became a well known and respected resource for police detectives who were haunted by this case for decades. The Golden State Killer was responsible for 50 rapes and 10 murders in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Sadly, Michelle McNamara passed away before this book was published and before the world discovered the real name behind this masked man.The writing was excellent! I was completely consumed. I had no knowledge of this sickening serial killer and found myself in a constant state of shock while discovering all that he got away with FOR DECADES before being caught. I was equally terrified and fascinated by the words I was reading. The book kept me on edge from start to finish.I found myself in awe of McNamara when I began to truly understand her dedication and determination in solving this decades old cold case. The constant ups and downs she faced throughout her meticulous research was a roller coaster of emotions for her. Just when she thought she was on the right path, a road block would send her right back to the start, and yet she never gave up.It goes without saying that this is an extremely tough read. There are countless gruesome and highly uncomfortable details presented but all are necessary in order to present all the facts to the reader. Overall, this was a compulsively readable, well written account of one of history’s worst villains. Though I may be sleeping with my light on for a while longer, I’ll definitely be adding this to my 2022 Favourites shelf!Thank you to my lovely local library for the loan!!121!Reviews of this book were terrific from the get go - once available for readers....yet, my husband said....”don’t do it”. “Why do you need to read a book about a killer/serial rapist who committed crimes in the area where you lived as a young single female in the 70’s and 80’?” “Wasn’t it frightening enough - for real- back then? Oh yes, it was! So.... I stayed away from this book - until a friend gave me the hardcopy back in May of this year. I still didn’t read it right away as you can see....given it’s now the last day of August. The Audiobook- read by Gabra Zackmara, being ‘readily’ available- with a touch of one finger was too tempting. No waitlist. I downloaded it. The waitlist must have come & gone by now. I’m guessing there was a long waitlist in the beginning. But my library ordered 20 copies - anticipating the popularity. “Cherry”, by Nico Walker, might be the new ‘it’ popular book — ( which I haven’t read), leaving the doorway open for old news of “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark”. Not sure I have much more to add to the already thousands of reviews before me. The writing WAS outstanding - as readers have said - and learning about the author - Michelle McNamara’s and her family were things I didn’t know anything about - other than she died in her sleep before finishing this book. I LIKED THE AUDIOBOOK.....( I also read parts of my physical book - chapters where I felt I wanted to re-read sections for better understanding-and see the photos) ....but it was the Audiobook that I devoted long hours of listening. The voice narrator was perfect. The research - and years of dedication- of Michelle’s fans on her crime blog HAD to be a huge contributing factor in the arrest of Joseph DeAngelo. He’s everything but ‘Golden’. ......but Michelle McNamara was!!!!121!""This is how it ends for you. ""You'll be silent forever, and I'll be gone in the dark,"" you threatened a victim once. Open the door. Show us your face. Walk into the light.""A portrait of a woman's obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. I'll Be Gone in the Dark is the masterpiece that Michelle McNamara was working on when she tragically passed away in 2016. It's a chilling account of a criminal mastermind, The Golden State Killer, and the wreckage he left behind.This was one of those surreal reading experiences that I'll never forget. I had been dying to get to this one, I needed a true crime fix, and so I decided on to start it on the Saturday. I was about halfway through when I woke up to the news on the following Wednesday that they had captured the suspected Golden State Killer. Cue obsessive scrolling through twitter all day and waiting impatiently for the news conference that evening. Prior to his capture, I felt intense disgust, rage and frustration that this man was still potentially walking the streets (Michelle was convinced he wasn't in jail or dead). As I read through the timeline of his crimes and ways in which he tortured and terrified his victims, I had a few restless nights.Coming into contact with someone like him is my worst nightmare. Home is where you're supposed to feel safe. He often tracked and watched his victims prior to attacking, working out their schedules and how he could discretely get inside the house to carry out his intention of rape and/or murder. You'd be woken up by a flashlight shining in your face in the middle of the night and subsequently tied up so that he could do what he wanted with you. What made it even more terrifying for me was that he wasn't put off by the presence of a male partner. He would just force the female to tie her partner up before dealing with the female himself. He would often balance plates or similar items on the partner's back so that he would hear if the husband dared move while he raped his wife. So, yeah, I guess I was pretty disturbed.To then hear that this personification of evil had potentially been identified and arrested completely changed the reading experience for me. I mean, I was still appalled at what I was reading, but at least I could feel some happiness in that he would be brought to justice for what he done to so many people and their families. But I am honestly tired of talking about this serial rapist and murderer. The real takeaway from this book is the character of Michelle McNamara. Her determination, her courage, her spirit, her tenacity, her humanity - I could list all of her admirable traits until I am blue in the face. She brought true crime writing to another level and I am truly devastated that we will never get another true crime novel from her, she really would have changed the entire game.I know the investigative team have yet to attribute any of the credit of his identification and capture to McNamara's work, but if you've read the book and if you have any semblance of the spotlight that she focused on this lesser-known serial rapist/murderer, then you know that is bullshit. She kept the story alive and brought an urgency to solving the case. Michelle knew the answer lay within those online genetic profiles on genealogical sites and that is ultimately how he was identified.I loved this book, it was chilling and terrifying, but there was a light within it, and that light was Michelle. Even if you're a not a true crime fan, I would highly recommend this book. It's heartbreaking, yet inspiring and I only wish Michelle had been here to see the bastard finally go down.!121!""You'll be silent forever, and I'll be gone in the dark.""In this book McNamara gives an unflinching account of the Golden State Killer, the mysterious boogeyman who burgled, raped and murdered his way through California. This book was divided into three parts; Book 1, details of the crimes and the victims: Book 2, details of the investigators (from forensic scientists, detectives, criminologists and witnesses) and the investigation: Book 3, covers further profiling such as geographic (this part was written by McNamara's researchers after she had died). This book also included an amazing introduction by Gillian Flynn and such a thoughtful and heartfelt afterword by Patten Oswald, Michelle McNamara's husband.This true crime book was fantastic! Probably one of the best I have ever read, and one I've been recommending to everyone. This book is informational without being boring. McNamara does a brilliant job at humanising the case and respecting both the victims, their families and the towns shook by terror. She gives names of the police and victims, and describes and paints their personality onto paper so that you can imagine their ordeal and the frightening encounters they have had to endure. Another good thing about the book is that this is entirely comprehensive- especially to a lay person. McNamara does a great job at explaining the technological aspects of the case and DNA profiling, without going into too much scientific detail, but provides you with the basics of how it works. She shows how this helped the case progress, linking crimes to so many different areas over California. One of the chapters that had me completely gripped was called ""The One"", this explored how there were certain suspects that linked up to so many of the crimes... but the DNA didn't match, and McNamara details the disappointment from investigators after pouring their energy into catching this offender.It was also helpful how McNamara incorporated the map of California in the first few pages, with notes on the side following most of the crimes. As someone who does not know much about the geography of California, this really helped me form an understanding of the geographical timeline of the rapes and murders and how they all linked up.As someone who didn't know anything about these crimes, it was fascinating to learn more about the investigation into this mysterious, awful murderer. I found this book completely fascinating, and as someone who has read a lot of true crime and studied forensic psychology, I really enjoyed it!I think McNamara does a brilliant job at describing her own obsession with the case and the lengths that people go to when researching, whether this be officer's on the case officially or people at home interested in the case. I liked learning about geographical profiling and learning of all the different theories purported by researcher's and investigator's alike (for example, the killer using a plane).While I loved this book, I really wish that Michelle McNamara was alive today to see how greatly received her work has been and how it has sparked a new generation of investigators into crime. I would've loved to have seen her witness the case unfold and the catching of the killer. I agree with Gillian Flynn in that I think Michelle McNamara would've been a great person to know and be friends with, as I myself have delved into the obsession of understanding a criminal's mind, and it would've been great to discuss and hear more from her. This book was completely engrossing and intriguing and really got the heart pumping. I was addicted to learning about the Golden State Killer and the surrounding investigation.McNamara has a special ability in her writing by drawing you into the investigation and ensnares you, so that you too become a detective yourself, formulating your own theories and putting pieces of the puzzle together. I feel like I need to read this again in the future just to absorb and uncover more details!","['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Memoir', 'History']"
A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail (Mass Market Paperback),Bill Bryson,4.06,408090,1998,"The Appalachian Trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America—majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you’re going to take a hike, it’s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you’ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way—and a couple of bears. Already a classic, A Walk in the Woods  will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).","It's been a busy couple of weeks, so I thought I'd spent the last of my holiday indulging in a witty travelogue to set my feet itching. Unfortunately, I picked the wrong book. Years of declining the advice of the Bryson-worshipers, it seems, was not in vain.I'm halfway through, and - like the author on the daunting trail - am unsure as to whether or not I can finish my task. Bryson sounds, to put it mildly, a real jerk. He's smug and superior, and spends most of the book complaining about his companions on the trail. A common motif is how everyone one is but a weekend hiker, that he is a true back-to-nature type in comparison. True, some of his encounters sound less than thrilling, but even the obnoxious woman he encounters should get credit for tackling the trail by herself. Instead, she's unceremoniously ditched (in real life as well as print) by the man who couldn't stomach the thought of going alone. He enlists the companionship of a long-lost friend with whom he'd proven incompatible on a previous travel experience. Said ""friend"" is then derided throughout the book for his sloth, roughness in manner, and lowbrow tastes. Meanwhile, Bryson paints himself as Guardian of the Trail, criticising the Parks Service along with all who venture through her woods.I'm still waiting for even a glimpse of the much-vaunted Bryson wit and charm to show itself. At the moment, he's nothing more than the stereotypical Blue Stater - putting himself on a pedestal while looking down his nose at everyone else. It's not attractive, and it makes for a very frustrating read. I wish he'd stayed home.!121!I am a huge fan of hiking. My friends and I, several times a year, will take trips out to random State and National Parks. We spend a great deal of time out in the woods and any sort of nature. It is not only enjoyable and relaxing but good to stay in shape. But then again my friends and I are all people who are very comfortable n the woods, due to our military backgrounds.Then there are these two. *sigh* Is the book funny? Yes...that humor and the interesting history about the Appalachian Trail is the only reason I finished this book. Why? To hear two fat fools tromping through the Appalachians is borderline annoying. Seriously? Are civilians usually so fucking stupid? (Don't answer that. It's rhetorical. I've been watching civilians since 2008 and I already know the answer). This is a laundry list of what NOT to do, what NOT to eat and what NOT to drink. I was aghast at the stuff these two were munching on and the amount of soda pop they drink. Stupid assholes don't realize soda dehydrates you...but hey, it's more common than you think. As an example of real life stupidity, there is an awesome State Park in Utah called Great Salt Lake park. It's ummmm a salt lake...which means it's a rather extreme environment. Now a quick Google search will show you DOZENS on incidents of idiots wandering around this place with little to no hydration and getting in trouble or even dying. Does this surprise you? Then you have a much higher level of respect for the survivability of the average civilian. It doesn't surprise me in the slightest and books like this merely reinforce what an instructor of mine at Scout-Sniper school said ""Don't ever mistake it-but civilian types have a field survivability rate comparable to infants""So please, don't do any of the things in this book. If you wish to hike the Appalachian Trail..ask yourself: How often do you walk? Have you ever just put on steel toed boots, stuffed a backpack with say 45-60 lbs of books and then went on a nice 5 or six mile hike? Go for it. Do it on flat ground. If at the end of it..you have barely a sheen of sweat and are like ""ok what's next?"" then you are fine. However if this sounds ""rough"" ummmmmmm...yeah..take a car, stay at hotels and realize watching Animal Planet or National Geographic has not prepared your body for real nature with no one nearby to come save you.Now that my polemic is over- funny book. Nothing great. Some decent history about the trail...and that's really it. I didn't care for the two fat asses. I read this book because I enjoy nature and spend a lot of time in it. But there was no need for me to really read this book...you may enjoy it as a funny travelogue, but that's all it is.!121!I am what some might call a pussy hiker. I do genuinely enjoy a leisurely stroll in the “mountains” of Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. I like the pretty views. I always bring my conveniently-sized L.L. Bean backpack ($39.95 from the Kittery Outlets) so I have a place for my camera and cell phone. But by early afternoon, I would like to be done, please. I would like to be done and sitting at a booth in a pub with my burger and beer. Camping is certainly worthy of consideration, but here’s the deal: I don’t do rain. In light of the fact that weather reports are unreliable beyond a 48-hour window (and even that is pushing it in New England), it is unlikely I would ever camp for more than a two-night stay. Oh, and if I were to camp, I would like it to be at a site that has free Wi-Fi.What this amounts to is that the Appalachian Trail, endearingly referred to by those hiking it as “the AT,” will never be anything more to me than a lovely little map.
(click to enlarge)
BUT. I am glad for gung-ho people like Bryson and his chubby checker friend Katz who did walk “the AT” and are kind enough to let me know what I am missing. As it turns out, I am not missing much. This is not to downplay the extraordinarity of a 2,200-mile trail of wilderness running from Georgia to Maine, a trail that takes the average thru-hiker six months to complete, but in terms of day-to-day variation, it is basically a shitload of trees followed by another shitload of trees.

For me, this book makes a better argument for the day hike. There are many parts of the trail I would enjoy, including the Smoky Mountains, the Shenandoah Valley, and the Delaware Water Gap. Like Bryson, though, I am a people person, and I enjoy my simple human comforts. I would like to see these areas without having to make an extended departure from civilization. Why can’t I have both—my nature and my nurture? Fortunately for me, almost a full third of the Appalachian Trail is in New England, so maybe I can have it all—because I think if there is one thing I’ve learned from Bryson’s experience, it is that I don’t have to suffer through long days of cold rain and hungry nights to enjoy what the Appalachian Trail has to offer.!121!I kind of surprised I liked this book at all, because: a) I read pathetically little non-fiction b) I've never read a travelogue ANDc) I'm only a fan of the Great Outdoors as long as I'm safely Indoors.So, color me shocked that I not only finished this, but giggled my way through quite a bit of it! Bryson really is a pretty funny writer, and the way he captured his experience on the Appalachian Trail had me in tears a few times. His fears about getting mauled by a bear (among other things) before he started off were especially hysterical, and maybe that's because I could see a lot of myself in his initial terror of spending so much time surrounded by...NATURE!Now, there was a decent-sized chunk towards the middle of the book that I just had to grit my teeth and push on through. Bryson's friend Katz wasn't with him during this portion, and the difference in the tone of the writing is really noticeable. Lots and lots and lots of mind-numbing details about the Trail, and very little of his experiences. And while all of that sort of info is relevant to the book, it's also the main reason that I don't actively seek out non-fiction or travelogues. Eventually, Katz comes back to finish out the hike, and the story vastly improves, but it never managed to recapture the humor or spirit that it had in the beginning. But that's only MY opinion.And I really did enjoy the last bits of the book a lot. Especially the moments between Katz & Bryson there towards the end.Overall, I'd say this was a winner. And even if the whole thing wasn't to my liking, the first half was an easy 5 star read for me.In fact, it made me want to call up my BFF to see if she wanted to take the kids camping this summer so we could poop near a waterfall!You know, instead of meeting at a hotel on the beach and drinking ourselves silly while the kids play in the surf.And then I thought about that sentence.Bwahahahahahahaha!No. Just...no.See you in Florida, Jill! I'll bring the blender!!121!I wanted to like Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. Not sure what I was expecting from this—perhaps more about hiking on the actual AT and the reasons Bryson made this trek—but I was mostly disappointed. It read like a series of travel brochures: here’s the history of the region on this section of the trail, and now another…There was much more attention devoted to towns along the route than hiking the actual trail. It was also disappointing that Bryson noted the historical stereotypes of Appalachian people and casually confirmed their stupidity without any real interaction (not once but many times). The smugness of his remarks was irritating. I still would like to hike the AT, but Bryson did little to illuminate what it’s really like to hike the trail except to offer that it’s not what most people expect.!121!I'm no city mouse. I'm a country mouse who lives in jeans and who often has a thick layer of soil under her nails from gardening. But, when compared to my brother, I feel like Beyoncé.My brother is like. . . Inman, from Cold Mountain. A man who walks and walks, all over Appalachia.He knows how to forage for food and how to identify what is good and what is bad, out in nature. I can point to anything within the plant kingdom, and he knows its name. He composts all of his own waste and leaves a very faint footprint on our planet.He's also. . . you know, a little crazy, when it comes to the whole walking thing.My brother has thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail once, in its entirety, and has section-hiked more than 900+ miles of favorite parts of it, at other times. He walks or hikes 5-25 miles a day, and he's currently on the Pacific Crest Trail, somewhere in Northern California, at the time of this writing.He's a walker, and even though I ALSO walk and hike, my habits apparently look like small potatoes to him. When he was here in May, at our house, preparing to head out to hike the PCT, he was nudging me, emphatically, to hike the Appalachian Trail soon.He was doing this nudging as all three of my kids were in the kitchen with me, and one of them was literally hanging on to my leg. Both dogs were starving, staring at me as we talked, our cats were walking in and out of the house, yowling for food, and my husband was outside, pulling weeds.I must have looked at him like he was an idiot. I sputtered out something in annoyance, like, “I have responsibilities. Maybe someday, like, when we're retired??” (And, maybe not then, either?)The compromise we reached was that, instead of starting the AT on that day, I would commit to reading Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods while he was out on the PCT. Fair enough. I finished it today.Here's what I have to say:I love Bill Bryson when he's funny, like when he's making social observations, or, in the case of this story, out hiking with his friend, Stephen Katz, and the hilarious commentary that ensues.I don't love Bill Bryson when he bores me to bits, breaking off from the funny story to describe geological phenomenons or maps or the National Park system in the United States. Be humorous OR be didactic, Bill, but please don't be both. I would never hike one of these trails without an entourage, bear spray, a billy club and/or a baseball bat and an INCREDIBLE SENSE OF HUMOR.After reading Bryson's book, I would like to hike at least part of the Appalachian Trail someday, if only to write about it. I believe that my desire to pepper spray any strange looking man on the trail, without a moment's hesitation, may make for some interesting writing. Plus, I'd be sure to scream at every snake, and I'd probably be stupid enough to play with a bear cub. They're so cute!Personally, I wanted to know a LOT more about these freaks in the shelter at night, and way more details on where and how they all went to the bathroom (shudder), and I felt completely let-down that Bryson and his companion hiked so little of the actual trail.Honestly, the book was so boring in the middle (when they gave up on the trail the first time), that I could barely summon the interest to read it again.I think I need to stop thinking of Bryson as a humorist, like Dave Barry. He does make me laugh, but he does drone on, too, about things that interest me not. I've reached a weird point with him, where I'm not sure I want to continue reading more.Four stars for some memorable descriptions of a few of the hikers and several hearty laughs. . . And fingers crossed for the safe return home of my brother!!121!Bill Bryson calls the Appalachian Trail ""the grandaddy of long hikes,"" but for me, this book is the granddaddy of hiking memoirs. I first read it sometime around 1999, and I enjoyed it so much that not only have I reread this multiple times, but it also inspired me to read at least a dozen other hiking adventures. None have matched Bryson's wit. Before he started writing long books on various aspects of history, Bryson was known for his entertaining travelogues. A Walk in the Woods was his humorous take on attempting a long-distance hike of the Appalachian Trail, which spans more than 2,100 miles from Georgia to Maine. Here were his reasons for trying:""It would get me fit after years of waddlesome sloth. It would be an interesting and reflective way to reacquaint myself with the scale and beauty of my native land after nearly twenty years of living abroad. It would be useful (I wasn't quite sure in what way, but I was sure nonetheless) to learn to fend for myself in the wilderness. When guys in camouflage pants and hunting hats sat around in the Four Aces Diner talking about fearsome things done out-of-doors, I would no longer have to feel like such a cupcake. I wanted a little of that swagger that comes with being able to gaze at a far horizon through eyes of chipped granite and say with a slow, manly sniff, 'Yeah, I've shit in the woods.'""And so Bryson plans his trip, gets indignant over the high cost of outdoor equipment, and recruits an old friend, Stephen Katz, to walk the trail with him. Katz, an overweight, out-of-shape, recovering alcoholic, adds much hilarity to the adventure. The first day on the trail, Katz falls behind and has a fit, throwing away a lot of supplies in an effort to lighten the load of his pack. Later he gets lost during a stretch when they were dangerously low on water. But he's so pathetic and funny that you forgive him.Meanwhile, Bryson was having his own problems that first day:""It was hell. First days on hiking trips always are. I was hopelessly out of shape -- hopelessly. The pack weighed way too much. Way too much. I had never encountered anything so hard, for which I was so ill prepared. Every step was a struggle. The hardest part was coming to terms with the constant dispiriting discovery that there is always more hill ... The elusive summit continually retreats by whatever distance you press forward, so that each time the canopy parts enough to give a view you are dismayed to see that the topmost trees are as remote, as unattainable, as before. Still you stagger on. What else can you do?""After a few days on the trail, they met another hiker named Mary Ellen, who leeched onto them. ""She was from Florida, and she was, as Katz forever after termed her in a special tone of awe, a piece of work. She talked nonstop, except when she was clearing out her eustachian tubes (which she did frequently) by pinching her nose and blowing out with a series of violent and alarming snorts of a sort that would make a dog leave the sofa and get under a table in the next room. I have long known that it is part of God's plan for me to spend a little time with each of the most stupid people on earth, and Mary Ellen was proof that even in the Appalachian woods I would not be spared.""I'm not going to retype entire pages, but trust me that the conversations with Mary Ellen are one of the highlights of this book. Bryson and Katz spend several weeks on the trail, hiking 500 miles in their first section. Then the two take a break and return home for a few weeks, and Bryson resumes with some shorter hikes in New England. Katz and Bryson reunite in Maine to hike a particularly daunting section of the trail called the Hundred Mile Wilderness:""The Appalachian Trail is the hardest thing I have ever done, and the Maine portion was the hardest part of the Appalachian Trail, and by a factor I couldn't begin to compute.""Exhausted, filthy and hungry, the two abandon their trek in Maine and hitchhike to a small town, where they're able to make their way home again. ""I have regrets, of course. I regret that I didn't do [Mount] Katahdin (though I will, I promise you, I will). I regret that I never saw a bear or wolf or followed the padding retreat of a giant hellbender salamander, never shooed away a bobcat or sidestepped a rattlesnake, never flushed a startled boar. I wish that just once I had truly stared death in the face (briefly, with a written assurance of survival). But I got a great deal else from the experience. I learned to pitch a tent and sleep beneath the stars. For a brief, proud period I was slender and fit. I gained a profound respect for wilderness and nature and the benign dark power of woods. I understand now, in a way I never did before, the colossal scale of the world. I found patience and fortitude that I didn't know I had. I had discovered an America that millions of people scarcely know exists ... Best of all, these days when I see a mountain, I look at it slowly and appraisingly, with a narrow, confident gaze and eyes of chipped granite.""One of the things I especially like about this book is the history that Bryson includes along the way. He shares interesting stories about the areas he's passing through and about how the trail was built. He also looks at America's unique relationship with nature, which includes some backwards policies of the U.S. Forest Service and the Parks Service. It's really a delight to read.This memoir has been criticized because Bryson doesn't hike the entire trail, but regardless of the distance, it's still a damn fine travelogue. This was his experience on the AT, which he shares with much humor and insight. I don't care that he hiked only 870 miles out of 2,100 -- the point was that he attempted it.!121!Bill Bryson is extremely annoying. I started out liking this book, but the further I went along, the more obnoxious I found the author's smarter-than-thou attitude. And that's a shame, too, because I was very interested in the subject matter and had the impression that Bryson wrote with a comedic edge. However, his sense of humor turns out to be quite bland, and consists mostly of making fun of everyone he meets. Get ready for adjectives like ""stupid"" and ""fat"" ... very high-brow. And don't worry, you'll hear the standard inbred jokes as he hikes through the South.Like hypocritical rants? You'll get plenty here; he eviscerates the National Park system, but that doesn't stop him from taking full advantage of all its amenities. He rips tourists who just stop by the AT to do quick hikes, eat cheeseburgers at fast-food restaurants, then hop in their cars and move on, and yet he spends much of the middle section of the book doing just that! He also rips unprepared hikers who don't know what they're doing ... much like the time later in the book when he leaves his windbreaker at home while hiking in the Presidentials; also, he sets out to hike the entire length of the AT, but gives up when he looks at a map in Gatlinburg and realizes -gasp- the AT is really long! Seriously? You didn't look at a map BEFORE you started hiking? Needless to say, he gave up immediately.Not that there's anything wrong with giving up. I guess this writer's just not for me - he comes across as having a little more disdain for the rest of the world than he has a right to.!121!OMG! This is the first book I have read by Bill Bryson and I LOVED it! I listened to it on audiobook and kept laughing out loud---it is hilarious! After living abroad for 20 years, Bryson moved to New Hampshire and lived near the Appalachian Trail. The Trail is ""an invitation to amble."" Bryson decided to hike the 2,100 trail from Georgia to Maine at the age of 44 and not in athletic shape. His friend, pseudonym name of Stephen Katz, joined him. Their preparations and actual adventures are told with such wit, clarity, and sarcasm that I felt I was hiking the trail with them. Their descriptions of people they met on the trail and in towns is fascinating.My favorite parts of the book included:* All the possible dangers of hiking: bears, snakes, mountain lions, injury, etc* Learning about and purchasing gear* Katz's first day on the Trail* A guide's story about people who don't do well on the Trail* Various waitress stories with Katz looking for loveBryson and Katz hiked in the summer of 1996 which is when two young women, Lollie Winans and Julie Williams, were killed in the Shenandoah mountains. I had already read Trailed: One Woman's Quest to Solve the Shenandoah Murders so I was very familiar with the tragedy. Bryson shares the conversations with hikers, store clerks, and others as this situation unfolded during his journey.Later in their hike, Bryson purchased the book Eight Bullets: One Woman's Story of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence about two women who were shot with eight bullets while enjoying the Trail. One woman died and one survived. This situation occurred about a decade before Bryson's hike. In general, hiking the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, the Camino de Santiago, and other trails is very safe. The number of people murdered on hiking trails is relatively small. I have added many of Bill Bryson's books to my TBR and have already started listening to the audiobook In a Sunburned Country which is about Australia. Bryson narrates it fabulously!!121!Definitely read the book if you're a fan of the outdoors and hiking. I learned about the book after watching the movie, and let me say, the book to me was much better.!121!4.5 Stars I’ve owned this mass market paperback for 6,945 years and I thought I read it about that long ago. I’m assuming I never added it to GR. Well, here you are.. I read it, it’s logged, hurrah! I thought about adding a pic of me hugging one of my favorite trees where I hike but, maybe later. I’m grateful I can hike a little bit with all of my medical issues and I’m not sure for how long. The woods are my favorite place, my love, my solace. Years ago (hindsight) when I was younger I planned on walking a little bit of the AT and camping but I never did..sigh. I used to look at one of the entries to it when going down the road to somewhere else in the woods back in the day. Well, the day is over .. if there is something you’re thinking about doing, do it! Still grateful for what I can do 🌲Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾!121!Travel writing does not get any better or any funnier than this. This is Bill Bryson at his very best,side splittingly funny.Bill Bryson sets out with his friend Katz to hike the Appalachian trail. The trail is picturesque,but for two men in their forties,it is still hard work.As he always does,Bryson digs up a whole lot of background detail and trivia about the trail. It's first rate entertainment. Katz may not be the ideal hiking companion but provides plenty of humour.There are lively encounters with fellow hikers along the way and even some disconcerting ones with wildlife. The trail can be dangerous too,as shown by the murder of some hikers in the past.It is a lot of hard work,sleeping rough in shelters and braving the elements.Eventually,Bryson has to concede that he will not be able to walk the entire trail.After that,he picks and chooses the spots where he hikes.And he is rather proud of himself for having walked as many miles as he has.Bryson's subsequent travel books would not necessarily maintain this quality. This book would later become a movie in 2015,with Robert Redford and Nick Nolte playing Bryson and Katz. But I doubt if the movie could do justice to the sheer comic brilliance of the book.!121!Undoubtedly an amusing, breezy read, full of the kind of fun and hilarity all the blurbs lead you to expect. For instance, ""Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old."" That had me laughing on the train.I can't say I liked this book quite as much as some of my friends seem to. On the one hand, I've had at least 1 semi-grueling backpacking experience with a companion who was wholly unprepared for a rigorous day hike, let alone several of them on consecutive days, weighed down by tents, bags, and water, except my experience was less hilarious and more infuriating (even in retrospect, though there was certainly some hilarity). I also found Bryson fairly amusing, his fears and hijinks recognizable and diverting. On the other hand, he's kind of an ass. Seemed like every person he met was a subject for mockery. He also went off on these long jeremiads over the ecological devastation we've wrought on the Eastern forests, without citing any sources whatsoever, or recommending solutions. Obviously I agreed with the substance of those rants, but the dripping sarcasm in his indignation was just so annoying. Good researchers cite sources, and good crusaders at least try to find answers to the world's problems. Bryson seemed like more of a gadfly: buzzing, bothersome, but impotent. In the end, what I really wanted was just more depth. More analysis of what the trail means to Americans, what it symbolizes, a more informed (and documented) record of the Park Service's transgressions, more comparisons to similar trails in other parts of the world.!121!Well, scratch the Appalachian Trail off my bucketlist. Bryson sets off to walk the Appalachian trail with only an extremely overpriced backpack (packed with equally ridiculously expensive gear), an old ""friend""  that he hadn't talked to in years and a will to find his next story. He quickly realized that the months of preparation he conducted (and the lack of months his friend prepared) were not nearly adequate. But on the plus side, he certainly found his story.As always, I absolutely enjoyed his signature sense of humor. Despite wandering around half crazed with fatigue, he still took the time to pen his quirky musings:
Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old.
Joking aside, this is a brutal trail (no matter what Cheryl from Wild may say. Her little pot-shots against The Appalachian Trail were not justified). The sheer willpower it takes to slog through ten to twenty trail miles a day simply boggles my mind. 
Distance changes utterly when you take the world on foot. A mile becomes a long way, two miles literally considerable, ten miles whopping, fifty miles at the very limits of conception.
I was weary just reading it - and he already most of the monotonous bits from his story. I appreciate how reading this allowed me to adventure vicariously and decide (most definitely) that I will never hike such a trail. Even part of it. 
I'm not touching that thing with a ten-foot pole
I'll stick to my wood-chipped half-mile paths in the local park, thank you very much.Audiobook Comments---Am a smidge annoyed that he did not narrate his own autobiography (well micro-autobiography of a trail adventure (are micro-autos a thing?))---Narrator (Rob McQuay) was great though. No complaints other than it wasn't Bryson.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail pressed all my favorite buttons: Humor. Adventure. Danger. Storytelling. Nature. Local/personal interest. Et cetera.I even liked that the author Bill Bryson is a American-Brit ex-pat/transplant and thus an outsider giving his opinion as a stranger in a strange land. Bryson's humorous, well-researched, yet relaxed writing is what I always hope for when embarking upon a book like this.A trek upon the Appalachian Trail is supposed to be relaxing, if strenuous, and if a bit of history and humor get mixed in then all the better. For those like myself who grew up in New England, the lure and legend of the trail was spoon-fed us from an early age, right along with Johnny Appleseed and the ride of Paul Revere. Those of us too lazy to make the actual hike can sit back and read Bryson's book while thinking about how swell a jaunt would be.                While I enjoyed hearing about the local spots I'm familiar with like Mt. Washington in New Hampshire (a hiker from Pepperell, MA the tiny town my mom is from is even mentioned, woohoo!), it's Bryson's relationship with his friend Katz, a larger-than-life character who joined him periodically on the trail, that really ties this whole book together. The hijinks are raised when Katz enters the scene, making a normal hike in the woods into an adventure, perhaps more than it needed to be, but I'm grateful either way!Bryson's writing and the personality that comes through made more palatable his occasional soapbox tangents. The guy loves nature preservation and he's not happy when man fucks with it, so every once in a while the reader must wade through a lecture on why the trail is essentially lucky to be alive. For all that, I loved this book just about in its entirety and look forward to reading more by Bill Bryson, a writer who I've taken an immediate shine to, a reader-writer bond strengthened by my own private pleasure at discovering we share December 8th as a birthday.!121!Going into this book, I really had no idea of what to expect from Bill Bryson. Even though I picked this book up based on Diane’s terrific review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), I had never read the author before and let’s face it - blurbs on the cover only tell you so much. You have to read and live with an author’s prose to get a feel for it. As far as travelogues go, I don’t read many: Paul Theroux, Mark Twain and Steinbeck’s Travels with Charley are the only ones that come to mind. So I plunged in and I’m happy I did.Finding a rich source of humor (Monty Python, Archer, S.J. Pearlman, Deadpool) is always like Christmas Day. For me, humor has always been the fuel to motor through tough times and Mr. Bryson delivers it by the tank full. This book has a score of laugh out loud moments all weaved into Bryson’s cultural and historical insights.Bryson lived abroad for years and upon returning to the United States decided to hike the Appalachian Trail. The trail is over 2000 miles long and extends from Georgia into Maine. Along the way, Bryson discourses on subjects that range from the history of the Appalachian Trail, the neglect and incompetence of the Forestry and Park services, pre-Colonial botanists, the potential flame ball that is Centralia, PA, the temperature extremes of Mount Washington (NH), trees, the constant threat of getting eaten by bears or hogtied by hillbillies and, of course, the hike itself. The long, long hike.My experience with hiking and outdoorsy stuff begins and ends with the Boy Scouts. For me, it was about smoking cigarettes in the woods, being able to indiscriminately pee on the local flora, fauna and the occasional fellow scout (the latter, accidently, of course) wearing the same clothes and not bathing for three days. “You packed extra underwear and socks, Ma? I hadn’t noticed.” “The tooth brush is green because I dropped it in the creek. Don’t worry, I used it anyway.”If I were to go hiking today, I don’t think I would have picked the guy Bryson ended up with. Stephen Katz was overweight, needy, impetuous but funny. Kind of like hiking with my brother-in-law, minus the funny. The two are an unrivaled comic pair and their hiking adventures are a highly recommended read.!121!When I chose this book I failed to understand the author’s intention. Look at the subtitle! I hadn't noted the words ""Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail"". This book is not for people who love hiking; it is not intended to increase love of the sport. It scarcely shows the pleasure one can derive from hiking. It is instead a commentary on America with some details about the Appalachian Trail. I have to admit my own fault in not carefully reading the complete title. I still must rate according to my own appreciation of the book. For me it was just OK.This book is full of griping and whining. From its start to almost the very end. At the end there is a line or two that shows appreciation for hiking. For the purpose of delivering an exciting tale the author begins by listing all the terrible things that can happen and have happened on the trail. Bryson warns of getting lost, being bitten by snakes, eaten by bears, mauled by mountain lions and even being murdered. The complaining doesn't stop there. He tells of unpleasant people on the trail, the weight of the pack, hunger and tiredness, the expense and idiocy of trekking gear, even abstinence from sex and family and TV and soda pop and Little Debbie cakes and beer. He goes on to bemoan pollution, park authorities, deficient maps, modern American urbanization and expansion of roads to the point where one is unable to w-a-l-k by foot anywhere. Sure, some of the gripes certainly are legitimate, but a whole book of griping is hard to take, and the focus is scarcely on the delight of hiking. I love hiking. Beware, by no means does the author and his buddy Stephen Katz travel the whole trail. Do not expect a complete trail guide. They trek 500 miles, starting at the southern end, and then stop for a break, totally worn out by their experiences. They each go home, but Bryson then decides to cover portions of the trail by making day trips using his car. At this point the topics covered shift from trail experiences to information about historical events that have occurred at various places near the trail. The book sidetracks to cover events of the Civil War (Stonewall Jackson and Harper's Ferry), oil and anthracite mining, the smoking, inextinguishable underground mine fires of Centralia, Pennsylvania, as well as the ecological devastation at abandoned zinc mines at Palmerton in the same state. I name but a few examples. After Bryson’s solitary day excursions by car the two buddies meet up again to trek in Maine, finishing off with the “100 Mile Wilderness”. Well, I will not tell you what happens there, but you can pretty much guess. Anyone who knows anything about longer hiking tours knows that planning and careful preparation are essential. This includes critically assessing one’s own capabilities. Who says one has to trek the whole trail anyway? They finally realize that! Pseudonyms are used to protect the identity of those spoken of. Stephen Katz is a pseudonym too. When you read the book you will not be surprised at the need to cover up true identities. Many extremely uncomplimentary things are said. There are some humorous lines. There are some interesting historical details about the trail. There are some relevant insights about trekking which can be drawn from the book if you ponder what happens:-the first and second day are always the hardest.-it is easy to get lost.-don’t walk alone and inform others of your itinerary. -plan carefully water availability.-have proper clothing; weather can radically change.-take only what you really need. Every ounce feels like a ton when it is on your back. After a trek you will feel as though you are flying. After a trek you will appreciate the wonder of a warm shower and cleanliness. After a trek you will appreciate what before you have taken for granted – the ease of walking without gear, cooked food, being clean, and the beauty of nature. I wish this book had much more emphasis on what trekking can give a person. The audiobook is narrated by Rob McQuay. He does a fine job. Easy to follow and at a good clip. He expresses through his intonation both the lines of humor and the author’s criticism of modern American trends. The disdain is heard. **************************After 9 chapters:I am not exactly enjoying this, even if there are a few amusing lines. So much complaining. Such poor planning. And tell me why is there so little about the beauty of nature? The point with hiking is not to partake in a race or a competition to determine who does it fastest, in one swipe or in parts. Why would anyone have to do the-whole-thing? That is not the point. I prefer the empty Swedish mountain ranges.But I haven't given up on the book.!121!Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/

After reading A Man Called Ove last week, I was afraid nothing would compare and I’d be stuck in book hangover mode unless I picked something totally different from what I normally read. I decided to go to the library website incognito in order to not get the typical porny recommendations made “just for me” and get the generally recommended ones instead. Obviously A Walk In The Woods was a book that appeared on the list and I remembered way back when I was thinking about reading Wild a certain Georgia peach said I should read this instead because at least if I hated it she was almost certain I’d at least get a couple of laughs. And she was correct. Right from the start Bryson declares . . . 
I wanted a little of that swagger that comes with being able to gaze at a far horizon through eyes of chipped granite and say with a slow, manly sniff, “Yeah, I’ve shit in the woods.”
I pretty much decided right at that point the author was probably my people. To begin with he described his state of living as 
“waddlesome sloth,”
 which is a lifestyle I support 110%. He followed that up with a shopping trip to buy necessities such as 
“a big knife for killing bears and hillbillies.” 
 And then he sealed the deal by taking his old friend Katz along for the hike . . . .
“Jesus, I smell like Jeffrey Dahmer’s refrigerator.” 
In case the above didn’t clue you in, Katz isn’t exactly what you’d call politically correct. You’ve been warned so don’t come crying to me about what a disgusting manbearpig he was. Here’s another tidbit at what my new best friend Katz brings to the table . . . .
Good lord, look at you! What have you been doing? You’re filthy. You haven’t been screwing hogs again, have you, Bryson? . . . They’re not clean animals, you know, no matter how attractive they may look after a month on the trail. And don’t forget we’re not in Tennessee anymore. It’s probably not even legal here – at least without a note from the vet. . . . Come sit down and tell me all about it. So what was here name – Bossy? Did she squeal a lot?
These two were a hoot. A regular Odd Couple taking the reader on a potential life-threatening comedy of errors. From freak snowstorms to uninvited tag-alongs on their journey.(SIDENOTE: Apparently the role of the uber annoying Mary Ellen is played by none other than the lady who voices this delightful little lady in the movie version . . . . 

While Ms. Schaal makes for quite the entertaining cartoon voice I have a feeling I’d want to stab the non-animated version should we ever meet. /ENDSIDENOTE)To a possible bear attack that had me casting John Candy in the role of Bill Bryson due to this fond memory . . . . 

The only reason this gets 4 Stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that . . . 

While it’s obvious that Bryson fell in love with The Appalachian Trail on his journey, there is a lot of info dumping that occurs because of this love. The history of national parks/the Army Corps of Engineers/the forestry industry as well a detailed inventory of flora and fauna and random tidbits and “fun” (in a macabre sense of the term) facts regarding different locations along the trail sometimes left my mind wandering.That being said, A Walk In The Woods is an adventure I won’t soon forget. I didn't know until this weekend that there’s a film version. I hope to check it out soon because . . . . 

Nick Nolte was more than a bit too old for the role, but still might end up being the  perfect choice for Katz!!121!I chose this book in hopes it would rekindle my appetite for hiking. The book easily did that. I also found this to be such a pleasurable read. I looked forward at every stolen opportunity to read another chapter. It delivered each time.!121!Bill Bryson’s – A Walk in the Woods follows Bryson as he and his old mate, Katz, attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail. This endeavour is no small thing, the AT is a 2,000 + mile hiking trail up and down the East coast of the US, linking Georgia in the South to Maine in the North. It traverses around 11 states and is one of the most popular and well-known walking trails around.This book started off in true Bryson style – I guffawed at the pages at times. I find Bryson very funny, and when he’s on song he really is hilarious. Most of the funny, initial parts of the story involved the planning for the adventure and his perspectives of his mate, Katz. Katz is a funny bloke, often hopeless, sometimes moody, awkward, forever hungry and oblivious to his own manners. As the boys commence this herculean endeavour Bryson describes the wonderful surroundings of the AT, the interesting people they meet, interesting service situations and of course – being Bryson, fascinating historical facts and figures of the AT and anything associated with it. One particularly interesting character who managed to attach themselves to Katz and Bryson was the ‘fleshy’ Mary Ellen. She joined the lads earlier in the trip, dropping into and out of the story. Mary Ellen was quite well known amongst the other hikers due to her interesting manner. A typical conversation might go something like this:“When’s your birthday?” Mary Ellen asks Bill.“December the eighth.”“That’s Virgo.” says Mary Ellen.“No, actually it’s Sagittarius.” replied Bill.“Whatever.” Mary Ellen then abruptly says “Jeez you guys stink!” “Well, uh, we’ve been walking.”Mary Ellen says “Me, I don’t sweat. Never have. Don’t dream either.”“Everybody dreams,” Katz said.“Well I don’t.”………..and on it goes. Lofty stuff like that. I love reading pointless dialogue when I’m in the mood, especially when a character like Mary Ellen is directing proceedings. Conversations with Mary Ellen can, and usually do, end up anywhere, often with hilarious consequences.However, this book started to run out of puff for me at about a third of the way through. Firstly, Bryson and Katz decided not to walk the trail in its entirety, and in fact ‘only’ walked around a third of the AT by the time they reached the endpoint in Maine. Sure, many people walk this trail in sections and come back to do it in sections. But I was really hoping we would see genuine, gruelling, hardship of Bryson and his mate traversing the entirety of this track. We would’ve learned more about the guys themselves, the people they met and some of their thoughts and struggles – which in themselves can provide some chuckles. Secondly, I get the feeling Bryson got a bit bored with the whole thing – day after day, tree after tree, mountain after mountain. This resonated for me as such the book turn south. We see a lot more ‘drier’ factual padding. Often interesting, but it became more of a historical piece of the AT and current political and environmental challenges, rather than an adventure of the odd couple.I must admit though, this book inspired me to call my best mate, Joe, who lives in Adelaide, and he has agreed to go hiking with me in Tasmania in spring later in 2021. Something to plan, get a bit excited about and train for. I was surprised he agreed so readily – Joe, dislikes camping and hiking as much as I do. I also get on Joe’s nerves a little bit sometimes (I can tell) he’s more the thoughtful, quiet type, whereas I’m not and not. So, it could be fun!!3 Stars!121!Imagine a grueling, four-month wilderness trek along the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Your guide: an intellectual, who lived half his life in England, well versed in geology, zoology, ecology and pretty much all of the other ‘ologies.’ Yet, this far from ordinary guide summons the sparkle of Twain, and of Billy Crystal. Picture all of this for a sense of what can be found inside the covers of Bill Bryson’s ""A Walk in the Woods."" Bryson, a self-deprecating intellectual of the first order, provides massive helpings of horse-laughing humor that are pleasantly painful to read. The compulsion to read aloud ""Walk’s"" funnier passages to friends and family overwhelms, as does the desire to pass the book on to others after the warmth of the last page flickers. Bryson grew up in Iowa. While in his twenties, he moved to England where he spent 20 years writing for British and American publications. In 1996 he and his family returned to the United States, settling in New Hampshire. One day, he “happened on a path that vanished into the wood on the edge of town.” That path was a tiny segment of the Appalachian Trail: a continuous 2,100-mile, mostly-wilderness trail along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains. Intrigued, Bryson thought, what better way to reacquaint himself with his native land, and at the same time: “It would get me fit after years of waddlesome sloth."" After thorough research, Bryson determines his undertaking would be difficult, requiring a companion. Exhausting all of his best choices, Bryson settles on Steve Katz, an old high school buddy. Katz, an overweight and out of shape, X - Files addicted, Snicker munching, surprisingly fetching sidekick becomes the focal point of much of Walk’s hilarity and pathos.A number of unforgettable characters pop up along the trail. Most memorable is the gratingly obnoxious Mary Ellen, who after she had tagged along for several days, Bryson and Katz ditch using an elaborate deception. “She was, as Katz forever termed her in a special tone of awe, a piece of work."" They encounter Bob, the world’s foremost authority on everything. Bryson and Katz spend several days with the delightful John Connolly, a New York schoolteacher who had been hiking the trail a bit at a time for 19 years. One night the three camp with seventeen Boy Scouts and three adult supervisors, “all charmingly incompetent.” After watching a night of the scout’s ineptness: “Even Katz agreed that this was better than TV.""Along the way, Bryson painlessly inserts lessons of history, geology, entomology, and more. We learn about the changes acid rain has brought to the wild, and he recounts the stories of the southern pine beetle, the smoky madtom and wooly adelgids, and about Daniel Boone, Henry David Thoreau and Stonewall Jackson. Bryson delivers an extended geology lesson on the tectonic formation of the 470 million year-old Appalachian Mountains that palatably educates. While praising some of their employees, Bryson effectively and mercilessly bashes the U.S. Forest Service (road builders for the logging industry – “eight times the total mileage of America’s interstate highway system,"" the National Park Service (“actually has something of a tradition of making things extinct""), and the Army Corps of Engineers (“they don’t build things very well"").  Bryson makes his environmental bent abundantly clear. But, his lessons rarely become preachy. They reflect the all too human predisposition to seek the easy way, the momentary thrill, and always at a cost. Without accusation, Bryson reminds us of those often easy to ignore environmental costs. Bill Bryson’s ""A Walk in the Woods"" lovingly opens a window to “an America that millions of people scarcely know exists.” There are problems to solve along this great, mountain forest trail. Yet, the air intoxicates. The sights are unforgetable. And the smile remains!121!In ""A Walk in the Woods"", Bryson narrates his experiences on the Appalachian Trail which stretches 2000+ miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, passing through eleven states and populated with all kinds of peril imaginable. As Bryson saysThe woods were full of peril - rattlesnakes and water moccasins and nests of copperheads; bobcat, bears, coyotes, wolves, and wild boar; loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex; merciless fire ants and ravening blackfly; poison ivy, poison sumac, poison salamanders; even a scattering of moose lethally deranged by a parasitic worm that burrows a nest in their brains and befuddles them into chasing hapless hikers through remote, sunny meadows and into glacial lakes.Of course he's exaggerating... but it's the kind of exaggeration one nervously indulges in to mask one's apprehension, the reader feels. And combined the trials of the trail, the fact that Bryson is supremely unfit to do any kind of extended strenuous activity, does not know the first thing about hiking, and is accompanied by the recovering alcoholic Stephen Katz who is even less fit does nothing to alleviate his apprehensions.He sets of gamely, however - and what we get is a travelogue-cum-science-cum-history-cum-geography lesson. It is fascinating.What I love about Bill Bryson is the casual way in which he feeds you nuggets of information: history, geography, science and whatnot. He packages them in digestible chunks in between personal anecdotes sprinkled with humorous observations, so that subjects which by right should be boring, become exciting.The first part of the hike from Springer Mountain in Georgia to the town of Front Royal in Virginia, was completed in one stretch by Bryson and Katz, with motorised breaks in between - for not being professional hikers, walking through was a virtual impossibility for them. This part is extremely amusing, some parts being worthy of Wodehouse himself. The idiosyncrasies of various hikers, the sorry condition of the night shelters, and the colourful personality of Katz (who manages to fall afoul of the irate husband of a lady he propositions, even in the midst of hiking, believe it or not!) - all make for engrossing reading. The second part is completed by Bryson in bits and pieces until the very last bit in Maine, where he is rejoined by Katz (and they end up in dropping out halfway, after Katz manages to lose himself in the woods for a brief interval - a scary episode). It is here that we are treated to the fascinating history of the trail. The story of Centralia, a once thriving mining community in Pennsylvania now degraded to ghost town status, due to a coal fire in the underground mine started in 1962 and still burning, slowly eating away the town, is especially rivetting and disturbing. Bryson does not hide his ire at the authorities for America's disappearing woodlands, as well as his contempt for a populace addicted to the transient pleasures of instant sensual gratification.It was a thoroughly enjoyable read to finish the year off. I will be reading more of Bryson in the future.!121!Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.!121!“I don’t recall a moment in my life when I was more acutely aware of how providence has favored the land to which I was born.” (3.5 stars)This is a book that a lot of people love. I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of some of the people he encounters a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it.!121!I have read most of Bill Bryson's books and they are all good-- excellent even. His gift is in his ability to detect the humor in any situation. Where you or I might see a man walking down the street he sees something, and articulates it so well, packed with humor. But this book is his best. The reason, I think, is that it takes him out of his element. His natural writing style is this so-called ""travel writing"" genre-- the idea that someone goes somewhere and writes about it and their time there. But most ""travel writers"" don't hike over half of the AT, that's unheard of. And the fact that Bryson at middle age decided to take on such a task with no real background in backpacking, let alone for months at a time, is downright impressive. So the premise of the book is already good before you even start reading. Then the book just blows you away. The man can describe nature with the best of them but his expertise is in describing human interactions. And, perhaps, that's why he chose the AT. There are indeed some interesting people who decide to take the plunge and walk the trail from end to end. Among them are Stephen Katz, Bryson's sidekick from earlier adventures in France, who is now overweight and obsessed with junk food-- admittedly Katz gives Bryson ample material to work with. Then there is the woman who hikes with them and camps with them for a few weeks. She acts as though they are the problem, forcing the partnership on her as it were, but we quickly discover that her own insecurities are at the root of her behavior. Bryson navigates her personality in a delicate but oh so funny way. Whether you hike or not, laugh or not, enjoy Bryson or not you should read this it will change your mind or affirm what you already knew-- Bryson is the best at what he does.!121!Let me just get this out of the way first: Sorry, Trish! I couldn't help myself! I have no willpower! I am officially the world's worst buddy reader!Right, as for the book... I enjoyed it. The only Bryson I've read before this was his book about hiking in my native UK and, perhaps because this book deals with territory I'm a lot less familiar with, I preferred this one. I enjoyed Bryson's wry, despairing sense of humour. I enjoyed his interactions with his walking-buddy, Katz (not sure of the spelling; I listened to the audiobook) who was both hilariously annoying and quite sweet on occasion. I enjoyed Bryson's many educational tangents into the history of the area they were currently walking through.Why only four stars then? Well, there isn't really anything wrong with the book that I can exactly put my finger on, but I just didn't enjoy it quite enough to warrant the full five stars. I wish I could tell you why; I just can't quite bring myself to give it five out of five. Maybe some of the people they encounter are just a little too irritating to be thoroughly enjoyable. Maybe some of the historical tangents are just a little too tangential. Maybe I'm just an arse.Despite this, I certainly enjoyed it enough to read more Bryson in the future. (That's kind of redundant isn't it? It's not like I can read more Bryson in the past...)!121!With the never-ending pandemic and the turmoil of the U.S. presidential elections I felt I could use some Bill Bryson!He is a writer filled with versatility. This book is on the Appalachian trail stretching all the way from Georgia right up into Maine. But the book is more than that – there are marvelous disquisitions on the flora and fauna and the geology of the region and some of the very informative people he met. And be warned – do not read this book in public unless you want to induce stares while reading Bill Bryson’s humour and wit! I laughed loudly on numerous occasions!Bill and his friend Katz never made it across the entire length of the Appalachian trail. It did not take them long to realize that their initial endeavour was a little too much for hapless comfortable middle-aged folk. For example, the trail in Maine has frequent crossings of bogs, streams and ponds adding to the weight of the backpacks they were carrying as they tended to fall into the murky waters.If you have idealistic visions of doing a long-distance hike you should read this book.Chapter 6 – while hikingLife takes on a neat simplicity, too. Time ceases to have any meaning. When its dark, you go to bed, and when it is light again you get up, and everything in between is just in between. It’s quite wonderful really.You have no engagements, commitments, obligations, or duties; no special ambitions and only the smallest, least complicated of worlds; you exist in a tranquil tedium, serenely beyond the reach of exasperation, “far removed from the seats of strife”, as the early explorer and botanist William Bartram put it. All that is required is that you trudge.There is no point in hurrying because you are not actually going anywhere. However far or long you plod, you are always in the same place: in the woods… But most of the time you don’t think. No point. Instead, you exist in a kind of mobile Zen mode.Of course, on other days - Chapter 7We walked for four days and the rain fell tirelessly, with an endless, typewriter patter. The trail everywhere became boggy and slick. Puddles filled every dip and trough. Mud became a feature of our lives. We trudged through it, stumbled and fell in it, knelt in it, set our packs down in it, left a streak of it on everything we touched.!121!It's the longest armchair hike I've ever taken and I've enjoyed every minute of it. I know I will never do this for real so this is next best. I enjoyed reading about the history of the AT and all the other stories that BB included in the report of his adventures.!121!Nature writing and a travelogue with ""oomph""!Perhaps it was a fit of angst dealing with his own personal version of a mid-life crisis that led Bill Bryson to tackle the challenge of hiking the 2,100 mile Appalachian Trail! It was certainly a solid understanding of his own personality and clear recognition of his own physical and mental limitations that prompted him to invite his friend, Stephen Katz, an overweight and out of shape recovering alcoholic with an inordinate fondness for snack foods and cream soda to accompany him on this daunting challenge. The demands of the AT ultimately proved too much for Bryson and Katz who sensibly (and with an almost relieved sense of philosophical acceptance) decided to abandon the notion of a complete through hike. But the resulting story, drawn from Bryson's daily journal of the summer's efforts, is an overwhelming success and pure joy in the reading.A WALK IN THE WOODS is an extraordinary, entertaining travelogue on both the AT - the Appalachian Trail - and the people and places of small town America that dot the trail's path along the eastern seaboard from Georgia to Maine. At the same time, it is much, much more. Bryson is scathing in his political commentary and almost enraged criticism of the ongoing state of mismanagement and the sadly misguided policies of both the Parks and Forest Services of the US government. A WALK IN THE WOODS is also a deeply moving introspective examination on the nature of friendship, family, perseverance, joy and despondency. As he and Katz amble along rock strewn trails dappled with sunlight broken by the leafy forest canopy, Bryson frequently, effortlessly and almost without our even noticing the change, wanders metaphorically off the main trail and onto a side path of lightweight but nonetheless informative and educational sidebars of nature writing on an amazingly wide variety of topics. Glaciation, bears, bugs, ecology, continental drift, hypothermia, hypoxia and weather are only a few examples of the topics which he elucidates for the lay reader with his clear, concise prose.Then there is the humour! It is perhaps an understatement to say that, in this regard, Bryson has a rare gift. He has treated his readers to laughs originating in every imaginable corner of the vast world of humour - wry sardonic wit; biting satire; slapstick; self effacement; sarcasm and insults; fear; and even extended comedy sketches worthy of stage or television. His description of the astonishingly stupid and entirely self-absorbed fellow hiker Mary Ellen who has the annoying habit of constantly clearing her sinuses with a grating honk is definitely laugh-out-loud material.Pure entertainment and enjoyment from first page to last. I believe Bill Bryson would consider it a compliment if I suggested that A WALK IN THE WOODS is the first book I've ever read with a smile on my face during every single moment of the reading. Highly recommended - even if you've never spent a single night under nylon in the woods.Paul Weiss!121!This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.I am terribly disappointed by the fact that I did not fall in love with this book. When I was choosing a book to read, I took one look at the ratings for this book on Goodreads and knew that I had to read this book right away. Seriously, every single one of my friends on Goodreads gave this book either a 4 or 5 star rating. And they said it was funny. I love funny. I knew that I would just love this book.I didn't love it. I was actually bored for most of this book. I do admit that this isn't the kind of book that I usually read but a humorous non-fiction story about hiking the Appalachian Trail sounded fabulous. I really did enjoy the parts of the book that focused on Bill and Stephen's adventures on the trail. I just wish that the focus of the book would have stayed with Bill and Stephen.The problem was that there was just too much other stuff crammed into this book. I sometimes felt like I was reading a textbook....a well-written textbook...but a textbook nonetheless. In this short little book, I learned about the history of the Appalachian Trail, some geology, information about bears, trees, the National Park Service, birds, and various other things. A lot of the time the book just felt dry and information packed. I was glad that some of this information was shared in a fun way that actually put a smile on my face. All too often, I felt like skipping entire sections of the book so that I could get back to the actual hike.I had hoped that this was going to be one of those side splitting funny kind of books. It had its moments of humor but nothing that made me do anything more than crack a smile. There was no laughing out loud and the parts that were funny seemed to be rather sparse. Don't get me wrong, I can tell that Bill Bryson is a very funny guy but I need a lot more of those kind of moments to offset the parts of the book that were dry. I did notice that there is a movie based on this book that is soon to be released. I actually am looking forward to that movie because I suspect that it will focus on the parts of the book that I really enjoyed....the actual hike. I don't think that there will be too many geology or history lessons found in the film. I am thinking that I actually want to go an see the movie when it comes out and I never go see movies.I am not going to be recommending this book but I am seriously in the minority with this one. I would tell readers to pick it up if it sounds interesting to you. You may be one of the many who really love it. I still really wish that I was one of the many readers who love it. I received an advance reader edition of this book from Blogging for Books for the purpose of providing an honest review.","['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Nature', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook']"
Yes Please (Hardcover),Amy Poehler,3.85,523323,2014,"In Amy Poehler’s highly anticipated first book, Yes Please, she offers up a big juicy stew of personal stories, funny bits on sex and love and friendship and parenthood and real life advice (some useful, some not so much), like when to be funny and when to be serious. Powered by Amy’s charming and hilarious, biting yet wise voice, Yes Please is a book full of words to live by.","This is not a comedy book. I mean, it's funny. Amy Poehler can't write a book and not be funny, because she's Amy fuckin' Poehler. But (and this is not the first time I'm going to compare the two memoirs) where Tina Fey's Bossypants contained humorous essays written specifically for the purpose of being funny, Poehler's does not. Everything is presented in a straightforward, matter-of-fact, fashion, and although a lot of the book is very, very funny, it never seems like this was the specific goal behind the essays. This is also not a book about comedy. Although Amy Poehler discusses her time on improv groups in Chicago and New York, Saturday Night Live, and Parks and Recreation, she never gets more in-depth than ""then we moved to New York and started working at this theater."" Her time on SNL is reduced to a chapter of brief (but fantastic) anecdotes. Amy Poehler is renowned for her ability to play vastly different characters - somewhere on the internet is a photo gallery of all her Second City characters - but she never discusses what goes into each character. The closest we get is this description of her preparing her Hillary Clinton imitation and finally getting a bead on the character by playing her as someone who is tired of always being the smartest person in the room. Okay, so it's not a comedy book, and it's not a book about comedy, and it's really not even much of a memoir - Poehler does not discuss her divorce because ""it is too sad and too personal. I also don't like people knowing my shit."" So what, exactly, is Yes Please?It feels weird to classify this book as a self-help book. But that's what I got out of it. Maybe your experience with Poehler's book will be different, but as I was reading it, the parts that left the greatest impressions on me are the ones where she is demonstrating how to be a good person. The title itself references this - Poehler spends some time discussing how the improv rule of always replying with ""yes, and..."" is also a good rule for life, and how she tacks ""please"" onto that because Amy Poehler is truly, genuinely, wonderfully nice, and that's always refreshing. But lest you think she's some kind of pushover, rest assured that Amy Poehler is also a badass who gets what she wants, and if you pay attention, she can teach you how to do that:""When someone is being rude, abusing their power, or not respecting you, just call them out in a really obvious way. Say, 'I can't understand why you are being rude because you are the concierge and this is the part of the evening where the concierge helps me.' Act like they are an actor who has forgotten what part they are playing. It brings the attention back to them and gives you a minute to calm down so you don't do something silly like burst into tears or break their stupid fucking glasses.""She also teaches you how to be good at what you do, in a very good essay called ""Treat Your Career Like a Bad Boyfriend"":""Now, before I extend this metaphor, let me make a distinction between career and creativity. Creativity is connected to your passion, that light inside you that drives you. That joy that comes when you do something you love. That small voice that tells you, 'I like this. Do this again. You are good at it. Keep going.' That is the juicy stuff that lubricates our lives and helps us feel less alone in the world. Your creativity is not a bad boyfriend....You have to care about your work but not about the result. You have to care about how good you are and how good you feel, but not about how good people think you are or how good people think you look.""I don't want to imply that this is all heavy, here's-how-to-be-a-successful-person stuff. There's lightness in this book, and like I said, it's funny and fluffy, but there's a solid gold center deep within this seemingly light read that makes it stand out from other comedy memoirs I've read. I treated this book as a manual on how to become Amy Poehler, and there are worse things we could be. Have I mentioned that Amy Poehler is nice? She's so nice. She does the same thing Tina Fey did in her book where she lists a lot of the people who work on her TV show with her and it's basically an excuse for her to gush over how much she likes the people she works with (she calls Aubrey Plaze ""a big-hearted warrior""). She spends a long chapter talking about her sons and how much she loves them. Tiny Fey's book featured a chapter called ""We Don't Care if You Like It (One in a Series of Love Letters to Amy Poehler)."" Amy Poehler's book returns the favor by including an acrostic poem about Tina Fey, which might seem disingenuous, but it's clear on every page how much these two great people love each other:""Sometimes Tina is like a very talented bungee-jumping expert. All it takes is for Tina to softly say, 'We can do this, right?' and I suddenly feel like I can jump off a bridge.""I don't know how you guys reacted to that line, but when I read it I had to put the book down and immediately send a text to my best friend telling her I loved her. That's the effect Amy Poehler's book had on me: it taught me how to do what I wanted, how to feel good about myself, how to deal with whatever terrible things life throws at you, and it reminded me to be kind. And it's pretty fucking funny, so there's that.!121!YES REALLY. I almost gave this two stars, except it includes George Clooney and that would be a crime. This book is fine. It didn't charm me. It actually took me about three or four days to read 288 pages, which is funny because a lot of those pages don't include any actual words (she's got a ton of photocopies and inspirational signs intermixed with the text). It just wasn't as fun to read as I anticipated. The problem is that she spends most of the book talking about how hard it is to write a book, or how she struggles with her self perception, or how she doesn’t like people knowing her business. (Incidentally, I think self-perception is an extremely valuable topic for women and teenagers, but perhaps not what I was interested in reading when I picked this up.) Sometimes she’s able to turn the “I don’t actually want to tell you anything about myself” into a pretty funny chapter, like when she writes out the descriptions of divorce self-help books she’d like to write. (Spoiler alert: she doesn’t want to talk about her relationship with Will Arnett at all, which is certainly her right.)But this means that she skips over many of the periods of her life that I was most interested in, like the founding of UCB and her subsequent success. She goes through a lot of, “Then we got a bigger theater, and then a bigger one, and then I was hired at SNL."" For most of the book, I felt like she was skipping over the truly interesting side stories. There are some anecdotes from SNL and Parks and Rec, but there are surprisingly few given how much time she's spent on both shows.Then again, back to George Clooney:
On the day of the awards I simply asked George Clooney’s people to check and make sure George was okay with my sitting next to him at some point during the broadcast. “Of course!” said George’s people, after not asking him. I knew enough not to ask them to check with George and see if it was okay to sit on his lap. This was a request better saved for the last minute and in person. Or better yet, when the time came, I would just sit on his lap without even asking. As the old saying goes, “Don’t ask for permission to sit on George Clooney’s lap, beg for forgiveness once you do.”So I sat on George’s lap, and ever the pro, George asked me what kind of bit I was cooking up. I told him when they cut to me in the audience after announcing my nomination for best comedy actress I was going to act totally engrossed in talking to him. I told him I thought it would be funny if we were just flirting and laughing. He understood immediately and handed me a glass of champagne. I told him if I won there was a very good chance I would kiss him hard on the mouth. He responded, “That’s not a bad Sunday.” As the camera cut to me he whispered in my ear, “The thing about making movies is …”
Perhaps if I’d listened to this as an audiobook, I might have enjoyed it more. When I went back to read some sentences over and consciously tried to hear her voice, I definitely thought some of it was funnier. But overall, I vacillated between two and three stars, and landed on three only because this is Amy Poehler’s book. YES, REALLY.!121!It breaks my heart to give this book one star.I love Amy Poehler. In fact I love every member of that early two-thousands (the decade, not the century) female Saturday Night Live cast ensemble: Poehler, Fey, Rudolph, Dratch.

I often mentally include Kristen Wiig in the mix, too, because she’s fantastic, but she was sort of late to the party, having joined SNL a year before Dratch and Fey left.But as I was saying, I think highly of Poehler. I enjoy her comedy, her intelligence, her personality overall. But I didn’t like this book.To me, Yes Please reads more like a scatterbrained diary than the well-crafted memoir I had been hoping for. Very little of the book seems to have been composed with any forethought; it’s as though Poehler were performing improv in “lit” form. Except while she may be a master of the art on a stage, her improvisational talent doesn’t really migrate to the written page. Her stories meander along without any real segue between them, each having a very “oh and by the way” aspect to it. Maybe it was meant to be random and incoherent but it just didn’t work for me. At one point in the book Poehler mentions her addiction to self-googling, so in many ways I am hoping she doesn’t stumble across this review because I’d hate to imagine her feelings being hurt by it, so maybe it’s best that no one votes for it.In other words, do what you guys normally do.!121!No, thank you.I was supposed to love this book and as I always do when I find myself super disappointed, I looked back through other reviews to see if I was alone. I don't think I am alone, but no one is expressing my disappointment quite how I need it to be expressed, so I get to do that myself this time around.I just kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting. The moment it was going to get good and awesome had to be right around the corner! Soon I would get past all the filler and all the fluff and dig into the heart of the book! It would be so great! I was so excited!And then I realized I had under fifty pages left.In the book, I waded through:A lot of celebrity name droppingI never figured out if it was supposed to be ironic, sarcastic, cute... I'm not sure. There is no way to do this that isn't obnoxious. Even with a disclaimer about it being obnoxious, it is still obnoxious. If you genuinely, really need to tell a story about your friend who happens to be a famous celebrity person, and they are really a part of the story, by all means, please tell it. But if there is no story, or one that is only half-told or glossed over.... There is no point. A lot of filler. Her parents wrote parts of it. And then some other dude wrote part of it. And then there was a chapter of footnotes as a joke, which was super funny back in 1990 something, but which really just take up space and make reading difficult. Lists! Copy pasted emails! There was a lot of writing about writing a book. Hey, Amy? JUST DO THE THING.A lot of confusion: Stories started and stopped. Kindergarten, mid-twenties, what? Are we going back to kindergarten? Did I miss something? Is that thread going to be picked up again? How does this connect? TRANSITION SENTENCES WOULD HELP.A lot of trying to be funny... and not being funny. Which is weird because I think Amy is a very funny person. But the book comes off as cloying, it's too much ""THIS IS FUNNY"" and not enough content. It feels like trying (and also not trying at the same time. Maybe this book is better than I thought because that really is a momentous feat). Maybe it just didn't translate well to print. I don't know. The highlight of the book for me was the mention of Gavin de Becker's The Gift of Fear. Because that book is fantastic and true. I like that Amy pointed out exactly why it is awesome and why the situation with the producer was uncomfortable (she said no, he kept asking). De Becker has helped me to identify these little things that feel ""off"" to me and allowed me to pinpoint why, so I appreciate this type of thing. But now, I'm reviewing The Gift of Fear instead of this book. And if that's my main takeaway, something is wrong.!121!A non chronological Audiobook memoir by famous comedian Amy Poehler.  A little bit of everything, childhood, parents, improv beginnings, pregnancy, motherhood, divorce, sex, drugs, pudding, career, Tina, womanhood, time travel, the Biz, Parks and Recreation, SNL, more SNL, and, lastly, little bits of SNL sprinkled into every other topic that you may think is not related to SNL, but somehow is.I start to think memoirs are not my thing, didn't care much for Poehler's, Fey's or Barrymore's. I've found them all somewhat interesting, yet not really enjoyable. I've never watched SNL. I know it's there, I know it's cool, I know I should watch it, but it doesn't really air over here so. Anyway, I'm positive this would totally hit it with any SNL fan. Amy Poehler is one badass dudess, you can tell even if it is your first time hearing her, and she's probably gonna make you smile or laugh in many chapters, specially if you are fond of her.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2014] [329p] [Memoir] [Audiobook] [Funny] [Almost Recommendable] [SNL] [more SNL] [Badass Poehler] ----------------------------------------------- Un audiolibro de memoria no cronológica por la famosa comediante Amy Poehler.  Un poco de todo, infancia, padres, comienzos en improvisación, embarazo, maternidad, divorcio, sexo, drogas, bizcochos, carrera, feminidad, Tina, viaje en el tiempo, Parks and Recreation, SNL, más SNL, y por último, pedacitos de SNL esparcidos en cualquier otro tema que uno pensaría no está relacionado con SNL, pero que de alguna forma está.Empiezo a pensar que las memorias no son lo mío, no me pareció mucho ni la de Poehler, Fey o Barrymore. Las encontré algo interesantes, pero no realmente disfrutables. Nunca vi SNL. Sé que está ahí, sé que es copado, sé que debería mirarlo, pero no es que lo pasen por acá. En fin, estoy seguro que esto resultaría genial para cualquier fan de SNL. Amy Poehler es una tipa fantástica, lo podés ver inclusive escuchándola por primera vez, y probablemente te hará sonreir o reir en muchos capítulos, especialmente si es que te agrada.-----------------------------------------------

Good Christ – just obtaining a library copy of this f*&^%$g book was like going on an adventure. After my third trek down to the local bibliotheca, I finally had success.

Look at the happy!You’re probably asking yourself “if she’s such a Poehler fangirl, why didn’t she just go to the B&N and grab herself a copy????” Well, you see … I am cheap.Yes Please also wasn’t getting real stellar ratings and reviews so I decided to err on the side of caution. Turns out reading a synopsis can be really helpful sometimes. You see, the blip pretty much lays it right out there that this is a book containing “real life advice” and “words to live by.” If you’re expecting another Bossy Pants or Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, you aren’t going to find it here. 

Yeah, I know. Here’s some helpful advice from Amy herself:

It took me a loooooooonnnnnnng time (like half the book) to wrap my brain around the fact that the belly laughs were going to be few and far between, but once I did, I was able to enjoy Yes Please for what it was . . . a book of the dos and don’ts/successes and failures that made Amy Poehler who she is today. If you’re a young puppy whose experiences in the world of Poehler revolve around maybe seeing a couple of Weekend Update reruns or watching the Golden Globes, you’re probably going to be super disappointed in this book and quickly realize this about Amy Poehler:

On the other hand, if you are a crazy fangirl who has followed her career since waaaay back in the days of the Upright Citizens Brigade and her break into fame in the comedy classic “Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigalow” (see first .gif above) like me, you’re still gonna like it.Amy Poehler has been one of my imaginary BFFs for over 15 years now. She’s made me laugh ‘til I cried more times than I can count and brought constant funny to her term on SNL. She was she a breakout star from her first appearance

and continued to deliver until her final episode

(After which she left to make “Parks and Recreation” – a show I feel will go down in the history books as one of the best of all time).Amy Poehler is who I want to be when I grow up. Not only has she performed in some of the funniest skits on television:

(she writes about this one in the book and just thinking about it made me almost wet myself.)Not only does she have the BEST friends in the universe (Tina Fey and Seth Meyers in case you live under a bridge somewhere) and not only has she totally humped Justin Timberlake on stage, but she has proved time and again that 

She offers simple yet awesome advice in Yes Please. Stuff like 
 “The talking about the thing isn’t the thing. The doing of the thing is the thing.”
 She reminds us all that in order to achieve success, hard work should be expected, but also realizes how lucky she was to be one of the people whose career and passion were one and the same. For the rest of us who aren’t so lucky, Poehler encourages us to keep listening to that little voice inside ourselves that says “I like this. Do this again. You are good at it.” Yes Please was one giant ""love cookie"" so I'm giving it 4 Stars (while realizing it would more than likely receive 2 Stars max were it not written by Amy Poehler). For those of you who end up not liking it, I think Amy would probably say

But if you do happen to find yourself more than a little disappointed in your feelings about Yes Please, might I recommend to drown your sorrows Leslie Knope style . . .

And if that doesn’t work, the surefire cure for any ailment is . . . 

MORE COWBELL!!121!This was pretty good! 😄I have the paperback but I listened to it on audio. She read the book herself and I love that. You get all of the true feelings when they read their own work. I loved looking at all of the pictures in the book as well. My copy is a small paperback and it has those soft glossy pages that you love to snif. 😄 And all bookaholics know what I mean. I actually sat down my phone to sniff the book again while reviewing. 😂The book is set up in different sections as well. I have to admit I have ne we watched Parks and Recreation but I did add it to my Netflix to see if I would like it. There is this part in the book where she is talking about back in the day. I was like, OMG, I should get out my old pics! 😂
The eighties were a strange time for teenage fashion. We wore silk blouses and shoulder pads, neon earrings and jodhpur pants. Come to think of it, our pants were especially weird. We also wore stirrup pants, parachute pants, and velvet knickers. It was a real experimental pant time. We curled our hair and sprayed it until it was crunchy and high. We wore jewel tones and too much makeup. With the exception of a few naturally beautiful girls who knew how to balance all of these elements, we looked ridiculous.
Overall, I enjoyed the book! Mel ❤️!121!Inspired me to continue on watching Parks & Rec!Very much enjoyed this, and I loved how Amy brought in others to help voice some sections of the book.!121!HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AUDIOBOOK! Amy Poehler is so genuine and awesome! On the audiobook she has special guests, a live audience for the final chapter, lots of random conversation, and all sorts of extra awesomness! LOVED THIS! :D!121!Improv queen, comedy player, actress and all-round 'cool person' Amy Poehler's entry into the now to be expected, shared memoir whilst still at, or near the top of one's game. Does one have to like or know Amy to appreciate this seemingly at times extremely honest and personal, as well as darkly funny book? Well my answer is a big fat no, unlike, in my opinion many of the politically left preaching comics Amy is not only very funny, she is talented and a great storyteller.On top of what I wrote above, this is a great book because Amy worked her way to the top, and is a proponent and advocate of working hard to achieve what you seek; she doesn't preach, she just questions the 21st century ideology that 'stars are found'; she feels that in (her) reality successful (and sometimes contented) people are those that have strived, sacrificed and worked really hard for a long time to reach their goals/get where they want to be. There's also a chapter on Parks and Recreation where I first found Amy, which wasn't even a highlight for me, because there just so many great and/or funny stories in this book, as well as real-talk deep moving ones. Thank you Amy! 8.5 out of 12.2021 read!121!Whelp, look for a flood of reviews coming in, cleaning out my bedroom/office before I go on the road for book tour! That also includes a lot of autobiographies I read as research/pleasure in the last year, preparing and writing my book that I need to add to Goodreads.I had to cut myself off from reading books in this category, actually, because I started getting intimidated and comparing my structure/writing to other peoples' autobiography structure/writing which only served to paralyze me and make me play video games instead of getting my own draft done. So I binged a lot of books the last few months in this category because my book is done and almost out and I can now lift the comparison stuff from my thoughts. Er. Kinda.Amy Poehler is a goddess to me, and since her company and my company are both owned by Legendary and we're in the same building, i always have this faint hope I'll see her and bump into her somewhere and be able to say, ""Hey, my company is near your company, we're company buddies!"" It hasn't happened. So this book is my conduit to her, and it is a pretty great one. Her life is amazing, and especially her love of improv is something I share, so reading about how she built UCB with such a cool community was inspiring. How she's stuck to her guns a lot, how she got help in the writing because things were so crazy, with friends doing guest chapters and stuff. I loved the variety and the pictures (although the one thing I will say that's negative is this book is HEAVY! It's printed on like 1000lb paper so if an intruder enters your home, look to this as a defense weapon.) Anyway, if you are interested in Amy then this is a book worth getting. Also: Her hair is entirely on point in the cover. Jelly.!121![As Will Ferrell impersonating James Lipton:] ""Amy, we remember seeing you in various things before you joined SNL in 2001. I'm sure this evoked the same feeling for our audience as most 90’s kids felt when Kenan joined the cast, though we were saddened to learn that he divorced Kel due to Kel’s orange soda addiction. You starred in such classics as Wet Hot American Summer, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigalow, and Citizen Kane. From the Upright Citizens Brigade to The Office Spinoff, your career has always been about various stages. Offscreen, you and your first wife Tina Fey have had two children together: Archie and Bunker.Now you've given birth to yet another child, a book baby.""I'll break character now to add my own thoughts about this book. Poehler's Yes Please is both a scrapbook of her life so far with plenty of pictures and advice, and oddly enough: time travel.Whether playing Hillary Clinton,Avril Lavigne,or Amber (who is hypoglycemic, has a mad case of bed bugs, yet still manages to rock one leg...),Amy kills it every time.Although I've seen glimpses of Amy through other cast members' books such as Rachel Dratch  and Tracy Morgan, I liked hearing the words right from Amy's mouth. Fine: ""fingers""; you know what I mean. Don't give me that look.I look forward to when this gets adapted into a movie called Mosquitos Love Me: A Woman's Guide to Getting Her Funk On: Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire, with Dakota Fanning in the lead role (Kate Winslet, Katy Perry, and Katie Couric all passed on the project). I will watch this on my eyelid screen and mind camera.In short, or ""long"" since this review is, I'll just say that this book had me giggling like Ron Swanson.Oh, and Amy: I'm so proud of you.Signed, your time-travel dad!121!I picked this up after having listened to Seriously... I'm Kidding on audio and feeling in the mood for something similar to cheer me up while having that damned cold. Also known as: part-two-of-feeling-terrible-and-wanting-an-audiobook-to-cheer-me-up-when-I-don’t-have-the-energy-to-read-actual-words.I don’t why it took me so long to realize that listening to memoirs on audio is a genius move. It made me rethink a lot past choices of reading the book instead of listening to it… I feel like if I’d read Yes Please by myself, I wouldn’t have enjoyed it even one little bit.But while I loved how the way the audiobook was constructed, I can't ignore that I didn't care for the contents of this book. Amy Poehler is, of course, extremely privileged in numerous aspects, and I knew this going into her writing. However, it continually exasperated me how in one essay the author would address her privilege, but then completely disregard it in the next while complaining about her #whitepeopleproblems. I feel like she's the definition of a White Feminist™ and/ or problematic fave. Not my fave, but still. I'd really recommend reading this incredible article that takes the time to discuss the ways white feminists are hurting feminism.That's not to say that all the essays in Yes Please were bad--a number (two) of them weren't... mostly because they weren't focused on Amy Poelher. They rest just came off as extremely pretentious and high-key offensive (I feel like she genuinely believes that white people experience racism........they don't).So I'd like to talk about the essays that made me think for awhile there that this book was going to go places:
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry:
By far, this was one of the most raw essays I read in this book. In Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Poehler takes the time to discuss taking responsibility for past mistakes made. I was left truly speechless upon finishing it.The funny thing is, before reaching this part, I was thinking of putting the book down; I wasn't feeling that invested in it. At the last minute something compelled me to put on the audiobook while waiting for a movie to load... long story long, that movie was forgotten about for a couple of hours.Not going to lie, I loved getting to read about Amy Poehler owning up to her ignorance and mistakes in this essay. Even more so for the fact that instead of putting the focus on herself, she lifted up the voices of those she hurt and gave them the platform to discuss and be heard in this book read by thousands and thousands.I particularly loved this next part that was taken from an email Anastasia Somoza, one of the kindest souls I've read about, sent in response to Amy's apology about the offensive SNL skit:“That being said, Chris, Marianne, my family and I have worked tirelessly to make equal opportunity, the inclusion and positive portrayal of people with disabilities in society the norm rather than the exception. As such, I was upset more generally speaking, about the skit contributing to a severe lack of knowledge, awareness, understanding and empathy around disability. Too many people already fear, and are often disgusted or put off in other ways by disability and it saddened me to think of the impact the skit may have had in adding fuel to that fire.”Needless to say, Anastasia and Marianne completely shifted something inside of me. I'm eternally grateful that they were voiced in here.
Let’s Build a Park:
The one essay I was most exited about that talked about everything in regards to Parks and Recreation. Also, I’VE NEVER SMILED SO MUCH WHILE READING AN ESSAY BEFORE. I loved how you could truly feel the passion and appreciation Poehler has for her character, Leslie Knope, and everyone that worked on the show.I was also interested in finding out more about my favorite power couple: Donna Meagle and Tom Haverford. And I did, in moderation, but I still did.

If one thing, this made me realize a rewatch was in order. And maybe also picking up Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance very soon!

However, enjoying only two essays out of twenty-seven cannot save a whole book for me. To be frank, I'm still a bit let down because I went into this with an open mind, but was reminded time and again how astoundingly obtuse the author could be. I mean, how can you spend twenty something minutes talking about something as important as supporting nonprofits, and then turn around and spend the last valuable minutes of your book talking about why you hate your phone and social media and how hard it is to constantly be on in...... 

I'm thankfully quickly getting to forget everything that was said in this book, which is kind of a blessing in disguise at this point.Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate. If you're interested in buying Yes Please

This review and more can be found on my blog.!121!Disappointing! Poehler complains about how hard it is to write a book many times, which is annoying, but I can't see how it would be hard to write a bad book. It's so obvious she was forced to do this, it's written from a bad place and I felt that bad place the whole time I was reading it. Poehler basically links lazy (she frequently says ""I'll tell you about that later"" which means she doesn't know how to tell a story) and shallow (""I don't remember anything about SNL so I'm not going to write anything"") anecdotes with terrible filler. Her advice is painfully obvious. You would think with a title like Yes Please Poehler would make a statement of some sort. But I didn't really take anything away. She shoots off lists of details about people she's worked with in the most thoughtless, uninteresting way I could possibly imagine. I almost thought, ""are you mad at Tina Fey? Because she wrote so much about you, and you've done a half-assed job paying any respect to her.""I enjoyed Poehler's childhood stories, sometimes. (She goes on for like 10 pages about this one time her friend and her handcuffed each other in school one day.) And every so often, she reveals beautiful moments when she actually slows down and stops name-dropping and barfing on the pages. Those moments... watching the moon with her sons, ""time travel,"" and the occasionally perfectly plucked set of words to describe a scene, make the book bearable? Maybe not. I wanted so much more from this book. Amy Poehler told us she did not have time to write a book, and she clearly did not. Nobody should have made her.!121!A book by Amy Poehler? Yes, please.This was a little underwhelming, if I am totally honest. It had some funny moments, but didn't quite have the insight I was hoping for. I didn't walk away feeling like I had learned anything new about Amy Poehler, because she chose not to focus on stories of her background or comedy career so much as ditties on loving your flaws and the categories of books on divorce. That's fine, but left me kind of disappointed as I was more interested in learning more about how she formed UCB and got to SNL. I feel like life advice doled out in celebrity memoirs is more meaningful when it's paired with clearer images of how they found success. I love, love, love Amy Poehler and maybe my expectations were a little too high, but I thought the book was just okay. Probably a fun read for existing fans but nothing particularly earth stopping. Maybe I should've listened to Amy's advice?For what it's worth, it sounds like the audio book may have had more appeal, given that Amy herself reads the book and her narration is reportedly -- and unsurprisingly -- hysterical.!121!After having this on my shelf for like two years I finally got around to it and it was great! I just love Amy Poehler so much guys.I listened to the audiobook as recommended by most people (while flipping though the physical book for occasional pictures) and MAN would I say if you at all can access the audiobook, listen to that! Not only are there special guest speakers, but some parts have actual audio from the things she is talking about (like scenes from parks & rec)Amy just seems like a very funny, honest, open person and like someone you would want to be best friends with. She talked about a lot of hard things but didn't go too in depth into any of them, but enough to give perspective.Overall a pretty fantastic book by a pretty great lady that I would definitely recommend.!121!4 Stars 
""It takes years as a woman to unlearn what you have been taught to be sorry for. It takes years to find your voice and seize your real estate.""
I don't watch a lot of TV. Now before you roll your eyes, I'm not trying to earn hipster cred here before waxing poetic about the wonders of the written word...  I'm just busy. And at one point my Netflix subscription lapsed and it was a month before I noticed. So yeah, I don't watch a lot of TV. But, I do own all the 'Parks and Recreation' box sets and I could watch them over and over and over and over. (My friend circle casually refers to me as 'Leslie Knope' and I always laugh good-naturedly and try not to show how absurdly proud this makes me) SO, even though I never read memoirs and I knew very little about Poehler outside of Parks and Rec, I snagged a download of the audiobook and was pleasantly surprised by how fun and genuine this book is. First off, I highly recommend the audiobook. Poehler has a knack for storytelling and her laugh is infectious; she'll completely pull you in. She also pulls other big-names on stage as Patrick Stewart, Kathleen Turner, Seth Meyers, Carol Burnett, and Poehler's own parents take turns reading. It's obvious everyone was having fun and that they want the readers to join along. Instead of a linear narrative of her life so far, Poehler gives us snippets and tells stories like she's sharing coffee with a friend. She doesn't leave out her mistakes, struggles and apologies. And instead remains real Topics included drug usage, divorce, cheap living in NYC and post-partum depression. All were taken seriously while still being discussed with levity. But my absolute favorite thing is how acutely aware Poehler is of her own privilege. She's very blunt about the opportunities she receives, her loving family, safety and comfort. So instead, she uses her voice to raise up other women. Every single chapter was filled with stories a smart, powerful woman Poehler knows and how proud she was of them. This female friendship was incredibly refreshing to read, and this sort of positive change is reflected in her 'Smart Girls' campaign and work with WWO.Of course, some chapters are better than others, and there isn't really an ending. The book just sort of... stops? It felt a little abrupt and odd. There's also a few jokes that fall flat-- most notably the ones about how technology is making it more difficult for us to communicate. (Especially since I was using technology to listen?) Overall:An authentic and funny memoir; with enough girl-power I'm sure Leslie would be proud.!121!4.5 StarsI listened to this on audiobook, as I now will choose to do when reading memoirs or autobiographies, and this was a VERY enjoyable experience. The audiobook I got from my library is narrated by Amy, and it was such a joy to listen to her deliver these jokes and discuss her life. This was very lighthearted and informational while also delivering a lot of advice, which I thought balanced out nicely. It didn’t read like a book that she wrote just because she knew it would sell— you could tell she put her heart into this and had her readers in mind, whereas I’ve read some memoirs from YouTubers and celebrities that just read like they’re only doing it for another paycheck. This book was genuine and felt like I had a friend telling me about her life, which is another reason why I like listening to memoirs on audio.She had a lot of guests in her audiobook narration, and it was very interesting because at some points, she and that other person would be in the recording studio together, and they would talk to each other casually. I don’t know if this is in the physical format of the book—I’m guessing not, because all the jokes were about being in the recording booth—but it was such a candid and hilarious edition to the book that just highlighted the fact that I felt like I was listening to Amy making a podcast about her life, complete with commentary from her friends.I definitely liked the last half of this book more than the first half, just because I don’t watch SNL or know much about improv, so I didn’t connect to it as much. However, I did really enjoy the sections where she talked about her family, or when her parents narrated their sections. Although I #cantrelate to having kids or having gone through a divorce, it was touching to hear Amy discuss these more intimate details of her life, and it was somehow fitting in a story that also delivered comedy. But since my purpose for reading this was because I love Parks & Rec so much, I really enjoyed the parts where she spoke about the cast. The little insights, backstories, and information about the actors was really fascinating. Particularly, the section where they go over the alternate last names they almost gave Leslie was hilarious, especially since they were both laughing really candidly. I would caution that this book does spoil a little bit of Parks & Rec, especially seasons 5 and 6. Sometimes, it actually plays audio clips from the show, which is awesome if you’ve seen it, you know what it’s talking about, and are eager to learn some of the behind the scenes about it, but if you haven’t watched it and don’t want to be spoiled, then definitely finish the show first.The last chapter is actually a recording of her reading her book live in front of an audience, which was by far the funniest chapter of the book to me because hearing the audience laugh at her jokes and the way that her delivery would shift in reaction to the audience was so much fun. I would highly recommend listening to the audiobook just for that experience.This genuinely feels like it went by three times quickly than it actually was, and I listened to this on 1x speed. It was addicting. I love Amy, I love her life, I love her jokes, and I love her show Parks & Rec. Read this if you love Leslie Knope. That’s all.!121!I think the world of Amy Poehler, but Yes Please was a No Please for me. I listened to it on audiobook which is narrated by Poehler. I love it when an author narrates their audiobook.I encourage Goodreads readers to read the many reviews on this book. Many rate it highly. For me, it rambled too much.!121!Once a woman turns 40 she has to start dealing with two things: younger men telling her they are proud of her and older men letting her know they would have sex with her. Both of these things are supposed to be compliments but can often end up making this particular woman angry. I don't think a man who is 15 years younger than me should tell me he is proud of me unless he is my sober coach or my time-travel dad. Older men can be sexy and powerful, but when a thrice-divorced entertainment attorney puts his bony hand on my knee, I want to whisper in his ear, ""You're crazy, old man.""I did not expect to like this book. One, I am no fan girl of Poehler's. I have never seen Parks and Recreation. Actually, I'm pretty sure the only thing I've seen her in is Mean Girls.However, the book surprised me. When Poehler is good, she is really, really good.THE GOOD1.) Feminism.I don't like it when bratty, privileged old white guys speak to me like I am their mouthy niece. I got that amazing feeling you get when you know you're going to lose it in the best, most self-righteous way. I just leaned back and yelled, ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU."" Then I chased him as he tried to get away from me.""You rich motherfucker! Who do you think you are? You're not better than me. Fuck you and your fucking opinions, you piece of shit.""*Carmen is impressed* This sounds like a more energetic version of myself. It also makes me REALLY like Poehler.She is against plastic surgery and Botox. She laments the shit that comes with girls dating in high school.Dating in high school was very different. Boys suddenly went up your shirt. Girls were expected to give blow jobs and be sexy. You had to be hot but not a slut. You had to be into sex but never have it, except when your boyfriend wanted it. If you had sex you had to keep it a secret but also be very good at it, except not too good, because this better be your first time.She really tears into mom-on-mom hate.There is an unspoken pact that women are supposed to follow. I am supposed to act like I constantly feel guilty about being away from my kids. (I don't. I love my job.) Mothers who stay at home are supposed to pretend they are bored and wish they were doing more corporate things. (They don't. They love their job.) If we all stick to the plan there will be less blood in the streets.Poehler is a fierce and outspoken feminist, I like it. The best parts of the book, in my opinion, is her standing up for herself (even though it's hard!) and not taking shit from people.""Relax"" is a real tough one for me. Another tough one is ""smile."" ""Smile"" doesn't really work either. Telling me to relax or smile when I'm angry is like bringing a birthday cake into an ape sanctuary. You're just asking to get your nose and genitals bitten off.2.) Aging.This is what adults do. They demand or deny drugs on their own terms.She also ties feminism in with aging. She talks a lot about how aging makes you better, more confident, stronger, and less likely to put up with shit.""Yeesh, she's a handful."" Luckily, that doesn't bother me the way it used to. That kind of feeling would have been hard to hold in my heart and stomach when I was in my twenties. It was hard to feel like somebody didn't like me. It felt like such a failure. I don't care as much now. It's really great. It's like I can finally eat spicy food without the gut ache later, or something similar. I have a stomach for people not stomaching me. Or at least I am working on it.She thinks one should embrace aging rather than try desperately to fight it.You know those exercise pools where the water comes at you strong and you have to swim against it to build up your strength? That's what the social pressure of staying young feels like. You can either exhaust yourself thrashing against it or turn around and let the pressure of it massage out your kinks. Fighting aging is like the War on Drugs. It's expensive, does more harm than good, and has been proven to never end.3.) Sex.Okay, Poehler's sex advice to women and her sex advice to men is SO GOOD that I really want to frame it and hang it on my wall. So true and so good. This section is amazing.Here are some highlights:I think sex is great. I love it and I am here to say I am good at it. ... Try not to fake it... remember to allow yourself real pleasure and not worry about how long it takes.... Don't have sex with people you don't want to have sex with. Remember that no matter how old you are, every time you see that person the first thing you will think of is, ""I had sex with you."" ... Don't get undressed and start pointing out your flaws or apologizing for things you think are wrong with your body. Men don't notice or care. They are about to get laid! They are so psyched... Get better at dirty talk. Act like a bossy lady ordering at a deli. ""I want the ham on rye and make sure you toast it!"" If your guy is bad at dirty talk tell him to shut up. He might like that. ... Don't make fun of men. Don't be mean to them or hurt their feelings. Try not to crush their dreams or their balls.Her advice for men is on point, as well.We don't want to remember your penis. We want to remember everything else but hopefully your penis is a just a wonderful blur of goodness. ... Keep it sexy. Don't believe what you see in movies. ... Cool it on the porn and jerking off. We think porn is great and so is jerking off, but if we are going to have sex it may cause some problems. If you depend too heavily on the technical or the visual then you may not notice the real flesh-and-blood person in your bed.I actually think Poehler PERFECTLY captures the line of a woman who likes and enjoys and uses porn, but STILL recognizes its dangers and how it can become a problem, and what the warning signs of it becoming a problem are. She talks about this quite a bit in the book and it made me happy. Her and I are in complete agreement about yet another thing!!!!Be nice, tell your woman she is hot, never shame her, and never hurt her.Work on your dirty talk... avoid the words 'climax, moist, and mom."" Don't speak in a fake accent. Or blaccent.If you don't get an erection, we know it's usually not because of us. We look concerned because we are wondering if it will keep happening.Stay away from orgies. They just take so much organizing and I feel like your time could be better spent.IF YOU DON'T EAT PUSSY, KEEP WALKING.Seriously, her sex chapter is succinct, to the point, and one of the most amazing sex advice chapters I have ever read. Serious props to Poehler here.4.) DivorceDivorce is another thing that Poehler gets exactly right. Her discussion of divorce is also one of the funniest parts in the whole book.She doesn't talk about her divorce specifically, I don't want to talk about my divorce because it is too sad and too personal. I also don't like people knowing my shit. which is completely valid.Instead, she talks about divorce in general and she nails it.Here are some highlights:This book will point to ways you can talk about your divorce without feeling like it's a fancy fur coat that people like to try on but then throw back at you in disgust because they would never wear something so vile....Chapters include:- Divorce is not an option for me, but I am happy for you- C'mon, who hasn't cheated?- I just couldn't do that to my kids- Maybe you guys just need to go to Ojai for a weekend....You will find tips on how to gently break it to women that you don't want to fuck their flabby baby-faced husbands.LOL LOL LOL It's so accurate and so funny. 5.) Beautiful bookAnother pro to this book is its beautiful layout. Poehler has spared no expense: she has printed her memoir on this soft, glossy paper - in order to better showcase photos. It's in full color and it is fabulous.She also breaks the book up with huge colored pages with quotes on them and huge pictures of her in costume.It's great. And (although I'm not telling you to buy it) I have to note that the book is only (in paperback) $16.99. I honestly expected it to be more expensive than that. So that is a plus.6.) She loves her children and it really shines through the whole book.7.) Poehler talks about one time she really fucked up. This is an amazing and hard-hitting chapter. She really goes into some self-exploration and she doesn't let herself off the hook. She really puts it all out there and it is touching, relatable, and brave. This is one of the best chapters in the book. Definitely worth reading.THE BAD:Alright. But the book isn't all awesome kickass feminism and witty wisdom. The book has plenty of flaws. Let's discuss them.1.) I don't care.She talks a lot about stuff I simply don't care about. There are chapters in here, chapters and chapters, where I just don't give a fuck. Her chapter on Parks and Recreation. Her chapter on her sleep apnea. The chapter she had Seth Meyers write. Completely pointless. (Then again, I have no idea who Seth Meyers is.) I didn't care about the SNL stuff, but she sounds SO joyous and grateful and fun in her SNL chapter that I can't file it under the bad section. Kudos to her for this section. Even I was having fun reading it, and I don't give a fuck.The whole story about her fake jokey birthing plans is worthless. Perhaps this is the danger of any memoir or autobiography. *shrug*2.) She tends to start stories, veer off wildly, and then weirdly finish up at the end of a chapter. She does this two or three times, and it's very annoying. She'll start a story at the beginning of a chapter, meander along around with completely different points, and then end the story at the end of the chapter.The stories aren't even that good, and even if they WERE, I would find it hard to still care by the end of the chapter.3.) Sometimes I could literally not understand what Poehler was saying. She has some really bizarre paragraphs in this book. Most of the stuff that I couldn't grasp was at the beginning.Woodsworth also said that the best part of a person's life is ""his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love."" I look forward to reading a book one day in which someone lists mine. I feel like I may have failed to do so.I don't understand anything about this or what she is trying to say here.It's called Yes Please because it is the constant struggle and often the right answer. Can we figure out what we want, ask for it, and stop talking? Yes please. Is being vulnerable a power position? Yes please. Am I allowed to take up space? Yes please. Would you like to be left alone? Yes please.This makes no fucking sense to me.I also don't get when she calls people ""open-faced sandwiches."" I get that she's using it as a compliment, but I have NO idea what it means or what it implies about someone. Maybe it's an in-joke from a sketch or a show? I have no idea.THE UGLY:Poehler seems to genuinely believe she is an unattractive person.I had already made a decision early on that I would be a plain girl with tons of personality, and accepting it made everything a lot easier. If you are lucky, there is a moment in your life when you have some say as to what your currency is going to be. I decided early on it was not going to be my looks. I have spent a lifetime coming to terms with this idea and I would say I am about 15 to 20 percent there.She talks about being 'plain' a lot. Which is sad. She's not plain, she is vibrant and beautiful, but she obviously thinks she is not 'a pretty girl.'My plain face was a perfect canvas for other people.I wanted to tell her to stop this. I wanted to tell her she is fucking gorgeous. I want to kill those fuckers who made her feel 'less than.'Boys, who were going through their own battles started to point out things about me I hadn't yet noticed. One told me I looked like frog. Some told me I smiled like a Muppet. A senior told me to stop looking at him with my ""big, weird eyes."" I looked in the mirror at my flat chest and my freckles and heard a sound.Also, she really, truly believes that every woman hates their body and thinks they are ugly. And that every woman has a 'demon voice' inside her which berates her and will never go away.The good news is there are ways to make it stop talking. The bad news is it never goes away. If you are lucky, you can live a life where the demon is generally forgotten, relegated to a back shelf in a closet next to your old field hockey equipment.And she acts like you can never get rid of it and that it will be constantly demanding your attention for the rest of your life.Maybe a day comes when you are getting dressed for a fancy event and it whispers, ""You aren't pretty,"" and you go, ""I know, I know, now let me find my earrings."" Sometimes you say, ""Demon, I promise you I will let you remind me of my ugliness, but right now I am am having hot sex so I will check in later.""I just don't agree with this reality. Hmmmmm, I know what she is saying but I just don't agree with it. It may be a sad fact for a lot of people, but I don't think this is inescapable and incurable. Perhaps I'm naive. Anyway, this whole section made me very sad.Tl;dr - Wow. I was surprised by how awesome this book was. You have to realize I am not a Poehler fan (this doesn't mean I dislike her, I'm just unfamiliar with her work). My close friend IRL read this and she said it was ""meh."" So I came into this with pretty low expectations.And for the most part, Poehler blew me away. Her fierce and determined feminism really speaks to me. Her chapter on sex and her chapter on divorce were on point. Her very honest and heartwrenching chapter on one time that she really fucked up was touching and human.But the book isn't perfect. I really debated on whether to give this a four or a five, and I had to end up giving it a four.Still, this is a book worth reading and I'm glad I read it. It's not very laugh-out-loud funny - I laughed more reading Anna Kendrick's book Scrappy Little Nobody, but Poehler makes up for it in sheer awesomeness.!121!Sweet read! True metaphors for the fame-inclined abound, & the author (as early as page four) becomes one of the best friends you never had! Poehler does three things at once-- she gives you insight into her personal life... the Wikipedia stuff and then some; she becomes retrospective about it, comes from a place where she can pinpoint exact successes & failures in her rad career; AND she entertains you throughout like only a true performer can.She professes: ""The talking about the thing isn't the thing. The doing of the thing is the thing."" So, really, don't let me tell you about it...!121!Another fun read from the subgenre I like to call, ""Memoirs written by women who worked on SNL"". It's overall a fun and humourous read. It may have needed some editing and could have lost a couple chapters but as a whole it's a memorable memoir. It's fun and that's all it needed to be.!121!People are their most beautiful when they are laughing, crying, dancing, playing, telling the truth, and being chased in a fun way.
Oh Amy, you are truly beautiful.I just adore her on Parks and Rec - there's just a certain something about such a positive, upbeat comedy that completely draws me in. This book had a similar feel to it. The tone is so down-to-earth that I felt like more we were having a chat over coffee rather than I was reading her book. She drops these pearls of wisdom with such subtle skill that I hardly noticed until I had a moment to reflect.
How a person treats their waitress is a great indication of their character.
I thoroughly enjoyed the behind-the-scenes peek at how the show got off its feet. Some of the SNL (and Upright Citizen's Brigade) bits went over my head but they were still fun to learn about. Amy describes it with her signature humor which makes it all the more enjoyable.I hadn't heard of the SNL skit about  Dakota Fanning & the disabled barbie prior to this book. Amy went through with the skit, though she did not fully know it's background. Turns out, the Barbie was based on a real life girl. And Amy made fun of her on live TV - and what's worse, the girl was watching that night.  And what does Amy do? After a few years of running and ducking, she owns up to it, in a major way. She had the cojones to publicly call attention to a horrible thing she did, that has long been swept under the rug. Why? Cause she knew it was awful and she shouldn't have tried to ignore it for so long.In short, a fabulous book to read. Highly recommended for both the comedic timing and the great advice.
That is the motto women should constantly repeat over and over again. Good for her! Not for me.
Audiobook Comments--SHE ROCKED THE NARRATION OF HER OWN BOOK - In a word, superb.--SHE HAD GUEST SPEAKERS - Amy had a great rapport with the others. The little chit-chat she did with each guest sounded so off the cuff and genuine. --She even had a few A-listers stop in for a few lines (hellooooo Patrick Stewart!!).YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!Not knowing 'at all' what to expect, I listened to the audiobook on my overdrive app from the library. I fall asleep too early to watch SNL. I didn't watch the Emmy's. I never heard of Parks and Recreation. The only movie I saw Amy in was ""Baby Mama"". ... But I did see The Golden Globes when she and Tina Fey were the hosts. I had zero expectations about ""Yes, Please"". I remembered a few reviews when the book 1st came out. Many of her fans were disappointed, yet a few people enjoyed it, if my memory is correct. Me...I enjoyed the audiobook a lot! I'm sure I could not possibly have enjoyed the book as much as listening to Amy read it! (Amy inserted many 'add-libs') Other guests including her mom & dad joined in to read, giving us their perspectives. These were some of the most touching moments. A big part of the enjoyment was the feeling of 'being with Amy'....and getting to know her. If Amy read the phone book - I think she could have held my attention. Random Thoughts & Feelings: (in no particular order)....Amy has heart! She really 'is' that girl you'd love to be best friends with. I adore her energy... her outlook on life. Amy is funny. She is also tender, compassionate, deeply appreciates her life. She express joy - is aware -values family- friends- working hard - honesty- forgiveness - and love. It was fascinating to learn more about her dealings at SNL. I loved hearing more about when she was 8.5 months pregnant during one of the most memorable political years in history. I had tears in my eyes when she shared about the mistake she made associated with the handicap - people she hurt - how she handled it wrong - ( how it ate at her - still - a year later)... She included in this conversation 'our ego'... and the role it plays - often making it soooo hard to forgive. Amy shared how she attempted to clean up the hurt she contributed to another A YEAR LATER... The entire story was fucking inspiring! I can't imagine a person not being able to relate to that story - in some form in their own life. My tears were from my own past sorrows. AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERN ....AMY deserved 5 stars for her book for that one story alone!!!Another 'teary' moving moment. ( later in the tape... different but sooooo beautiful!!!)Amy talked about HER BIRTH ... That's right .. 'The day she was born'. It was clever - funny- contributing with advice suggestions, and mostly it was a touching- inspiring moment when we got to witness how much Amy loved her parents -- and how much her parents loved her. When her mom and dad talked - I was 'mush'. Amy's parents gave some of the best 'advice' messages about marriage I've ever heard ... I loved it. ""TV is OK in the bedroom, dinners don't matter that much if they are on the table each night, ... but always love and respect your spouse ..never take cheap stabs"". ... etc etc etc. I can't remember now all that they said. Paul wants to hear this audiobook, so I may hear parts of this this again. Amy is vulnerable- brave - inspiring- with a rocking personality . She talked about her sleep disorder, her years with drugs. I laughed when she said was going to lie to her kids about how much she did. If they listen to her audiobook one day - like the rest of the world....guess that lie won't stand. lolAmy talked about sex .. ( great advice for men and women), she talked about creeps, and unhealthy boundaries, she talked about growing up, her neighborhood, working in an ice cream restaurant ...'singing happy birthday', tipping ( TIP HIGH...I agree!), doing service, she covered many issues we all care about.. all emotions were all the table.She gave great advice when she talked about the difference of living your life from passion verses being attached to the results we manifest. A B- is OK in her book. ( I love that attitude). She talked about protecting your own heart. ... not having to 'save' others ...'fix' their problems...( she admits all easier said than done), but protect yourself too. You never have to share embarrassing moments or anything you don't feel like sharing to people ""who don't have your heart""! ( amen, Amy!).......and Amy was always acknowledging other people. I think I loved that quality about Amy best of all. She's real..and a ball of loving fun! Hell yeah, I'd love to be friends with Amy Poehler! Ya can't convince me this book was a disappointment... it wasn't for this girl!!121!I LOVE Amy Poehler. This book just highlighted my favorite parts about her and also showed me some of her faults, which she owned up to. She just seems like such a genuine and down to earth person and I love it.I also highly recommend the audio book! I read the first half with the physical book and then changed to the audio book version and it made the entire experience so much better. Her voice is so soothing and you can tell when she's being sarcastic (it's sometimes hard to tell in the physical book).!121!Amy Poehler is an American actress, comedian, and writer. She gained television fame as a cast member on 'Saturday Night Live' and is probably best know for her role as Leslie Knope on the sitcom 'Parks and Recreation.' Amy Poehler on Saturday Night LiveAmy Poehler starred in the hilarious Parks and Recreation I listened to the audio version of this memoir, narrated by the author. The audio book also has 'cameos' from a handful of celebrities and dialog with Amy's family, friends, and colleagues. Thus there are snippets from Patrick Stewart, Carol Burnett, and Kathleen Turner as well as contributions from Seth Meyers (from Saturday Night Live), Michael Schur (showrunner of Parks and Recreation), and Amy's mom and dad. All this adds to the charm and humor of the book. Amy talks about growing up in a Boston suburb (she demonstrates her original Boston accent - which is way earthier than that of of John F. Kennedy) and how she became interested in acting and improv as a youngster. Amy's first foray into improv was in grade school when she played Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz' and did 'a bit' with the dog who played Toto. Little Amy PoehlerAmy Poehler in high schoolAmy's rise to fame required a lot of hard work and practice/training with improv groups while she made rent by waiting tables. During these times Amy sometimes lived in shabby apartments in scary neighborhoods but she makes it all sound rather fun. Amy also notes that she met a lot of now famous comedians/actors during this time, some of whom became good friends and colleagues. The book is not a linear narration of Amy's life and achievements. It skips back and forth in time and is a conglomeration of many subjects including autobiographical sketches from Amy's youth; anecdotes about 'Saturday Night Live' - including the Hillary Clinton impersonations; chat about helping to create the Upright Citizen's Brigade Improv Theater; talk about 'Parks and Recreation' - with a humorous tribute to each cast member; and a chapter about attending Boston College.Amy Poehler graduated from Boston CollegeAmy Poehler with the Upright Citizen's Brigade Improv TheaterAmy Poehler as Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night LiveAmy Poehler and the real Hillary ClintonAmy includes a section about assisting in Haiti after a deadly hurricane; confessions about teen drinking; a mention of the sadness caused by her divorce from Will Arnett; snippets about pregnancy, motherhood and her sons; and a chapter about her sleep problems.Amy Poehler and Will ArnettAmy Poehler and her sonsAmy adds fun descriptions of award show skits performed with an array of comedy actresses; how she enjoyed (finally) winning an award ('getting the pudding'); a self-assessment of her appearance; and much more. Through it all Amy comes across as a personable gal with plenty of talent, drive, and ambition. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey Amy Poehler and Kristen WiigAmy's rise to fame wasn't all sweetness and light however. Along the way she had to deal with manipulative producers and difficult people - and Amy makes it clear she's no pushover. Get on her wrong side and she'll let you have it! This is a side of Amy I didn't anticipate, but quite admire. An important lesson in the book - perhaps aimed at aspiring performers - is not to expect overnight success. Some parts of the book are laugh out loud funny, some are moving and insightful, and some drag along. Overall, however, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to readers who enjoy celebrity memoirs.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....!121!4/5 stars - I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. I didn’t know very much about Amy Poehler prior to reading this book, but I recently became hooked on Parks and Rec and wanted to learn more about the person behind my beloved character, Leslie Knope. I am so glad I did! This book is full of humor, lists, jokes, and even commentary from some special guests. The audiobook was nice because it allowed the listener to hear the various celebrities read their specific parts (including Seth Myers).My only criticism is that there were several parts of the book where I felt Amy could have been less guarded, but at the same time, I respect her decision to keep parts of her life private. Also when I read this book, I had only made it through season 4 of Parks and Rec, and sadly without warning some exciting news that happens later in the show was spoiled for me by this book when Amy lists of in quick succession things that happened to her character on the show. I wish there had been a warning at the beginning of that chapter and I would have gladly skipped it until I was finished watching all seasons. I learned a lot of interesting things about Amy’s childhood, her parents, and how she got started as a comedian. I appreciated her humor and candor throughout. Overall the book left with me with a great sense of the type of good-natured person Amy seems to be. I recommend reading this book, and if you have the opportunity listen to the audiobook, because the commentary and celebrity guests make it worth it.!121!I am probably not the only one who has a girl crush on Amy Poehler. She's funny, she's smart, she's sassy and she does good work. But I hope my future best friend will forgive me when I say her book is less than great. ""Yes Please"" is a fun little memoir about Amy's childhood, how she got her start in comedy, and some good behind-the-scenes stories, but overall, it's scattered and not very deep. She briefly discusses her marriage and divorce to actor Will Arnett, but the focus is primarily on her career. My favorite chapters were about her years at ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Parks and Recreation,"" which is a favorite show of mine.Early on, Amy discusses how difficult it was to write a book, and that she had to work on it when she had a few spare moments between jobs and taking care of her two children. It definitely felt like it was worked on it bits and pieces; it was not cohesive and some of the chapters even felt like filler. I listened to this on audio, performed by Amy Poehler and several of her entertainment friends, including Seth Meyers, Carol Burnett, Mike Schur, Kathleen Turner, Patrick Stewart, and also some cameos by Amy's parents. I think I liked the book more on audio than I would have in print (similar to when I listened to Tina Fey perform her book ""Bossypants,"" which was much more enjoyable than reading it). There were a few good quotes about friendship and show business and trusting yourself, and if I ever get a print copy from the library, I will revise this review and add those lines.I think I would only recommend this book to serious Amy Poehler fans; some celebrity memoirs have deeper themes and can resonate with a wider audience, but I don't think this is one of those books. (Sorry, Amy. Can we still be BFFs?)My rating: 2.5 stars rounded up to 3!121!3.5 Stars!I ended up doing audio on Yes Please and I thought it was fun and entertaining. I definitely chuckled in a few spots and enjoyed Amy Poehler’s takes on encouraging women to be their authentic selves and her distrust in technology. Girl, I feel the same on technology!I like Amy Poehler more after listening to this. She’s funny, intelligent and doesn’t apologize for being herself, bossy and a bit brash. I want to be friends with her now!I loved the 80’s references, her time on Saturday Night Live and how she got involved in improv comedy. Her comments on self-empowerment were also great to listen too.I would highly suggest the audio format on Yes Please.I just think Amy Poehler did an excellent job of narrating her own story. I felt like we were sitting down for tea and just chatting. It was a wonderful time of conversation and thoughts.Recommended to fans of memoirs, Saturday Night Live and humor!!121!Yes Please, Amy PoehlerYes Please is a 2014 book by American actress and television writer Amy Poehler. In Amy Poehler’s first book, she offers up a big juicy stew of personal stories. The book is a collection of essays about Amy's life written in a humorous way.تاریخ نخستین خوانش به زبان اصلی: روز هشتم ماه فوریه سال 2019 میلادیعنوان: بله، لطفا: هر چه می‌خواهی بگو، هر کاری می‌خواهی بکن، هر چیزی هستی باش؛ نویسنده: ایمی پوهلر (پولر)؛ مترجم شهناز کمیلی‌زاده؛ تهران نشر سنگ‏‫، ‏‫1398؛ در 288ص؛ شابک 9786229582732؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21م‬‬اِیمی مردیث پولر (متولد روز شانزدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 1971میلادی) بازیگر، تهیه‌ کننده، کمدین، صداگذار و نویسنده آمریکایی هستند.؛ ایشان متولد شهر نیوتون، ماساچوست بوده و در بوستون کالج تحصیل کرده‌ است.؛ این کتاب نخستین اثر نگارشی ایشان است.؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Comedy', 'Autobiography']"
The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales (Paperback),Oliver Sacks,4.06,220094,1985,"In his most extraordinary book, Oliver Sacks recounts the stories of patients lost in the bizarre, apparently inescapable world of neurological disorders. These are case studies of people who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people or common objects; whose limbs have become alien; who are afflicted and yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents. In Dr Sacks' splendid and sympathetic telling, each tale is a unique and deeply human study of life struggling against incredible adversity.","It's rare that I read non-fiction. It's just not my bag.That said, this is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. I'm guessing I've brought it up hundreds of times in conversation.It's written by a neurologist who works with people who have stranger-than-usual brain issues. And not only are the cases interesting, but the way he writes about the people invovled is really lovely. It's not clinical at all. Not judgemental. It's very... loving, I would say. It's interesting to see someone who obviously knows a lot of hard-line science write about these cases in terms that seem to me more suited to someone who would be a philosopher or a spiritualist.Amazing book. Can't recommend it highly enough...!121!Dear Dr. Sacks, On page 112 of the paperback edition of your book, the second paragraph begins with the following sentence:""And with this, no feeling that he has lost feeling (for the feeling he has lost), no feeling that he has lost the depth, that unfathomable, mysterious, myriad-levelled depth which somehow defines identity or reality.""I've read this sentence at least twelve times, and I still don't even have the slightest inkling of what the hell it means. What is the subject? What is the verb? Why is the word ""that"" italicized (twice?)? Good God man, what are you trying to tell me?Sincerely,Baffled in BrooklynSome people may think ""well, if I read the whole chapter, I'm sure I could decipher the meaning."" To those people I say: good luck, Charlie. I hope you may succeed where I have so miserably failed. This book has many fascinating studies of neurological disorders, and the stories behind the patients are easily understood and, in many cases, enthralling. However, Dr. Sacks seems to give his readers too much credit when he throws off ""hyperagnosia"", ""Korsokovian"", and ""meningioma"" like he assumes we had read an entire neurology textbook before picking this one up. Also, many of his sentences (like the example above) include so many digressions and sudden turns that each one could practically be its own M. Night Shaymalan film pitch. All of this might have to do with the fact that it was written in the eighties, when I presume people were smarter.!121!Despite so many people recommending this book, my high expectations were disappointed. Yes, it's perversely interesting to hear about neurological conundrums that afflict people in peculiar ways, but Sacks isn't a particularly good writer, nor does he have a good grasp on his audience. At times he obliquely refers to medical syndromes or footnotes other neurologists, as if he is writing for a technical physician audience, but on the whole his stories are too simplistic to engage such an audience. He talks about phenomenology, but doesn't satisfactorily discuss mechanistically what is going on in the brain, so what's the point? To quote a friend in college, it's his own ""mental masterbation""--he likes to show off how well-read he his, how many bizarre patients have been referred to him (or he's God's gift to them) and erudite his vocabulary is, but fails to clearly get his points across. On top of his confusing musings, his reconstructed dialogue is incredible unrealistic, it's clear why doctors need to learn to communicate better.!121!كيف يمكن لإنسانٍ أن يخسر هويته ولا يدري خسارتهكيف يتحول معنى الهوية بروحه إلى لا معنى،،إلى لاشئ؟في هذا الكتاب تتعلم من جديد إحترام الإنسانية فجنون أدب العبث ولامنطقيته يتجسد هنا في نماذج حقيقة لبشرٍ يفتشون عن بقاياهم المتناثرة في الكون العابث بهم والمنتظر لردود أفعالهم التي تأتي مذهلة وغير متوقعةهنا نتعلم معانٍ جديدة لكلمتيمأســـاة و نضـــالهنا يتجلى الوجع الإنساني وغرائبه وضياعه الفلسفي المتجسد في أمراضٍ عصبية عجيبة ومثيرة للدهشةكلنا هذا الكائن المسكين الضائع في الكون الضخم والباحث عن هويته عن معنى وجوده ،، نحن نحاول دوماً أن نحيا،، أن نجد للحياة المعنى ، والمغزى أن نتحدى الجنون المتلاعب بنا دوماًقد ننجح ،، وقد نخلق جنوناً جديداً رداً على كل العبث السائدلن تكون القراءة الأخيرة لساكس فهو طبيب وإنسان شغوف وممتليء بإحترام الإنسانية!121!This book contains case studies written in a philosophical way by a British Neurologist, Oliver Sacks. You will be bewildered at times while reading this book if you are not a Doctor as the author throws you into the fanatical world of complicated medical jargon bolt out of the blue. If you can tolerate this minor snag, you are in for a treat here. Even though the author tells us about difficult health conditions that people had to suffer, which might be painful for some people to read, the author's extraordinary writing style will keep us glued to it. This book is a must-read one for everyone who loves to read medical non-fiction.

 “‘Dangerously well’— what an irony is this: it expresses precisely the doubleness, the paradox, of feeling ‘too well’”!121!This is an utterly fascinating book, a collection of case studies by neurologist Oliver Sacks, presented in an eminently readable style. These studies deal with the most extraordinary mental conditions, often arising from damage to the brain, from the title case where a man in full charge of his faculties is unable to identify the purpose of any object (thus his mistaking his wife for a hat) to individuals who, again otherwise wholly reasonable, will deny ownership of one of their limbs.This isn't presented as a freak show. Each person is shown as an individual demanding our respect and sympathy. The over-arching message is how little we understand ourselves and how both revealing and bizarre it is when the machinery of the mind breaks down.An enthralling, humbling read that will make you think in ways you have never thought before.

Sacks chose the title of the book from the case study of one of his patients which he names ""Dr. P"" that has visual agnosia, a neurological condition that leaves him unable to recognize even familiar faces and objects.

Ci ha preso gusto anche Adelphi che verificato il successo, adesso s’impegna a tradurre e pubblicare con un lasso di tempo inferiore rispetto a prima: il libro è uscito in inglese nel 1985 e in italiano nel 1986.E io ci ho preso gusto con lui: dopo Risvegli, ho proseguito con questo, e più avanti ho letto anche Vedere voci e Su una gamba sola. Poi, come spesso mi succede, alla scorpacciata faccio seguire un lungo digiuno, che a volte dura per sempre.Sacks continua sulla falsariga del libro precedente, racconta casi clinici: lo fa con ironia, lo fa con empatia, con sensibilità. E oltre l’aspetto umano della malattia, dei confini che impone, del dolore che genera, da bravo medico (neurologo) non trascura l’aspetto scientifico.In questo mix perfettamente riuscito consiste la sua peculiarità, il suo talento e la sua genialità.Che, essendo composta per larga fetta da umanità e sensibilità, non solo suffragata da conoscenza medica, ha spesso spinto la comunità dei suoi colleghi a guardarlo con sospetto e scarsa simpatia.Il libro è diviso in quattro sezioni il cui titolo è piuttosto esplicativo: Perdite, Eccessi, Trasporti, Il mondo dei semplici.Le storie sono immersioni in particolari sindromi e disfunzioni, vedi Tourette, Korsakov, Conard, le atassie, agnosie, afasie, amnesie…La prima storia è proprio quella che intitola la raccolta e racconta del dottor P., un musicista che non riusciva a dare un significato visivo alle cose (prosopagnosia), scambia oggetti e persone, fino a confondere la testa di sua moglie per il suo cappello, e quindi cercare di prenderla in mano (staccandola) per mettersela (metterselo, visto che lui credeva fosse un cappello) sulla sua propria testa.Il deficit, cioè la perdita, di P. non era ottica, visiva: in lui scompare la capacità di assegnare un significato alle cose che vede, pur riuscendo attraverso gli altri quattro sensi a riconoscerle. Si veda l’esempio del guanto, che P. descrive ma non capisce a cosa serva finché non lo indossa e quindi tramite il senso del tatto riesce ad associare oggetto e funzione. Nella sezione Eccessi spicca Ray dai mille tic. I tic di Ray sono quelli della sindrome di Tourette, quella portata al cinema, secondo me in maniera egregia, da Edward Norton nel suo adattamento del romanzo Motherless Brooklyn. I farmaci placano i tic, ma rendono Ray troppo assopito, poco vivo: il dott Sacks decide di sospenderglieli. Meglio tic e vitalità che uno zombie.Oliver Sacks: Londra, 9 luglio 1933 – New York, 30 agosto 2015.!121!When I had come across the title of the book on Goodreads, I had mistakenly assumed to it to be a humour novel. But, when I finally found the book during one of my book hunts, I learnt that it is a non-fiction book where the author, a neurologist as well as a gifted writer, has presented some fascinating case studies about his patients with unique afflictions.The book has been divided into 4 parts wherein each section contains the case studies pertaining to a particular category of neurological afflictions.Medical case studies are written in a dry, clinical language where the patient is dehumanized, and reduced to a  cursory phrase . In the preface the author says,  “Such [medical case] histories are a form of natural history – but they tell us nothing about the individual and his history; they convey nothing of the person, and the experience of the person, as he faces, and struggles to survive, his disease.”  Thus, the author has attempted to  “deepen the case history to a narrative or tale”  and I liked the way he has talked about his patients with warmth, sympathy and respect.The narratives are often enriched with quotes, theories and experiences of other doctors, some of whom were stalwarts in their fields. There is a reference to Anton Chekhov as well.I believe most of us understand what a magnificent and complex entity the human brain is, and the book reinforced the fact that how fragile it can be – a little bit of damage and it can turn a person’s life upside down, make it difficult or even impossible for the individual to do even some basic functions which are so mundane that we do not even think about them. In the pages of the book, I came across afflictions I wouldn’t have imagined possible even in my weirdest dreams. A gifted music teacher suffering from “visual agnosia” had indeed mistaken his wife’s hand for a hat, and provided the title of the book; a woman would learn to use her hands at the age of 60 and prove herself to be a gifted sculptor; a man had the problem of leaning like the Tower of Pisa without his knowledge and would come up with his own novel solution and the list goes on. In some cases the patients would learn to cope, but in others they would not be so lucky. What a coincidence that I had just read Forrest Gump, the story of a fictional “idiot savant” before coming across real life idiot savants in the pages of this book.One particular comment by the author –  “The power of music, narrative and drama is of the greatest practical and theoretical importance” , pleasantly surprised me. I wouldn’t have expected this from a doctor, but maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised because the author did show his preference for a humane (for the lack of a better word) treatment of the patients.One problem you might encounter while reading the book is that the narrative is full of medical jargon. Thanks to the internet, we can find out the meanings much effortlessly compared to a dictionary, but if you read a real book, like I did and always do, then you need to put in the effort to type the words in your browser a lot of times. But, you know what, even if you do not check out every single jargon, you can till understand the fact of the matter.I understand that everybody might not like this book. But, if my review has piqued your interest, then I would urge you to at least check out the Goodreads page of the book.I just came across the list of : 100 books everyone should read by Amazon, and guess what! This book is included in the list.!121!5★“He also appeared to have decided that the examination was over and started to look around for his hat. He reached out his hand and took hold of his wife’s head, tried to lift it off, to put it on. He had apparently mistaken his wife for a hat! His wife looked as if she was used to such things.”This is such a classic that all I can do is share some stories. Oliver Sacks was the much-loved, highly regarded neurologist who opened up the world of the mind and brain not only to doctors but also to the public. The well-known movie, ‘Awakenings’, where he was played by Robin Williams, was based on his successful treatment of catatonic patients (including Leonard, played by Robert De Niro), ‘frozen’ for decades after being afflicted with encephalitis. Sacks’s perception and inspiration led to the trial which ‘awakened’ them, and he continued to use his remarkable insight and warmth until he died in August 2015.This book is a collection of cases of people with various brain anomalies, some caused by accidents or illness and some conditions present at birth. It is disconcerting today to read some of the accepted references to patients in 1985: retardates, defectives, idiots, morons, simpletons. ‘The Man’ of the title piece, lost not only the ability to recognise faces, he didn’t even know what a face was. When he tried to put his shoe and sock back on after a medical test, he picked up his foot and asked if that was his shoe. His wife was seated next to him, and he reached across and pulled on her head when looking for his hat. He was almost like a blind man, guessing what and where things were by feel, smell, taste. Yet he still functioned as a music school teacher and sang or hummed his way through his daily life to keep himself on some sort of track.Other cases include phantom limbs (gone but still painful), limbs that are perceived as foreign (it’s somebody else’s leg in my bed, doctor, and when I try to throw it out, I end up on the floor), and a woman who had completely lost her proprioception – which is our sense of where our body is in space (a common failing of drunks, but not to this extent). We know how to pick up our foot and move it forward. She had to concentrate every second on where her body was and what she needed to do or she folded up and collapsed. Couldn’t sit or stand without actively thinking about it. Another woman’s case is worth sharing, it’s so unusual:
“She has totally lost the idea of ‘left’, with regard to both the world and her own body. Sometimes she complains that her portions are too small, but this is because she only eats from the right half of the plate—it does not occur to her that it has a left half as well. Sometimes, she will put on lipstick, and make up the right half of her face, leaving the left half completely neglected: it is almost impossible to treat these things, because her attention cannot be drawn to them (‘hemi-inattention’—see Battersby 1956) and she has no conception that they are wrong. She knows it intellectually, and can understand, and laugh; but it is impossible for her to know it directly.. . . Knowing it intellectually, knowing it inferentially, she has worked out strategies for dealing with her imperception. She cannot look left, directly, she cannot turn left, so what she does is to turn right—and right through a circle. Thus she requested, and was given, a rotating wheelchair. And now if she cannot find something which she knows should be there, she swivels to the right, through a circle, until it comes into view.. . . If her portions seem too small, she will swivel to the right, keeping her eyes to the right, until the previously missed half now comes into view; she will eat this, or rather half of this, and feel less hungry than before. But if she is still hungry, or if she thinks on the matter, and realizes that she may have perceived only half of the missing half, she will make a second rotation . . . ”
 and so on. Incredible, isn’t it?Tourette’s, Parkinson’s, Syphilis, Epilepsy, so very many conditions that cause brain malfunctions. The last part of the book deals with retardation and autism and how Sacks discovered that many people who were considered to be without any intelligence actually did have views of the world --it just couldn’t be measured. He says testing measures deficits. It doesn’t allow for the human, as opposed to the neurological, vision of a person. It reminds me of the saying: Don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.Sacks says although our brain is computer-like, it is also personal and involves judging and feeling. Without that, our brains actually do become defective, and we can’t understand what is real and concrete, like ‘The Man’. He obviously can’t really interpret the world except the part he understands through music. And that still makes sense to him. But Sacks watched ‘hopeless cases’ carefully, figured out what they reacted to when he spent time with them, and had the insight (and, dare I say, patience) to interact with them. They drew for him, played games, expressed themselves in their own way, and enjoyed his company. One simple, clumsy girl who couldn’t learn but who loved listening to her grandmother read stories, also loved being outside. He approached her in the park one day, and she gave him a huge smile, gestured, and then called out single words: 
“spring, birth, growing, stirring, coming to life, seasons, everything in its time.”
 Sacks realised she did have her own very clear, poetic, perception of the world after all.Regarding the people who seem to have unexplained abilities with numbers and calendars but who cannot perform on tests, he understands that they may see the world in numbers (as we see it perhaps in pictures or sounds). In 1966, he met a pair of severely impaired young twin men who always sat together giggling and calling out long numbers to teach other. They could also tell you any calendar date, but they didn’t seem able to ‘do’ mathematics. Sacks started writing down their numbers, checked them, and discovered they were all, without exception, prime numbers (like 3 or 5, divisible only by 1 or by themselves, for those of you unfamiliar with primes.) But these were several digits long. So he got out his chart, sat with them one day, and then called out a prime number that was one digit longer than theirs. They were stunned! Sat and thought about it, smiled, and started calling out numbers the same length (7 and 8 digits). They eventually outstripped him (12 digits!), but Sacks had no way of checking anything more than 10. They ended up with 20 digits, which he had to assume were also prime. He quotes the mathematician Wim Klein, speaking about himself:
 “‘Numbers are friends for me, more or less. It doesn’t mean the same for you, does it—3,844? For you it’s just a three and an eight and a four and a four. But I say, ‘Hi! 62 squared.’”
I don’t know how much has changed in the thinking since this book was written, but I quite like his idea that we all respond to order and patterns, and while most of us respond in similar ways to similar things, some people need to have music to order their activities (‘The Man’ could function as long as he sang or hummed), some need numbers, some need nature. Given the right conditions, many people who were previously cast aside could enjoy life more on their own terms. He does caution about what we would now call ‘mainstreaming’ people (to make them more like ‘us’). The number twins were separated to give them a better chance to live a normal life, which they did to some extent (catching public transport, etc.), but the joy seemed to disappear. What kind of price is that to pay to meet our standards instead of their own?“One is reminded somewhat of the treatment meted out to Nadia— an autistic child with a phenomenal gift for drawing . . . Nadia too was subjected to a therapeutic regime ‘to find ways in which her potentialities in other directions could be maximized’. The net effect was that she started talking—and stopped drawing. Nigel Dennis comments: ‘We are left with a genius who has had her genius removed, leaving nothing behind but a general defectiveness.’ ”It's a fascinating glimpse into a fascinating field of study. It’s scary to think how many people we’ve passed judgement on over the years who could have been freer to enjoy life if we’d figured out how to enable them.I’m looking forward to reading some of his newer work to see where it took him and whether or not we’re doing a better job of understanding the immense variation of the human condition today.P.S. Another GR reviewer, Barbara, has done a nice job of summarising some of the cases in her review. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...This is a terrific ""Washington Post"" article from June 2023 about some surprising successes that have come from his work. https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellne...!121!نوشتم و بغض به گلوم چنگ زد. نوشتم و گریه کردم. نوشتم و بیخیال نوشتن شدم. اما این بار میخوام بنویسم. از چیزهایی که آدم ها به سادگی ازشون رد میشن و متوجه نیستن چطور دنیای کسی رو به هم میریزن. با جملاتی که از نظر خودشون عادی هست، اما قابلیت این رو داره تا آدمی رو طرد کنن. جوری که مثل بعضی از شخصیت های داستایفسکی، تنها بمونن و بیشتر وقتشون رو تو کنج اتاقشون صرف کنن. کی گفته تایپ شخصیتی رو با یه سری سوال مزخرف، میشه مشخص کرد؟ آیا تا حالا از خودت پرسیدی شاید این منم که باعث شدم اون آدم درونگرا بشه؟ آره، منظورم خود تو هست. همین تویی که گاهی اوقات با افتادن کسی از خنده روده بر میشی. همین تویی که اگه رهگذر جلوییت آروم قدم برداره، کاسه صبرت لبریز میشه و با طعنه و چشم غره از کنارش رد میشی. همین تویی که اگه بهت تنه بزنن، کفری میشی و میگی چته؟ مگه جلو راهت رو نمیبینی؟‌ همین تویی که نمیدونی چطور میشه آدمی رو ویران کرد و نفهمید!اما من میخوام یکم بهت بفهمونم. به این امید که کمتر آدما رو از صفحه زندگی محو کنی!روزگاری یه تومور لعنتی جا خوش کرد تو سر عزیزترین آدم زندگیم. کسی که برام حکم بودن رو داشت، نه فقط زنده بودن. اما به تدریج ورق برگشت. شیره ی زندگی از وجود نازنینش مکیده شد. عملی که انجام داد نه تنها تومورش، بلکه اس و اساسش رو هم بیرون کشید. شاید به این خاطر هست که فکر میکنم، همیشه چیزهایی که از دست میدیم بیشتر از چیزهایی هستن که به دستشون میاریم. زندگی تمام چیزهایی که میتونه بهت بده رو جلوی چشمت میذاره و میگه خوب دیدیشون؟ حالا بتمرگ سر جات چون همونایی هم که داری، میتونم ازت بگیرم. و صد البته که گرفت، طوری که از به یاد آوردنش  هنوز هم واهمه دارم. بعد از اون عمل هیچی مثل سابق نشد. از دریچه ی نگاهش دیگه یک شقایق دیده نمیشد. همه چیز و همه کس دوبرابر بودن. دیگه نمیتونست کل شهر رو به تنهایی بگرده چون نیاز به همراه داشت. کسی که مراقبش باشه تا از پله ها نیفته و دستش رو موقع رد شدن از خیابون محکم بگیره. میتونستی تو چشم هاش به محض اینکه لحظه ای رهاش میکنی بخونی:Hold me like the night sky holds the moonWrap me in your arms like you doو چشم هات رو هاله ای از اشک پر کنه و تو دلت بگی متاسفم که یادم رفت دیگه مثل گذشته نیستی. یه آن چشمت بخوره به همون کلاهی که از سرش هیچوقت برنمیداره. و تو خوب میدونی که بخاطر سرما نیست. شاید بهتر باشه به خود کتاب رجوع کنم: ""حس میکنم بدنم نسبت به خودش کر و کور است... هیچ حسی از خودش ندارد"" این ها حرف های خود اوست. او هیچ واژه ای، هیچ واژه صریح و روشنی برای بیان این غریبی، این تاریکی (یا سکوت) حسی ندارد. تاریکی و سکوتی که شبیه به نابینایی یا ناشنوایی است. او واژه ای پیدا نمیکند، ما هم واژه ای پیدا نمیکنیم و جامعه هم واژه ای و همدلی‌ای برای این حالت ندارد. با نابینا دست کم با مراقبت و دلواپسی رفتار میشود؛ می‌توانیم حالت او را تصور کنیم و طبق آن رفتار کنیم، اما وقتی کریستینا با درد و ناشیانه سوار اتوبوس میشود چیزی جز پرخاش هایی خشم آلود نمی‌شنود:""خانم چه‌تان است؟ کورید؟ مستید؟"" چه جوابی میتواند بدهد که من ""گیرندگی حس عمقی ندارم؟"" فقدان حمایت و همدلی اجتماعی درد و رنجی است مضاعف: معلول است، ولی معلولیتش آشکار نیست. به هر حال او که نابینا یا فلج نیست، به طور آشکار مشکل ندارد، پس با او مثل یک متظاهر یا یک کودن برخورد میشود. آره. واژه ها حتی برای مایی که ادبیات رو شخم میزنیم هم ناکافین :) این کتاب برای من فقط یکسری کیس عجیب و نادری که به تور دکتر ساکس خوردن نبود. خود خود خود زندگی بود.دکتر ساکس عصب شناس به نظرم محشری بود که به بیمارهاش به چشم کالا نگاه نمیکرد. دغدغه مند بود و برای درمان نهایت تلاشش رو میکرد. اگرچه همیشه موفقیت آمیز نبود.کتاب شامل ۴ بخش هست. بخش اول به بیمارهایی می پردازه که چیزهایی رو از دست دادن. بخش دوم به کسایی اشاره میکنه که یه چی هم اضافی دارن. بخش سوم شامل کیس هایی هست که درکشون تغییر پیدا کرده. مثل داستایفسکی عزیزم که به گمونم در تمام کارهاش اگه اشاره نکرده باشه در اکثر آثارش یه شخصیتی هست که دچار صرع هست و معلوم نیست چیزی که میبینه تخیل و رویاست یا واقعیت. و در بخش چهارم به دنیایی می پردازه که از دید معلول های ذهنی روایت میشه.نویسنده اگرچه بعضی جاها تخصصی حرف زده اما اون بخش انسانی قضیه هم فراموش نکرده. جوری که موقع خوندنش این حس بهت دست نمیده که داری یه مقاله ی علمی میخونی. تو رو با چیزهایی مواجه میکنه که تو هیچ کتاب انگوزشی بهش نپرداختن! بهت نشون میده که چطور بیماری ای برای کسی موهبت بوده و برای دیگری رنج و عذاب. از چیزهایی میگه که در حالت عادی بهشون توجهی نمیکنی با اینکه نقش حیاتی ای دارن. از امید میگه و از ناامیدی. از تلخی و شیرینی. از کسی که بدنی براش نمونده و از آدمی که انگار روحش رو از دست داده. از کلی مسائل که نمیتونم تک تک نام ببرم و خودت باید بخونیشون.شاید اینطور تونستی خیلی چیزهایی که به سادگی ازشون میگذری رو درک کنی. یهو زیر لب بگی پس نکنه به این خاطر بود که فلانی همش زمین میخورد و میذاشتیم به حساب دست و پاچلفتی بودنش...آره خواننده ی صبورم که تا اینجا تحملم کردی. این دفعه دلت رو بذار پیش کسی که واژه ای برای شرح حالش وجود نداره. شاید با برخورد مهربانانه ت این احساس رو درش بوجود آوردی که زندگی میتونه کمی بهش آسون بگیره و انسانیت هنوز نمرده :)!121!Es un libro curioso y muy clarificador.

Despite the review blurbs stating that these are ""personal"" and ""touchingly human"" looks at neurological disorders, I saw only a few glimpses of this warmth (an example that springs to mind is the ""Returning To India"" story).I can't really pin down what I didn't like about the book, but reading it, I had the sense I was being whisked in and out of hospital rooms by a busy, clipboard-toting doctor...which wasn't the best feeling.!121!آلیور ساکس یک عصب‌شناس معروف است که خارج از حیطه‌ی کاری در زمینه‌ی موسیقی و ادبیات هم فعال بوده است. او پزشک مغز و اعصاب است و در این کتاب پیرامون بیماری برخی از افردا که عمدتا بیماری‌های عجیب و نادری دارند، نوشته است.تلاش و دید متفاوت او به بیماری آدم‌ها و داشتن نگاه مثبت و متفاوت او برای من خیلی جالب بود. نقطه‌ی عطف کتاب برای من جایی بود که او در سالی که به سرطان دچار شد و در مجله‌ی نیویورک تایمز این‌گونه نوشت:"" می‌خواهم تا جایی که می‌توانم به عمیق‌ترین، غنی‌ترین و مثمرثمرترین وجه زندگی کنم. می‌خواهم و امیدوارم که در این زمان باقی‌مانده دوستی‌هایم را عمیق‌تر سازم، با تمامی کسانی که دوستشان می‌دارم خداحافظی کنم، بیش‌تر بنویسم، و اگر قدرتی در من مانده باشد مسافرت کنم تا به درجات جدیدی از درک و بینش برسم.او به انسانیت در حرفه‌اش بیشتر از هرچیزی اهمیت می‌دهد.!121!In a Nutshell: Expected something very different. Learnt a lot. But didn’t enjoy this read. Might work better for those familiar with neurological terms. Acclaimed neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks has been called the ‘Poet Laureate of Medicine’ by the New York Times. This book, first published in 1985, is a collection of twenty-four of his most intriguing case histories, each dealing with a peculiar issue connected to neurological health. The book is divided in four parts: Losses – which deals with abilities or senses being ‘lost’, Excesses – exactly the opposite of the first section with unusual senses being ‘gained’, Transports – mental portals into another time/place while the body is here, and The World of the Simple – the neurological issues of the ‘simple-minded’. Ranging from a woman who could not feel her body, to twins who had a remarkable faculty for digits and nothing else, and of course, the titular man who mistook his wife for a hat, the cases are mind-boggling. If ever you need a book to make you realise the extent to which the nervous system impacts every factor of your being, this is the book to read. One of the epigraphs at the start is a quote by William Osler, saying ""To talk of diseases is a sort of Arabian Nights entertainment."" You can see that Dr. Sacks believes in this quote to the core. Every case reveals his fascination with the disorder/problem, with his tendency towards evaluating the indicators, studying them keeping known cases in mind, and providing a neurological opinion wherever possible. No matter how shocking the symptoms, the doctor’s approach remains neutral towards the patient but passionate about the neurological factors. His explanations involve terms that medical professionals or those interested/knowledgeable in the field would get completely. Why only three stars then?I am not from a medical background, nor am I much aware of neurological terminology beyond some common or popular concepts. As such, most of his explanation went above my head. After a point, I started skipping the explanation and read only the cases. More importantly, I couldn’t accept his level of apathy easily. Here I was, horrified at the symptoms displayed by the patient, and there he was, going gaga over the same. I could see why he felt excited about tackling a previously unknown neurological affliction, but c’mon! Those affected were regular humans, many of whose lives were messed up by their sickness. Show some hint of sorrow or regret for them! Surely being clinical doesn’t interfere with being humane. (Good thing I didn’t become a doctor like my dad had wanted me to! I would have been hopeless at staying placid next to the patient’s bedside! 😄)Also, honest confession: I thought it will be a funny book based on the title. To a certain extent, I was expecting something on the lines of books by Adam Kay or Rosemary Leonard, both of whom wrote relatively light-hearted experiences of their work. Both these were professionals who wrote for the general populace. This one, however, seems to have been written as a documentation of potential case studies for medical students or neurological professionals or anyone with a keen insight of the subject. Definitely not for lay people with not much medical knowhow. And definitely not humorous in the remotest sense of the word. In short, the cases are startling, no doubt in that. The writing style, not for me. Will work better for those who have a certain familiarity with the medical concepts and who don’t mind the eccentric bedside manner of the doctor who is more excited about the neurological aspects than bothered about the patients.3 stars, mainly for scaring me with what can go wrong with the brain.PS: I get that this book was written ages ago. But it has been in print all these years. So the vocabulary in the final section - 'The World of the Simple' - should have been updated to match contemporary standards. It is quite outdated, and borderline offensive. I wish those in charge of handling this book at present look into this. (My copy was published in 2021, so nothing edited till then at least.)———————————————Connect with me through:

Twitter!121!I've read a lot of popular science books in my time, and in one way or another they have always felt cut from same cloth. Similar language used, similar structure, drawing on the same inspirations. After a while it almost feels like you are reading the same book over and over again, with only slight variations in content.So The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat came as a complete breath of fresh air. A blast, in fact. Oliver Sacks has written a book rather unlike anything I've read before, both in its content and delivery, but also the way it acts as a meta-commentary on the field of science communication. The book is a collection of case studies from Sacks' career as a neurologist, each chapter focusing on a particular patient. The stories themselves are fascinating, ranging from the titular man who's vision is so neurologically impaired that he literally mistakes his wife for a hat, to the woman who lost all sense of proprioception - if she did not look at where her body was in space, she had no idea where it was. However the way that Sacks tells these stories was what gripped me. Quite apart from other popular science writers, he draws on a wide range of inspirations from poetry to philosophy to music to medical papers. The text is sumptuous. One gets the feeling of a writer who has lived a rich life, who has not been confined to one box of academia, and who allows his experiences to wash together in a melange of words on the page. I loved, loved, loved it.You could argue that Sacks actually makes a point about this in the final chapter, a neurological patient who is a brilliant artist but almost completely incapable of interpersonal communication. Reading this, at the very end of the book, I got the impression that Sacks was holding up the mirror to the way science was written about at the time, and still is to this day. Are you scientists not brilliant at abstract thought, gifted beyond measure in unpicking complex behaviour from a mass of data, yet totally incapable of connecting another human to that process? You spend so much time living in your box, in your world of abstraction, that you lack the necessary experience in being human, exposure to the humanities, to make a genuine connection to other people. Sacks demonstrates that if you allow the human to take centre stage, pushing the science to a supporting character, then communication, and wonder, will flow.Absolutely recommended. A real must-read.!121!Dr. Oliver SacksDr. Oliver Sacks was a physician, author, and neurology professor who published several books about people with neurological problems. In this book Dr. Sacks discusses patients whose brain malfunctions cause a variety of 'maladies' including: a musician who lost the ability to see faces or recognize familiar objects; a former sailor who believed the year was permanently 1945; a man who thought his leg belonged to someone else; and other unusual afflictions. To provide a feel for the book I'll just give a capsule description of the most interesting cases.THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HATDr. P was a talented musician and music teacher whose problems began when he lost the ability to see people's faces - though he could recognize them by their voices and movements. The problem worsened to the point where Dr. P mistakenly thought inanimate objects - like fire hydrants, parking meters, and furniture knobs - were humans.In time Dr. P could no longer identify everybody objects. For example, he thought his shoe was his foot and vice versa. Though Dr. P was not diagnosed, physicians speculate that he had a brain tumor or brain damage that caused 'agnosia' - ""the loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells.""The title of the story refers to the fact that - when looking for his hat one day - Dr. P mistook his wife for a hatrack, took hold of her head and tried to put it on. Luckily, Dr. P retained the ability to play and teach music, and was able to continue with his fulfilling career.🔷THE LOST MARINERIn 1975, Dr. Sacks saw Jimmie G - a 49-year-old man who left the Navy in 1965 after serving for more than two decades. Jimmie seemed confused about his current situation but was able to describe his school days and his experiences during and after WWII - which he talked about in the present tense.Dr. Sacks learned that - in Jimmie's mind - the year was perpetually 1945 and he was 19-years-old. Jimmie couldn't recall anything that post-dated 1945 and was unable to form ANY new memories. In fact, if Dr. Sacks walked out of the room and returned, Jimmie thought they were meeting for the first time.When shown a mirror, Jimmie was shocked at his 'old' appearance, and - though his brother was long-married with grandchildren - thought his sibling was a single man in accounting school.Apparently Jimmie was competent until he left the Navy, but by 1971 was totally disoriented - probably from alcohol abuse. It was determined that Jimmie suffered from amnesia due to 'Korsakov's Syndrome' - ""an amnestic disorder usually associated with prolonged ingestion of alcohol.""🔷THE DISEMBODIED LADYChristina was a bright, athletic 27-year-old computer programmer who worked from home. When health problems required the removal of her gall bladder, Christina was treated with prophylactic antibiotics prior to the operation. This was a common precaution, not expected to have any deleterious effects.Shortly before the surgery Christina had a dream in which she lost sensation in her hands and feet. A couple of days later Christina REALLY lost sensation in her entire body. Christina couldn't feel her arms, hands, legs, feet, etc. She couldn't walk, was unable to pick things up, and so on. Christina felt like her body was 'dead, not real, not hers.'Christina was diagnosed with inflammation of the nerves in her limbs. As a result, Christina lost her sense of 'proprioception' - ""the ability to sense the relative positions of body parts without looking at them or thinking about it."" It's unknown whether the prophylactic antibiotics caused this or not.Eventually, Christina learned to use her other senses - especially vision - to compensate for her loss of propioception. Christina had to consciously monitor and regulate every motion, making her movements difficult and clumsy. Nevertheless, Christina persevered and tried to live as normal a life as possible.🔷THE MAN WHO FELL OUT OF BEDDr. Sacks was called in to see a man who had been admitted to the hospital because of a problem with his leg. After falling asleep in the hospital, the patient woke up to find 'someone's leg in the bed', a severed human limb. The man was horrified, and concluded that a nurse had perpetrated a bizarre joke. The patient threw the leg out of bed, but he went with it, because the limb was attached to him.While Dr. Sacks was in the room, the patient began punching and tearing at his left leg. Dr. Sacks advised the man to stop, as he was injuring his own limb, but the patient refused to accept this.The man apparently had hemiplegia - ""paralysis on one side of the body"", probably caused by brain damage.🔷PHANTOMA 'phantom' is the sensation that a lost body part (usually an amputated limb) is still there.Dr. Sacks tells the story of a sailor who accidently cut off his right index finger, but couldn't dislodge the notion that the digit was still sticking out of his hand. For the next 40 years, the sailor was wary of bringing his damaged hand near his face - to eat or scratch his nose - because the finger might poke his eye out. The sailor knew this couldn't really happen, but was unable to make the feeling go away.The sailor was finally 'cured' when he lost sensation in ALL of his fingers due to diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). The phantom finger 'disappeared' with the rest of his digits.🔷TILTMr. Dunston, a 93-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, tilted to the side when walking - to the point he was in danger of falling over. However Mr. Dunston was unaware of the slant, and refused to believe he wasn't upright until Dr. Sacks filmed him in motion.Mr. Dunston, who had been a carpenter, attributed the problem to the loss of his inner 'spirit level' (an instrument used to determine whether a surface is perfectly horizontal or vertical).Mr. Dunston, being a clever fellow, rigged up a 'level' that could be attached to his eyeglasses - called 'spirit spectacles' - which he could use to correct his posture. The spirit spectacles became very popular with patients afflicted with Parkinson's disease.🔷EYES RIGHTAfter a massive stroke, Mrs. S - a woman in her sixties - lost the ability to see anything on the left side. If Mrs. S's dessert was on the left side of her tray, she couldn't see it; in fact Mrs. S couldn't even see the food on the left side of her plate. This 'left blindness' extended to everything, so that Mrs. S. would only make up the right side of her face, etc.To compensate, Mrs. S got a rotating wheelchair and swiveled in a circle until things came into view - a crafty solution to (some of) her problems.🔷CUPID'S DISEASENatasha, a 90-year-old woman, had begun feeling unusually 'frisky' at the age of 88 - giggling, telling jokes, and flirting with men.Natasha realized this was 'inappropriate', and - surmising she was physically ill - consulted a doctor. Natasha reported that, at age twenty, she had contracted 'Cupid's Disease' (syphilis) - which was treated, but apparently not eradicated.In fact Natasha WAS suffering from neurosyphilis - an infection of the brain and/or spinal cord caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. The bacteria were stimulating her cerebral cortex and affecting her behavior.Natasha didn't want to get end-stage syphilis, but didn't want to be cured either since she was enjoying her girlish feelings. So doctors gave Natasha penicillin to kill the microbes, but did nothing to repair her cerebral cortex - allowing the elderly woman to remain playful. (At 90 years old, why not. LOL)🔷REMINISCENCE Mrs. O'C - an 88-year-old Irishwoman living in an old age home in NY - was a little deaf but otherwise in good health. One night Mrs. O'C dreamed of her childhood in Ireland, complete with a woman singing Irish songs. When Mrs. O'C awoke, she still heard the Irish songs - very loud - and went to turn off the radio broadcasting the music. But there was no radio. Mrs. O'C then thought her dental fillings were picking up a broadcast, but this wasn't the case either. Finally, Mrs. O'C concluded something was wrong with her ears - and consulted a doctor.Mrs. O'C was eventually sent to a neurologist - Dr. Sacks - but had trouble hearing him through the music. Dr. Sacks determined that the songs were neurological, probably due to a stroke that caused seizures in Mrs. O'C's temporal lobe (a part of the brain that processes music). As Mrs. O'C recovered, the music faded away.🔷THE DOG BENEATH THE SKINStephen D. was a 22-year-old medical student who regularly used amphetamines, cocaine, and PCP. One night Stephen dreamed he was a dog, and woke up with a greatly heightened sense of smell.Stephen was able to distinguish all kinds of things by their 'aroma' including: friends, patients, streets, stores, sexual activity, foods, and so on. Unfortunately, unpleasant odors were stronger as well. Moreover, Stephen felt COMPELLED to sniff everything (like a pooch)....and had to be careful to avoid being inappropriate.After three weeks the enhanced sense of smell disappeared, and Stephen returned to normal. Years later, Dr. Sacks revealed that HE was Stephen D. (Naughty naughty)🔷THE WORLD OF THE SIMPLE**I have to insert a note here. To modern ears, some of the language used in this section is very disturbing. Talking about people who are mentally challenged, Dr. Sacks uses terms like: simple, simpleton, retardate, mental cripple, idiot, moron, and dullard. Granted, these essays were written before such terms became 'forbidden.' Still, the book has been re-released several times over the years, and these words could have been changed (IMO).**JOHN AND MICHAELJohn and Michael were 26-year-old twins who had been institutionalized since the age of seven. They had an IQ under 60, and were variously diagnosed as autistic, psychotic, or severely retarded.As happens with some autistic people, the twins were 'idiot savants' - ""mentally handicapped persons who display brilliance in a specific area, especially involving memory.""The twins had clear memories of ALL their experiences and had a 'calender program' in their heads so that - given any date, past or future - they could instantly pair it with a day of the week. The twins were also able to recall and repeat a long string of numbers (over 300 digits), explaining that they 'could see it.'Perhaps most remarkable of all, the twins made up a game in which they recited increasingly large prime numbers to each other, a feat that's almost impossible without a computer. In fact, Dr. Sacks - wanting to join the game - got a 'cheat book' of prime numbers. (Ha ha ha)Dr. Sacks waxes poetic about the twins, saying: ""The twins, though morons, hear the world's symphony, but hear it entirely in the form of numbers.""Eventually the twins were separated - 'for their own good' - which seems very sad to me.THE AUTIST ARTISTJosé was a mentally handicapped man whose epileptic seizures and (possible) autism became obvious when he was eight. At that time José's family confined him to the cellar, where he was isolated and deprived of stimulation for 15 years. Finally, at the age of 22, José 'blew up in a rage' and was hospitalized.In the hospital, José - now properly medicated - showed a remarkable talent for drawing. This was when Dr. Sacks met the patient. Dr. Sacks showed José his pocket watch and asked him to draw it. José studied the timepiece, then quickly and confidently drew a faithful facsimile, with creative flourishes. Dr. Sacks was impressed, thinking José had more mental agility than people thought.During a later visit, Dr. Sacks showed José an issue of 'Arizona Highways' magazine, which had a scene of people canoeing. José swiftly copied the canoe and canoers - making the people seem even more intense and alive than the original. To Dr. Sacks, this demonstrated José's powers of imagination and creativity.Then, when Dr. Sacks showed José an image of a rainbow trout, the patient drew a fish of his own - with an amusing roguish look, like a 'fish-person.' This showed not only imagination, but a sense of humor.Eventually, surrounded by caring doctors and staff, José began to blossom. He no longer accepted his deprived state, strived to recover speech and understanding, and began to draw for self-expression.🔷Dr. Sacks' case studies are interesting and informative, and - when originally published - shed light on afflictions that were not well understood at the time. Dr. Sacks' stories are still fascinating and I enjoyed reading them.I also applaud the fact that Dr. Sacks showed that mentally challenged individuals can have talents and abilities that rival those of mainstream society - which usually marginalizes these people. And I admire Dr. Sacks attempts to help his patients find happiness and meaning in their lives.That said, Dr. Sacks includes a LOT of philosophical musing in his stories, in an attempt to imbue neurological afflictions with some deeper meaning. In my opinion, illnesses (even brain malfunctions) are biological phenomena. Thus they have no abstract significance, and I found the 'philosophical' sections of the book boring and sometimes incomprehensible.I'd recommend the book to readers interested in neurology.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....!121!یکروز صبح از خواب بیدار شدم و هیچ چیز اتاق برام آشنا نبود. با وحشت روی تخت نشستم و دنبال یک نشونه آشنا روی در و دیوار گشتم. یادم نمیومد کی ام. اینجا کجاست و من وسط این اتاق چکار میکنم. حتی اسمم یادم نمیومد. بزرگترین وحشت زندگیم رو تجربه کردم. کسی اسمی رو صدا میکرد که اسم من نبود. مغزم خالی بود. هیچ نشونه آشنایی با این دنیا نداشتم. خالیه خالیه خالی بودم. تنها حسم وحشت بود و تهی بودن عمیق. حتی میترسیدم از اتاق بیرون برم و بگم چیزی یادم نمیاد. میترسیدم دیوونه شده باشم. چند دقیقه طول کشید تا یادم اومد کی ام. افتادم روی تخت و به شدت گریه کردم. اون چند دقیقه وحشتناک ترین لحظات زندگیم بودن. بخاطر همین وقتی دکتر ساکس توی کتابش میگه بی خاطرگی و فراموشی ترسناکترین اتفاق برای یک انسانه ، من باور میکنم......این کتاب رو با اشتیاق خوندم چون توی یه دوره رایگان روانشناسی عمومی که دانشگاه ییل گذاشته بود، دکتر پل بلوم پیشنهادش کرده بود و خب نوروساینس هم مبحث مورد علاقه منه.!121!الیور ساکس، نورولوژیست و استاد دانشگاه، توی این کتاب عجیب‌ترین کیس ها و بیمارانش رو معرفی کرده. بیمارانی که به علت آسیب‌های مغزی متفاوت، عارضه‌های متفاوتی رو از خودشون نشون دادن. مثلا مردی که همسرش رو با کلاه اشتباه می‌گیره، زنی که بدنش واسش بیگانه میشه و نسبت بهش هیچ احساس تعلقی نداره و کنترلی هم نسبت بهش نداره، مردی که پای خودش رو بیگانه تلقی میکنه و وقت خواب سعی میکنه اونو از تخت بیرون بندازه، مردی که به علت آسیب مغزی نه تنها نابینا میشه بلکه بعد از اون مفاهیم نور و دیدن هم واسش بیگانه میشن، زنی که در اثر سکته‌ی مغزی تمام مدت موسیقی محبوبش مثل کنسرت توی مغزش پخش میشه و همیشه صدای اونو میشنوه، کودک مبتلا به اوتیسمی که فقط از طریق نقاشی میتونه با دنیای پیرامونش ارتباط برقرار کنه و ...کیس های بسیار متفاوت و عجیبی توی این کتاب بررسی شده که خوندنش میتونه خیلی جالب باشه. اگه با نوروفیزیولوژی و بعضی از آسیب‌های مغزی آشنایی داشته باشید، لذت خوندنش دوچندان میشه.!121!Nu m-am amuzat deloc citind articolele lui Sacks. Nu e nimic de rîs aici, fiindcă nu ne găsim la teatru. Pacientul nu joacă un rol pe care îl poate părăsi oricînd vrea. Devine o marionetă aflată în slujba unei „forțe” care își bate joc de el (fără ca el să-și dea seama). Uneori, psihicul o ia razna. Omul își pierde mințile, cum se spune, și, odată cu ele, în unele cazuri, identitatea. Nimic mai trist decît un om care se crede altul (un personaj istoric) sau, pur și simplu, nu mai este în stare să spună cine / ce este (în Alzheimer). Am văzut astfel de oameni, i-am privit în ochi și n-am găsit acolo decît întuneric și suferință.Singurul lucru demn de a fi ținut minte și discutat amănunțit (ceea ce Oliver Sacks nu face) este încercarea autorului de a defini eul / sinele / self-ul altfel decît Locke, Hume și ceilalți gînditori care au meditat la asta. Dacă sinele unui individ oarecare divulgă identitatea lui, atunci cum ar trebui să definim această identitate? Răspunsul lui Oliver Sacks e cunoscut. Sinele este naratorul și protagonistul unei povești despre sine, pe care „biograful” o rescrie permanent. Este ceea ce criticii literari au numit o „autoficțiune”. Altfel spus: „Dacă vrem să cunoaștem un om, punem întrebarea: «Care e povestea lui, povestea lui adevărată, cea mai adîncă?» - pentru că fiecare dintre noi este o biografie, o poveste. Fiecare dintre noi este o narațiune singulară, construită continuu, inconștient, de noi, prin noi și în noi, prin percepțiile, senzațiile, gîndurile și acțiunile noastre; și, nu în ultimul rînd, prin discursul nostru, narațunile noastre vorbite. Sub raport biologic, fiziologic, nu sîntem atît de diferiți unii de altii; sub raport istoric, ca narațiuni, fiecare dintre noi e unic. Pentru a fi noi înșine, trebuie să ne avem pe noi înșine, să punem stăpînire, la nevoie să punem din nou stăpînire, pe poveștile vieților noastre. Trebuie să ne «adunăm», să adunăm drama interioară, narațiunea despre noi. Un om are nevoie de o asemenea narațiune, o narațiune interioară continuă, pentru a-și menține identitatea, sinele său”. Pornind de la acest fragment, m-am întrebat adeseori:Cînd sfîntul Augustin spunea „eu / ego”, la ce se referea mai precis? La „suflet” sau la „minte”? La ceva material sau imaterial? La ceva permanent sau temporar? Întrebarea poate fi repetată cu privire la sfîntul Thoma de Aquino sau Descartes? Încă n-am citit o istorie a reprezentărilor sinelui. Din păcate...!121!من أجمل ما قرأت في هذه السنة. لقد غيّر هذا الكتاب الكثير من المفاهيم الخاصة بالذاكرة عندي. كما تغيّرت عندي مفاهيم أخرى تتعلق بحالات الجنون والاكتئاب والحالات النفسية.هذا الكتاب ليس كتاباً طبياً، أو نفسياً، أو تجارياً. بل هو كتاب إنساني بالمقام الأول.هل تعرف قيمة ذاكرتك أيها الإنسان؟ هل تعرف قيمة حياتك بلا ذاكرة؟ بنصف ذاكرة؟ بربع ذاكرة؟ بذاكرة قديمة؟ هل تعرف لماذا يتصرف بعض الأشخاص أحياناً بصورة تجعلنا نظن بأنهم مجانين؟ وأخيراً.. هل تعرف كم فاتك إن لم تكن قرأت هذا الكتاب بعد؟!121!اگر مثل خود من علاقه مند به نورولوژی و نوروسایکولوژی هستید، اگر دلتون میخواد چند روزی در دنیای بیمارانی قدم بزنید که بعضی بیزار و بعضی خوشحال از بیماریشون هستند و میخواید بدونید چرا و اگر از همراه شدن با پزشکی که بیمارانش را ""می بیند"" کیف می کنید، این کتاب رو بخونید.!121!خواندنِ این حکایت ها دریچه هایی عجیب می گشاید(برای من که چنین بود و هست). دریچه هایی برای از نو دیدن. انگار بیدارت می کند برای به یادآوردن و دوباره در خود یافتن، یافتن چه چیز اما؟ یافتن انسان آیا؟ وقتی متوجه می شوی که زندگی و همه ی معیارهای آن ممکن است وهمی بیش نباشد! چه هولناک است پس ماهیتِ انسان! کتابِ عجیبی ست. نمی گویم خوب، نمی گویم خواندنی، کتابِ زندگی بهترین گزارش است درباره ی آن. آنهم در این روزهای هیاهو زده ی مسلول، ما آدم های عقرب گزیده ی متظاهر را چه چیز بهتر از بازخوانی ذهن و روان؟ نکند که ذهن و روان ِ خویش را کمر بسته ایم به ساختن دنیایی دروغین برای زیستِ نکبت زده ی خویش؟ چه می گذرد در ذهنِ انسان؟ ماجرا چیست؟ و این آن چیزی ست که در این کتاب یافته ام(کاملن شخصی شده و شاید بدونِ شرح برای دیگران. بنابراین پیشنهادش نمی کنم اگر خواهان نباشد کسی برای کنار زدن پرده ها. کتاب ممکن است حال را دگرگون کند، عجیب بشود پیرامون آدم از بس که می روی در کنکاشی درونی و شخصی). برداشت یکم) دی شیخ با چراغ همی گشت گِرد شهر – کز دیو و دد ملولم و انسانم آرزوست: آیا تعریفِ کسانی که گمان می برند کاملن سالم هستند درباره ی دیگرانی که آنها را بیمار روانی می دانند درست است؟ می شود وارونه نگاه کرد؟ می شود گفت این به ظاهر آدم ها سالم هستند که بیمارند؟ و راستی مگر یک نقص یا زیاده از اندازه داشتن را باید بیماری خواند؟ اصلن اگر دقیق تر بخواهم بگویم، می شود کلِ فرآیند وجودِ انسان را یک اشتباه بزرگ دانست؟ شاید هم بشود گفت اتفاق! و عجیب این جاست که همه ی بودن و نبودن و همه ی تعریف ها و حالت ها و احساس ها از یک جا سرچشمه دارند، از مغز! همه چیز! و پس از آن یک آسیب همه ی جهان تعریف شده ی انسانی را به شکلی دیگر نشان می دهد. راستی حقیقت چیست؟ و راستی مگر اصلن حقیقتی وجود دارد؟ اصلن می شود گفت کسی بیمارِ روانی است؟ کسی که مغزش آسیب دیده است! چه بسا که جهان او بی اندازه پاک و دلنشین تر باشد از ما دیگرانِ در ظاهر بی آسیب. یادآوری: مغز آسیب دیده است. خاطره ها پریده اند. زوال آمده است. دیگر هویتی وجود ندارد. هیچ کیفی ندارد هیچ چیز. انسان سقوط می کند در ورطه ای که نمی شود درکش کرد. آیا اینْ سرانجام، فرجامِ انسان نیست؟ فراموشی ابدی، نبود هویت، ناشناختگی و گاه بی خویشتنی محض. آنجا که حتا خدا را به آن راه نیست!برداشت دوم) اینجا برای از تو نوشتن هوا کم است – دنیا برای از تو نوشتن مرا کم است: در نگاه مردمِ عاقل تو دیوانه ای بیش نبودی! سودا زده ی بی خیالِ تمامِ شهر! ای بیچاره همه ی مردم شهر که ناآگاه بودند که این تنها تو هستی که جان به در برده ای از دیوانگی! تنها تو هستی که می دانی همه ی آن مردمانِ دیگرند که بی بهره اند از عقل! دلبستگانِ وابسته ی همیشه نگران! فلک زده های غرقْ در خوابِ همیشه گریان! گوشهاشان نشنود! که همه چیز حرام، چشم هاشان نبیند! که همه چیز عذاب، دهانشان نجنبد! که همه چیز کفاره ی گناهان! ای بیچاره مردم شهر که تو را دیوانه می پنداشتند که تنها تو بودی که دلت زلالِ بود شسته از همه نیرنگ ها! جهانِ تو اما ای کاش که می دانستم چگونه بود. که هرچه بود که هرچه هست تنها یادهاست! خاطره هاست. همه ی آن منظره ها و حس ها. جاده ها، کوچه ها، لرزش بطری آب را یادم می آید بر کناره ی پنجره ی قطار، چه می گذرد در ذهن در خیال؟ ای دوست داشتی ترین دیوانه ی تمام جهان. ای دیوانگی ارجمندِ عقلِ محض.برداشت سوم) سپاس از خانم فرهادیان که دست برده است به بازگرداندن این متن به پارسی؛ جز این که بهتر می بود اگر کمی از دراز نویسی فعل ها کم می شد(مشکلی که ما در همه ی نوشته هامان هست و حتا در گفتگوی روزانه مان) اگرچه به روان بودن متن آسیب نزده است. چاپِ نشرنو هم که حرف ندارد. خوش دست و سبک و حرفه ای.1398/03/05!121!This is not a series of medical case studies, but a series of philosophical musings on the human condition. Full Review to follow (in time)!121!I guess I'm just not smart enough to fully appreciate this book. But I do realize that an awful lot can go wrong with our brains, and when that should happen to me, I would be very lucky with such an empathetic and humane doctor. Yet, his writing is dry and clinical, which is a shame because there were really interesting cases. I enjoyed reading some parts of the book, but not enough to feel satisfied about reading this book. Especially the chapter ""The Visions of Hildegard"", in which he describes the hallucinatory visions of migrainous origin from a 12th century nun Hildegard from Bingen, made me wonder why this book is so popular.!121!The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a book about people with neurological disorders centred on issues with perception and understanding the world. The brain receives so much information each second, information we will never be consciously aware of. But what happens when the pathways start to break down? Weird and wonderful things evidently. Sacks reminisces over some truly bizarre case studies he encountered over his career. And, like the title suggests, one involves a man who mistook his wife for a hat in his inability to accurately perceive people and his utter confusion regarding objects. It’s amazing really how someone like that can get through life. The way they see the world, the way they experience the realities of the everyday, will be vastly different to what you and I see. For them though it is normal. They don’t know that their mode of reality completely alien to everybody else’s. When this was published Sacks addressed some rather odd disorders but now, over thirty years later, this book is less shocking as many of these conditions have been normalised to an extent. The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a mere curiosity, nothing more.!121!This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription “If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.” 🌟 I have been intrigued by this book’s title as soon as I first heard it. I thought it was a fiction book but then discovered that it is Non-fiction and I decided to read it this year as part of my challenge to read some non-fiction books.🌟 Then, I discovered that it was written by a neurologist and it features neurological disorders. I had a hate relationship with Neurology and its disorder in the first two years in medicine. I then decided that I had enough and that I want to understand it more. I went back to the basics, took Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience courses, aced them and I became yet another fan of neurology!!!🌟 The human brain is one of the most intriguing things ever and is also one of the biggest mysteries of the universe, and although our understanding of it is way better than decades ago, we still haven’t scratched the surface –at least for me-.🌟 The disorders this book includes are interesting as the man who mistook his wife for a hat literally, Phantom limbs in which people can feel pain and sensations in their amputated limbs, Seizures that made a man has super smelling, the twins who can’t do simple arithmetic but can tell you how many sticks are stacked together just by a simple glance and more!! Some of the cases were not very interesting but they were mostly short cases so it was OK!🌟 I can’t say Dr.Oliver is the greatest author because his writing is full of medical jargon and may be hard to understand for non-medical readers. He assumes that we have a good knowledge in many things as opposed to the book I am currently reading (Which discusses sleep and the language makes much more sense for all readers). Dr.Oliver’s language is like a text-book/ scientific language more befitting for teaching than a general book.🌟 Summary and Prescription: I have a long history with Neurology so this was a mini challenge for me to read. The language is not very easy (But still can be understood) for the general population. There are some really interesting cases here for anyone who is interested in the human brain and it’s disorders.I decided to give this one a 3.5 out of 5 stars!!121!Dry. Reading this book is like eating saltine crackers without anything to drink. He only briefly discusses the cases (these are, ahem, the interesting parts of the book) and then embarks on tedious philosophical discussions about neurology. He does seem very proud of himself and his education, though; I will give him that as a backhanded compliment.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Medicine', 'Neuroscience', 'Medical', 'Short Stories']"
How to Win Friends and Influence People (Paperback),Dale Carnegie,4.22,969884,1936,"You can go after the job you want...and get it! You can take the job you have...and improve it! You can take any situation you're in...and make it work for you!Since its release in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People has sold more than 30 million copies. Dale Carnegie's first book is a timeless bestseller, packed with rock-solid advice that has carried thousands of now famous people up the ladder of success in their business and personal lives.As relevant as ever before, Dale Carnegie's principles endure, and will help you achieve your maximum potential in the complex and competitive modern age.Learn the six ways to make people like you, the twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking, and the nine ways to change people without arousing resentment.","This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and ""win friends"" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It didn't matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they weren't redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I didn't really want and, because I was so preoccupied with ""winning"" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people. I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that's really just me trying to find something positive (using the ""principles"") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you'll only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.Thank you for reading this review.!121!Dale, saying people's names often when you're talking to them, Dale, doesn't make you popular, Dale, it makes you sound like a patronizing creep.This book is probably really handy when you're trying to befriend kindergarteners, not as much adults. It's also aimed at salespeople and not regular humans.!121!Three things about this book surprised me and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. One - it seemed pretty much timeless. Not much anachronism here, because language still serves the same purposes as ever, and people still want basically the same things they've always wanted. I liked the examples taken from Abe Lincoln, etc.Two - the techniques described in the book aren't duplicitous. We all try to do what the title says, just like everyone else, whether we're admitting it to ourselves or not. Readers are repeatedly encouraged to develop genuine interest in others, be honest and ethical, and obey the golden rule.Three - I enjoyed it (read twice back to back) and it felt easy and natural to apply some of the ideas in my life. Shortly after reading this book, I was a little bit better at communicating and a little bit happier about my interactions with others in general.!121!This is a sad book. A book that aims to turn us into manipulating individuals who would want to achieve their means through flattery and other verbal-mental tricks. Even technically, it seems to me that the ploys' in this book would never really work. Here is a quote from the book - “Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.” And what does the book do? It tries, or at least pretends to turn you into a someone who would flatter everything that moves – so that you get - WHAT YOU WANT. Most of us read so that we are inspired, moved, even shocked or atleast entertained by stories. We also read so that we understand better and stretch the possibilities of our minds and hearts, to be better human beings. We definitely do not read to become conniving ugly creatures to be held prisoners by our greed. And come on get a grip – this is essentially a sales book.!121!I bought this one in 2004 from an Amsterdam bookstore and it has been laying on my bookshelves since then. It's an icon of self help books and that was a problem because I kind of hate that genre. I decided to get rid of this one as well but not without trying, at least, to see if there is anything of value in it. Well, I was surprised to read some sensible advice and I decided to actually read more. charming in their archaic ways. So, the book wasn't total garbage. As I said above, it had some good advice about the subject of win friends and influence people although there was a lot of filler in order to make his principle into a book. Some examples were really interesting others a bit ridiculous. One of the problems I had with the author and one I find too often in self-help books is the condescending tone, the ones that tells you how smart he is and that she is the only one capable to tell you how success is achieved. It was an interesting read, I learn some useful skills but it isn't groundbreaking anymore in my opinion.!121!How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale CarnegieHow to Win Friends and Influence People is a self-help book written by Dale Carnegie, published in 1936. Over 15 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.

It is a total of 236 pages but the essence could be boiled down to 12 at most. Every chapter, he has one point summarized in a neat box at the end. I skimmed the rest. He gives you six examples when one or two would do. He deliberately repeats himself. He wastes the readers' time.Do yourself a favor and just read the ""In a Nutshell"" summary points at the end of each chapter. You won't miss anything.!121!When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
Dale Carnegie is a quintessentially American type. He is like George F. Babbitt come to life—except considerably smarter. And here he presents us with the Bible for the American secular religion: capitalism with a smile. In a series of short chapters, Carnegie lays out a philosophy of human interaction. The tenets of this philosophy are very simple. People are selfish, prideful, and sensitive creatures. To get along with people you need to direct your actions towards their egos. To make people like you, compliment them, talk in terms of their wants, make them feel important, smile big, and remember their name. If you want to persuade somebody, don’t argue, and never contradict them; instead, be friendly, emphasize the things you agree on, get them to do most of the talking, and let them take credit for every bright idea. The most common criticism lodged at this book is that it teaches manipulation, not genuine friendship. Well, I agree that this book doesn’t teach how to achieve genuine intimacy with people. A real friendship requires some self-expression, and self-expression is not part of Carnegie’s system. As another reviewer points out, if you use this mindset to try to get real friends, you’ll end up in highly unsatisfying relationships. Good friends aren't like difficult customers; they are people you can argue with and vent to, people who you don't have to impress. Nevertheless, I think it’s not accurate to say that Carnegie is teaching manipulation. Manipulation is when you get somebody to do something against their own interests; but Carnegie’s whole system is directed towards getting others to see that their self-interest is aligned with yours. This is what I meant by calling him the prophet of “capitalism with a smile,” since his philosophy is built on the notion that, most of the time, people can do business with each other that is mutually beneficial. He never advocates being duplicitous: “Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.” Maybe what puts people off is his somewhat cynical view of human nature. He sees people as inherently selfish creatures who are obsessed with their own wants; egotists with a fragile sense of self-esteem: “People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.” Well, maybe it's just because I am an American, but this conception of human nature feels quite accurate to me. Even the nicest people are absorbed with their own desires, troubles, and opinions. Indeed, the only reason that it’s easy to forget that other people are preoccupied with their own priorities is because we are so preoccupied with our own that it’s hard to imagine anyone thinks otherwise. The other day, for example, I ran into my neighbor, a wonderfully nice woman, who immediately proceeded to unload all her recent troubles on me while scarcely asking me a single question. This isn’t because she is bad or selfish, but because she’s human and wanted a listening ear. I don’t see anything wrong with it. In any case, I think this book is worth reading just for its historical value. As one of the first and most successful examples of the self-help genre, it is an illuminating document. Already in this book, we have what I call “Self-Help Miracle Stories”—you know, the stories about somebody applying the lessons from this book and achieving a complete life turnaround. Although the author always insists the stories are real, the effect is often comical: “Jim applied this lesson, and his customer was so happy he named his first-born son after him!” “Rebecca impressed her boss so much that he wrote her a check for one million dollars on the spot!” “Frank did such a good job at the meeting that one of his clients bought him a Ferrari, and another one offered him his daughter in marriage!” (These are only slight exaggerations.) Because of this book’s age, the writing is quaint and charming. Take, for example, this piece of advice on how to get the most out of the book: “Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.” A lively game! How utterly delightful.Probably this book would be far more effective if Carnegie included some exercises instead of focusing on anecdotes. But then again, it would be far less enjoyable reading in that case, since the anecdotes are told with such verve and pep (to quote Babbitt). And I think we could all use a little more pep in our lives.!121!It's considered corny to read books like this, but that kind of cynicism is ultimately limiting and counterproductive. My dad forced me to read this book and it was one of the main things that pushed me out of my shyness and made me an amicable person.!121!There's actually some really great advice here that sort of stands the test of time. But like most self-help books, a lot of the advice doesn't work in every situation and/or is just flat-out situational.  I also think the winning friends part of the book is less about having true friendships than about how to win over a room or how to convince people to see things your way. I wouldn't think that smiling and being agreeable, which is great on the surface and a good way to behave in general, would lend itself to creating strong intimate relationships. Everyone (whether they admit it or not) likes to see a bit of piss and vinegar in the personalities of their friends and lovers. My two favorite pieces of advice were these:Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. The author points out that when you humiliate someone their first instinct is to double down and try to prove that whatever they did or are doing is valid. It doesn't matter how right you are, the vast majority of people don't respond to criticism well at all. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.So true. Even if you win, you lose because that person will (once again) be humiliated and not be receptive to what you are trying to do. You may be completely right, but you're just shooting yourself in the dick by getting into an argument over things. You can smugly be right, or you can swallow that pride and choose to get things done. If you want results, try to put yourself in the other person's place and use a softer hand. No one likes to be embarrassed. Really the gist of everything this book talks about is just that you need to put yourself in the place of the person you need to win over. What do they want? <--probably recognition and compensation. What would they like to hear? <--praise over what they've done well will likely go a long way to smoothing over any hurt feeling when you discuss what you would like them to do differently. It also talks about giving sincere compliments and just being the sort of person who de-escalates bad situations. However, as most people already know, it's impossible (and sort of stupid) to be that person all the time or in every situation. Obviously, there will be times that you need to put your foot down and be firm about what you want. I think this book is just saying that you should try the nice way first. Now I listened to a revised version, so some of the situations presented were updated. I didn't realize this was what I had until Stevie Wonder and a computer company were both used as various examples for something or other. I was like...1930what?! I don't think so.I would love-love to read the original text in all of its (I'm sure) outdated glory, but I suppose that will have to wait for another day.I wasn't expecting to find this such a readable (listenable?) book, but I had no trouble getting through it at all. Andrew Macmillian - Narrator!121!Easy to understand advice for building and improving positive and successful relationships with people in all areas of your life. Not a book per se for making friends, although it certainly can be used that way (with a grain of salt perhaps), but more directly a book that promotes good communication, kindness, and the social skills to foster healthy and productive working relationships. I can see how some people are taken aback by Carnegie’s advice. You have to be in the right frame of mind to truly gain from this book. Go into it with a reflective approach and a genuine and concentrated effort to gain wisdom and you will be rewarded with the insights to achieve the goodwill of others as well as solid and lasting relationships.!121!:قبل أن تشرع في قراءة الكتاب, هناك ملاحظات أحبذ اعتبارها في حساباتك1- السلوكيات والنصائح الواردة لا يعتمد عليها بالكلية للحصول على أصدقاء من أقرانك, فلكي يقبلك أحدهم كصديق في علاقة طويلة المدى يجب أن تكون شخصاً ذا ثقل, ويحمل م��يزات مادية مفيدة تجعله يحتاجك دائماً, وإذا فقدت هذه الميزات فستنطفئ علاقته بك تدريجياً حتى وإن لم يكن يقصد هو ذلك؛ لذا فالعمل على تنمية مهاراتك هو حجر الأساس. 2- يجب أن تبدو السلوكيات التي تنفذها بمظهر السلوكيات المخلصة, فالناس لا يحبون الرياء والمداهنة؛ فذلك يظهرك غالباً كنصاب يعاملهم كأغبياء, وفي أحسن الأحوال تظهر بمظهر النصاب فقط, وفي كل الأحوال سيتلاشى مجهودك المبذول على هذه السلوكيات. وبصفتي الشخصية, لي صديق يحاول دائماً تنفيذ سلوكيات كالمذكورة في الكتاب كإظهار الاهتمام بما يثير اهتمامي, ولكنه لا يفعلها بإخلاص غالباً, فيتحول الأمر إلى مدعاة للشفقة. 3- السلوكيات الواردة ليست بتعاويذ سحرية, فضلاً عن أنها معروفة وقديمة قدم الأزل, ولكن لا يستخدمها الناس عادة في أمورهم اليومية لارتفاع تكلفة الجهد المبذول فيها مقابل العائد البسيط منها نظراً لأن معظم الأشخاص الذين نقابلهم لا فائدة منهم على الإطلاق. وعندما نحتاج أحد هذه السلوكيات لتخطي ورطة مع أحد الأشخاص, تتوه الحلول مننا, وإن وجدناها ف��يس بمقدورنا تنفيذ ما لم نتعود على فعله تنفيذاً يبدو جيداً. وعليه, فالأعلام الوارد ذكرهم في الكتاب كعباقرة في التعامل مع الناس مثل ""روزفلت"", يستثمرون جهود ضخمة لتمويل شعبيتهم وسط الناس, وبهذا أصل من جديد إلى إن العبقرية هي مقدرة على الصبر/الاجتهاد.ليس لدي الصبر على كل تلك المشاق لتلقي مشاعر الناس, ومن الجيد أنه ليس لدي رغبة عميقة في استزادة مقدرتي على معاملة الناس بحكم شخصيتي الـ""INTJ-T""  .. وعليه نويت استخدام الكتاب كمرجع, في حال إن تورطت في علاقة مع أحد البشر.4-""moral high ground fags"" ككل الكتب التي تتحدث عن سلوك البشر وكيفية استغلاله, لا ينصح به للسادة الـ .5- استخدمه باعتدال, فمعظم السلوكيات تعتمد في تأثيرها على قلة تنفيذ الآخرين لها, وإذ أنت أغرقت الجميع بها, فسوف يتبدد تأثيرها ككل شيء متوفر بسهولة من حولهم مهما كان أهمية ما تقوم به لهم. خذ الماء والهواء كمثال وعبرة.***ترجمة ""عبد الله محمد الزيادي"" عن ""دار الندوة الجديدة"" اللبنانية ترجمة جيدة جداً... ترجمة العنوان الرئيسي لـ ""كيف تختار الأصدقاء"" غير موفق, والعنوان الفرعي ""كيف تؤثر في الناس"" أكثر تعبيراً عن الكتاب.هناك ترجمات أخرى متوفرة, ولكني لم أطلع عليها.***تماماً ككتاب ""دع القلق وتعلم الحياة"", يسرد كارنجي الكثير من القصص الحقيقية المسلية لتوضيح نصائحه, ولإعطاء أمثلة عملية نستطيع استغلالها في حياتنا. أذكر منهم قصتان, والأولى منهما تصرفت فيها قليلاً:""إن معظم الشبان الراغبين في الزواج لا يهمهم أن تكون الزوجة المنشودة ربة بيت من الطراز الأول بقدر ما يهمهم أن تشبع غرورهم, وتمنحهم الإحساس بالأهمية والاعتبار!""ولعل هذا هو السر في أن أكثر الفتيات المثقفات يخفقن في الحصول على الأزواج, فإنك قد تدعو الفتاة المثقفة للغداء معك , فلا تلبث أن تتركك وقد تحمست لدراسة التيارات الهامة في الفلسفة المعاصرة - مثلاً- وماذا تكون النتيجة؟ تتناول غداءها بعد ذلك بلا رفيق.ولكنك قد تدعو إلى الغداء فتاة تعمل على الآلة الكاتبة ولم تدرس قط في الجامعة, فلا تلبث أن تثبت نظرها عليك, وتقول لك: ""حدثني عن نفسك"" وماذا تكون النتيجة؟ سوف تشعر بالأمان في صحبتها, وسوف تقول حتماً في لأصحابك: ""صحيح إنها ليست على قدر كبير من الجمال, ولكني ارتحت لها!"" منذ وقت قصير, وقع صديق لي في غرام فتاة لم يلبث أن خطبها, وبعد قليل من خطبته, رغبت إليه خطيبته في أن يتعلم الرقص فاستجاب لرغبتها. قال لي وهو يروي القصة: ""... والله يعلم أنني كنت في أمس الحاجة إلى دروس الرقص. كنت قد تعلمت الرقص منذ نحو عشرين سنة, فلما عدت إليه, عدت كما بدأته, وقد صارحتني المدرسة الأولى التي قصدت إليها, بهذه الحقيقة سافرة, قالت لي لي إنني على خطأ بيّن, وإنه يجب أن أنسى ما تعلمته في الماضي وأن أبدأ من جديد! ولكن هذا اقتضاني مجهوداً كبيراً, ولم يكن لدي دافع يدفعني إلى مواصلة التعليم فتركتها!. ""ولعل المعلمة الثانية كذبت علي, ولكني فضلتها! قالت لي إن رقصي قديم العهد بعض الشيء, ولكن المبادئ في جوهرها صحيحة. وأكدت أنني لن ألقى عناء في تعلم بعض الخطوات الجديدة.""لقد بثت المعلمة الأولى اليأس في نفسي بتأكيدها لأخطائي, أما الثانية فقد فعلت العكس تماماً: امتدحت الشيء الوحيد الصحيح في رقصي, وهونت كثيراً من شأن أخطائي.وكانت لا تفتأ تقول لي: إن لك أذناً موسيقية .. إنك راقص موهوب. ""وبرغم إيماني بأنني كنت – وسأظل – راقصاً من الدرجة الرابعة, إلا أنني كنت أتشكك أحيانا وأقول لنفسي : ربما كانت تعني ما تقول!. والواقع أنني كنت أنقدها المال بسبب ما تواليني به من تشجيع وتقدير!""

70 recetas para triunfar en la vida 
el cual mi madre me regaló hace varios años porque, en aquel entonces, ella, me sintió bastante desorientado en mi vida. Recuerdo que resultó siendo un gran regalo porque en verdad aquel libro me ayudó mucho para madurar, para ganar confianza, y para creer que todo lo que me proponga en el futuro puedo lograrlo, incluso si parece imposible. Enfrentarme a la vida real nunca fue sencillo para mí —de hecho aún tengo complicaciones para adaptarme en ciertas circunstancias— porque yo vivía en una burbuja de irrealidad. Siempre fui el mejor en mi colegio, no sufrí fracasos y/o frustraciones, pero al salir de esa burbuja me estrellé con la realidad y psicológicamente resulté bastante afectado. En unos pocos años pasé de ser un engreído sabelotodo a un fracasado con depresión. Fue en aquella lectura que conocí a Dale Carnegie, ya que en cierto momento del texto se realiza la mención correspondiente a este autor, y por tanto, mi curiosidad me llevó a investigar y posteriormente a leer este libro. En esa ocasión tuve una buena experiencia, el libro me gustó, aprendí mucho, pero el tiempo fue haciéndome olvidar poco a poco las lecciones aprendidas. Esa es la razón de mi relectura, incluso es probable que lo vuelva a leer en el futuro: Este tipo de obras se deben retomar cada cierto periodo de tiempo para recordar lo olvidado y también para aprender lecciones nuevas que posiblemente ignoramos en nuestras lecturas previas.
Cómo ganar amigos e influir sobre las personas
 es una gran obra que nos ayuda a reflexionar sobre los errores que cometemos cuando tratamos a nuestro prójimo. Todo el libro está cargado de historias, frases y lecciones; bellas lecciones que por su sencillez calan hondamente en nosotros, bellas lecciones que nos hace recapacitar sobre nuestro comportamiento, nuestras palabras, y la forma como nos relacionamos con los demás. Leer esta obra sirve para darnos cuenta que las personas no somos robots, y que en todas las ocasiones donde actuamos con antipatía, grosería, y agresividad, realmente hemos tratado a las personas como basura, y nadie, absolutamente nadie se lo merece. Carnegie nos invita a comprender al prójimo, a ganarnos su confianza, a ser amables, simpáticos, y especialmente a interesarnos con genuinidad en ellos. Carnegie nos invita a ser más humanos, nos invita a madurar, nos invita a seguir el ejemplo de cientos y miles de personas que por su buena comunicación tienen grandes amigos y éxito en sus vidas. Carnegie escribió esta obra para ayudarnos a ser mejores humanos. Como sus lecciones son prácticas y prometen buenos resultados, es recomendable no leer esta obra tan rápido, sino preferiblemente intentar practicar, poco a poco, los buenos hábitos propuestos por el autor. También es recomendable realizar muchas anotaciones porque de no hacerlo, nos perderemos las enseñanzas que en el libro aparecen, y como son tantas, entonces se vuelve una tarea imposible memorizarlas todas juntas. Si leemos esta obra como un libro normal, podríamos acabarlo en unas pocas horas, pero si deseamos emplear estos consejos en nuestra vida, lo recomendable es leer poca información en un solo día. Si desean leerlo al azar, también pueden hacerlo, no hay ningún problema con ello.La dinámica del libro es bastante pragmática. El autor nos cuenta una historia de un vendedor, presidente, político, comerciante, etc., y como una fábula, nos deja en cada una de ellas una moraleja importante; moraleja que va fortaleciendo en las siguientes historias del mismo capítulo. Eso me ha llevado a pensar que quizás la cantidad de ejemplos pueden llegar a ser exagerados. Con dos o tres ejemplos podría ser suficiente, en mi opinión, pero cinco o seis ejemplos que refuerzan la misma idea me parece algo innecesario. Lógicamente, no todas las historias impresionan a todas las personas de igual manera, por lo que comprendo que su objetivo es presentar historias diversas, ya que se supondría que alguna tendría que ayudar al lector a reflexionar. Este tipo de historias, y forma en que son narradas, me recuerda a las que se les cuenta a los niños para que aprendan a ser puntuales, responsables, dormir temprano, etc. Son escritas de una forma tan simple, sin atacar al lector por tener fallas o errores, y se siente una paciencia y una compresión tan alta en las palabras que me hace pensar que debió ser muy agradable entablar una conversación real con este señor. Una persona que te escucha, no te juzga, es amable contigo, y a la vez te da consejos sin ofenderte, es un amigo de verdad. Si tú, que estás leyendo esto, conoces a alguien así, cuida mucho esa amistad, es difícil encontrar alguien que esté dispuesto a gastar su tiempo en ti. Aunque no estoy de acuerdo con las lecturas obligatorias, pienso que esta obra sí debería serlo. Con tanta agresividad, odio e indiferencia, que hay por todas partes en el mundo, siento que este libro podría ayudar muchísimo a reducir la cantidad de peleas y problemas de convivencia que se viven en todos los ámbitos posibles: Trabajos, colegios, universidades, hogar, etc. No sé ustedes, pero a mí me parece tan molesto salir a caminar a la calle, con el objetivo de cambiar de ambiente, descansar, quizás meditar, y así respirar un aire más saludable, pero en vez de calmarnos resultamos llegando a nuestro destino más estresados de lo que estábamos. Tantas peleas, gritos, intolerancia, y escándalo por todas partes, es tan, pero tan molesto, que incluso pierdo las ganas de salir en muchas ocasiones. Debemos contactarnos con el mundo exterior, relacionarnos, caminar, y demás, porque somos seres sociales por naturaleza, pero a veces el escenario no ayuda mucho para motivarnos a hacerlo. Quizás si leyeran este libro por obligación no lo practicarían, seguiríamos siempre con los mismos malos hábitos, pero tal vez valdría la pena para intentar germinar la semilla de la duda en algunas personas que, a lo mejor, puede que si tengan la disposición para cambiar sus malos hábitos y actitudes. En los momentos en que se sientan furiosos, frenéticamente descontrolados, y tengan deseos de explotar violentamente sobre los demás, en esos casos, les recomiendo que primero lean un rato este libro, y si después de hacerlo aún tienen deseos de ser violentos, bien pueden terminar su cometido; pero, es probable, que su ira se reduzca mucho porque leyendo este libro comprendemos que somos tan culpables como los demás cuando una conversación se sale de control. Cuando lees este libro sientes la curiosidad de practicar lo que te propone el autor, y lo mejor es que puedes hacerlo en cualquier situación cotidiana de tu vida: Desde hablar con un niño para que te obedezca, o hablar con tu jefe para pedirle un aumento. Este libro puede ayudarte, como su título lo dice, a influir sobre las personas, pero a pesar de ello no encontrarás consejos de cómo manipular a las personas, o aprovecharte de ellos. No. Lo que encontrarás será un libro que te hará entender que sí deseas que alguien te siga, o «te haga caso», debes preocuparte por su bienestar y no solo por el tuyo. Influir sanamente en los demás comprende un intercambio equivalente para ambas partes.En la parte final se cuenta la vida de Dale Carnegie, y entonces es allí donde sentimos más simpatía con el autor porque comprendemos que es igual que nosotros, con sus problemas, sus sueños y dificultades, y que es un gran ejemplo a seguir porque lo que él hizo fue seguir su pasión para dedicarse de por vida a lo que siempre deseó hacer: Ser un conferencista. Es una historia muy bonita que me ha gustado mucho, la he releído varias veces —incluso en este momento mientras escribo esta reseña—, y entre más la leo más me encanta su historia de superación. En resumen, un libro muy bueno que nos ayuda a crecer. Lo leeré varias veces a lo largo de mi vida, y de cada lectura estoy seguro que aprenderé nuevas lecciones porque aprender a tratar a los demás es un camino interminable, y muy difícil de seguir, pero intentar transitarlo vale la pena porque nos traerá grandes beneficios, no solo económicos, sino de todo tipo. Sigue estos consejos y estarás siempre rodeado de grandes amigos, sigue estos consejos y no tendrás enemigos, sigue estos consejos y nunca estarás solo, sigue estos consejos y tendrás una mano amiga que estará siempre dispuesta a ayudarte. Libro que debería ser obligatorio, por tanto es supremamente recomendado.!121!“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”
‘How to win friends and influence people’ is one of the best self-help books I read in 2018. It’s a very popular book that I managed to avoid for years simply because I thought it might have cliché advice that I’d probably already know and I won’t find anything useful. Boy, was I wrong! It definitely has pieces of advice you probably have heard a million times already, from your parents, teachers or just any adult; you listen and get inspired for like 15 minutes but you don’t spend time pondering on it and it’s forgotten. I guess you need to be in a certain state of mind to absorb opinions and ideas. This book had me in that state and was able to hold my attention throughout.One of the most important things I took away from this book was ‘Give unto others what we would have others give unto us’. Now, I know everybody knows that! We, humans, are complex creatures; we have different personalities, temperaments, motivations but when everything is taken away, there are some core values that are similar in all of us. Our actions spring from what we desire, we crave appreciation, feeling of importance, and we want to be respected and listened to. This book tells you to peer into your mind and learn about yourself.It’s really important to get to know yourself first, to know what you like and what you don’t. In order to influence people, you need to put yourself in their shoes and approach the situation in that way. This takes tactfulness and patience. The author also makes use of wise quotes from philosophers and great people to explain his ideas, which I really liked. He also gives examples from the lives of successful people to elaborate his point and also, gives pointers on how to incorporate those pieces of advice in our daily lives. Every advice given in this book is valuable, no matter how commonplace it is. I believe this book should be a necessary read for students in school and college.All in all, it was very informative and useful book. There were so many great advises you could use in your daily life. I believe everyone should read this book at least once in their lives because it’s really worth your time. Read On Blog!121!1 ⭐ Holy hell! Give it a rest, Dale! (H)Why, oh hwhy, did I read this?! Carnegie’s principles display, boldly, the many wrinkles of their age but it’s not only that; it’s very hard to believe that this book/course was ever considered useful information, nay, even anything beyond laughable, by any self-respecting individual!  To summarise a few select points: 1. Remember, and relentlessly repeat, the victim’s name during conversation. That sweet, sweet nectar that is one’s own name will have them eating out of the palm of your hand. 2. Smile. Preferably a manic, unnerving smile with cheeks quivering and teeth buckling under 1200psi of clench. Hold this smile throughout entire conversation, even hwhile talking. People love a smile!! 3. Shut your piehole! For the love of god NEVER, under any circumstances, talk about something you’re interested in! Speak only of the other person’s interests as if it were the most fascinating thing you’ve ever heard... And do it “genuinely” damn it! Oh, and make them feel really important; lay it on thick, y’know?! “Oh, you’re a woodworking hobbiest and you personally made your office desk from American Hwhite Oak?! Oh Stan, you’re an absolute marvel!! Do take up the next 3.5 hours of my time discussing the finer details of this thrilling pastime, Stan!” or “HAHAHAHA! *maintaining manic smile* Oh Barry, you are literally the funniest and most important person I’ve spoken to in years, Barry! You mean to tell me, Barry, that hwhen it’s a bit quiet in here you just sit and watch all manner of marvelously funny cat videos on youtube?! Splendid! Oh, another? sure I’ve got time! HWhat could be more pressing?! This is just great, you’re great Barry!” Oh, and obviously make sure you do all of this sincerely, we’re not just trying to superficially flatter people here, c’mon whattya take me for?! 4. If you’re wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically!... Hell, even if you know for sure that you’re not wrong, it couldn’t hurt to act like you might be. 5. Dramatize your ideas. If you sell, say, cash registers for example. Next time you go into the neighborhood grocery store, randomly point out to the owner how positively shit his current cash registers are and explain that he is literally hemorrhaging cash every time he uses them instead of your superior product. Don’t just tell him though, raise your voice and make a scene. Begin throwing coins on the floor and then at the cashier screaming, “Can’t you see you’re literally throwing away money, Gary?!!”. Always use the name Gary, even if you know full well that’s not his/her name.  Self-serving, underhanded and insincere! You can smell the Carnegie training on furniture and used car salesmen from a mile away. Carnegie courses must’ve been like factories churning out greasy, mass-produced slimeballs whose false kindness and counterfeit smiles, rather than achieving the desired level of endearment, come across passive aggressive and condescending to any moderately discerning conversationalist. Just repeatedly, and self-righteously, claiming that you are honest, sincere and most definitely NOT advocating a bag of cheap and flattering tricks, doesn’t make it so... Though, evidently, it does make you rich!!121!This book is a life changer ! Really, I'm not making this up. This was exactly what I needed. Some things that are described in this book I realized before reading this book, but there were a lot of things I never thought about myself but are so true. I don't like conflicts and I found a lot of tips in this book about this topic..so how not to be in fights with people. Yaaay, my zen is safe! =)!121!This was really the world's first self-help book and undoubtedly helped many people build their self-esteem. It is easy to read and its tenants are easy to follow. The one criticism that many have justly laid on it is the feeling that you are manipulating people into being your friends or accomplices (thus the ""win"" in the title). As such, the techniques work with a subpopulation of people you run into over the span of your life nut certainly not all of them. And true friendships are about depth and mutual respect so no techniques are required. A more appropriate use of the book is how to behave and fit in in corporate America and for that, other than losing the tie and the hat, manners and ambitions have not changed so much for the book to become irrelevant. I prefer Getting Things Done personally.!121!Tiene mucho mérito escribir un libro así en 1936 y es absolutamente necesario ponerlo en el contexto de la época. El uso del lenguaje no está acorde a los cánones del siglo XXI, por ejemplo. Aún así, he aprendido mucho y he de decir que intentaré poner en práctica muchas de las enseñanzas que he leído. Todo es muy útil y está revestido con un ligero toque de ingenuidad.---------There is much merit in writing such a book in 1936 and it is absolutely necessary to put it in the context of the time. The use of language is not in keeping with 21st century canons, for example. Still, I have learned a lot and I must say that I will try to put into practice many of the lessons I have read. It is all very useful and overlaid with a slight touch of naivety.!121!Sometimes I felt this book was a bit too . . . ""used-car-salesmanshippy"". There are some good ideas in it, but there are also some things which felt like they were extremely disingenuous. I don't like FAKE people. There are some ideas in here which are quite fake.!121!Reading between the lines and paying attention to the biographical details you realise that Carnegie never was a successful salesman himself. Success only came late in life when he was teaching an evening school class on the topic of how to win friends and influence people. His students would share their stories about changes in thinking or attitude which had changed their lives, these then made their way in to the book. Once the book was published readers would send in their own stories which were added to later editions.As a result the book is a collection of anecdotes, many of which have people changing their circumstances or changing their lives by changing the way they thought, but all the same you think that the unending pile of washing up featured in one story always remains an unending pile of washing up whether you enjoy it, despise it, value it or feel oppressed by it. Still, the book keys into a timeless message that you may not be able to change reality, but you can certainly change the way you think about it although you could smash the plates I suppose.On the sinister side this is a book that celebrates positive thinking, which is to say that it ignores a realistic appraisal of the world in favour of having your cake and eating it, on one level this is a fairly harmless book on another it tends towards The Secret and the belief that others and oneself are to blame if you die when a ferry sinks, or if you are persecuted, or if you develop cancer because plainly such things only happen because you weren't positive enough . Barbara Ehrenreich discusses this all very nicely in Smile or Die. It is only a short book and won't harm you if you give it a read, but despite the title doesn't have a lot of advice on how to win friends or influence people. A good book to lend to people with a big smile as they will suspect that you are trying to win their friendship and/or influence them the beerfree way.!121!This book is a guide to life. I think several people should be required to read this book at least once. Teachers, emotional teenagers, employers, employees, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, friends, neighbors, politicians etc...I truly found this book oddly entertaining. Although it is a self-improvement type book, I couldn't put it down. Through the examples of many famous and successful people throughout history, this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice. I sincerely believed that my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved exponentially through reading this book and putting what I learned into action.I love this book and am going to require that my children read it before they get a job, a drivers' license, or a date.!121!Overall: A well written book with a lot of examples, including many of good folks from the history and many without any citation, but none-the-less seem real. The examples are written so that the message goes across well. Repetition is avoided. The stuff mentioned is pretty obvious and simple, but important and often ignored. Worth reading multiple times as the preface recommends. TEXT DELETED105	SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOUPRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people. PRINCIPLE 2: SmilePRINCIPLE 3: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. PRINCIPLE 6: Make the other person feel important–and do it sincerely. 110	You cannot win an argumentWhy not let him save his face? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle. Don’t forget this lesson! I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it. You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will always resent your triumph and “a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still…” 112	Which would you rather have, an academic theatrical victory or a person’s good will? You can seldom have both. Buddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,” and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation, and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cute the bite. 114	How to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:1.	Welcome the disagreement: Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.” If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. 2.	Distrust your first instinctive impressions: Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not at your best. 3.	Control your temper: Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. 4.	Listen first; Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend, or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. 5.	Look for areas of agreement: When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. 6.	Be honest: Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. 7.	Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully: and mean it! Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.” 8.	Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest: Anyone who takes the time to adisagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. 9.	Postpone actions to give both sides time to think through the problem: Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear to preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions. Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, what the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me? PRINCIPLE 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. MORE LATER...!121!Why did I read this book?We’ve all heard of it. But none of us have ever really read it.And I know why. It was originally published in 1936. How can it possibly be relevant in 2009? Plus these types of advice, self-help, new-agey textbooks reek of banal, trite, clichéd, stereotypical drivel. We’re too good for that. They seem a little cheesy at least. They’re all like The Secret, right?We don’t want to sip on watered down hotel iced tea and listen to Zig Ziglar. We want to take a toke of a high-grade sativa strain and listen to some Creedence tapes!Regardless of my skepticism and cynicism, I found How to Win Friends and Influence People to be extremely applicable and relevant.First of all, a note on the title: “How to Win Friends” is not accurate. It’s not at all about winning friends in the sense that we modern youths would consider a friend. Carnegie seems “how to win friends” to mean the “accumulation of calculated, beneficial relationships.”I feel very strongly that “friends” are the people we can be dicks to, the people we can get drunk with, yell at, act stupid, and not have to worry about the third of six ways to make people like you (remember their name). Everyone else? Everyone else you’re actually nice to (bosses, co-workers, certain family members, people you pass on the street) are not friends. Friends are the people you can tell to fuck off and they’ll still drive you to the airport at 6am the next day. This book is how to deal with everyone else with seemingly-obvious principles such as smile, be a good listener, talk in terms of other people’s interests, and make the other person feel important.So friends, not so much. But how to influence people, yes.Carnegie’s seminal work is packed full of anecdotal evidence illuminating the principle of each chapter and reinforced with a healthy peppering of Emerson quotes:“Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”Though written in 1936, HTWFAIF is refreshingly relevant in a modern age marked by the dichotomy between incredible scientific accomplishments, brilliant discoveries, understanding, knowledge, curiosity, but yet a stunted ability to talk and peacefully coexist with those we disagree.Take, for instance, Carnegie’s encouragement to dramatize your intentions in order for them to be recognized and accepted:“This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.”And on the eighth day, God created cable news.Carnegie thwarts our skepticism about the nobility of his intentions and promises that he is no self-help scammer, a Kevin Trudeau, Carnegie promises, he is not:“The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.”And for the most part, I have to agree with Carnegie. I like this book. Its advice and suggestions are totally useful and effective. We tend to consider ourselves living in grim times, what with the wars, crumbling economy, job losses, and uncertain future, why not have a little possitivity and engaged enthusiasm for our fellow man?And Carnegie even foretold a danger in our current time. He warns us of Obama:“The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses.”Uh oh.!121!I've heard, I wash told, I have read how amazing 'The Book' of Dale Carnegie for years and always wanted to read it. And I finally did. And it came nothing short of living up to the world class reputation it has. Mr. Carnegie explains the concepts behind influencing people, not as a bag of tricks, but as a true way of life. All the chapters contain highly self-explanatory examples to help readers understand each principle. In my opinion, this is one of the books one must read in his or her lifetime, preferably at the earliest.!121!5/5 🌟 Sin dudas una joya de libro, ideal para potenciar o desarrollar tus habilidades blandas, un libro corto pero con un gran potencial para tu vida si aplicas lo enseñado! 👌Es de esos libros que cambia tu vida!!121!4.0 ⭐GENRE - NON FICTION/SELF HELP.This book was published in 1936 which makes it quite a old book to read, the author has made a good attempt in explaining how you can actually win friends and influence people with the help of Stories, examples and quotes.Altough I had too much of high expectations from this book however the points discussed in the book did convince to a great extent what are the important factors to influence the opposite person, I personally facing a lot of issues in relationships due to the bluntness in my speech was able to find answers to a certain extent.Well it's a self help book at the end of the day, this book shall suit your cause unless and until you honestly accept your shortcomings and practice what has been preached in this book on your surroundings.Thank you 😊!121!2.5 *Phen này mà không được 20 bạn donate booktalk chắc tui bỏ sự nghiệp phân tích sách luôn quá.Dù sự nghiệp mới có nhú lên chút xíu.Phải rất nỗ lực, đánh lạc hướng bản thân, kiên nhẫn lắm mới đọc xong được cuốn này để ngày mai làm Lật sách.Ôi hỡi ôi, bán chạy nhất thế giới...!121!Disclaimer: I wrote this when I was 17. My feelings have changed but I'm keeping this up for the fun of it.As most of you know this is not the type of book I normally reach for, so it should be no surprise that my dad recommended it. He's a huge fan, so for whatever reason I decided to give it a shot. This is by no means a bad book, but since we're on the topic, I'll mention the cons first. I skimmed through the latter half of this book today. The first half took me over a month. This isn't boring per se, I just happen to have the attention span of your average Millennial. I have the worst patience (as in non-existent) to boot. If I'm not constantly entertained by something and it takes longer than ten seconds, I get irritable. This book was full of real life examples. Whenever you thought it would finish, another would come.A lot of the principles are obvious, but let's be honest. Am I going to apply any of them to my life? Nope.The thing is, I don't want to win friends and influence people. I want to avoid people and take long solitary walks. I don't want to influence anyone because I am a bad influence. My tactic for gaining friends is very simple.
Stage 1: Hiss and moan when anyone shows interest in you, but silently be flattered. Never show interest in anyone. That's antisocial suicide.Stage 2: Go into asshole mode - make snide remarks, but be nice enough so the person will let you keep making snide remarks.Stage 3: Have no tact or diplomacy because that means you're lying and possibly weak.Stage 4: Finally decide you may like them and go into nice-but-hyper-and-distracted mode. NB, this does not occur during shark week.Stage 5: Fluctuate constantly and be a burden forever. Cut ties with anyone who slightly irritates you because you believe in minimalism in all things.This method works wonders and leaves me nearly friendless. How I influence people is slightly more corrupt so I won't go into that. In the end there's not many wonderful things I can say about this book. Still, I don't feel like it's bad. It's just not for me personally.!121!Great book!I think this book really holds up even today, being originally written in 1939, that's almost a century old and still very much relevant. It's a fundamental book on human behaviour, how we function and its really helpful. 

“Once I did bad and that I heard ever.Twice I did good, but that I heard never.”

Now it has its problems, for instance, an argument can be made whereby this book promotes fake relationships, or it may sound so. However, that depends on how you interpret this book. It's not meant for trickery, rather it promotes kindness and good social skills. How you use it depends entirely on you (the reader).

The Art of War (Paperback),Sun Tzu,3.96,484341,-400,"Twenty-Five Hundred years ago, Sun Tzu wrote this classic book of military strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. Since that time, all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare and civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business and everyday life. The Art of War is a book which should be used to gain advantage of opponents in the boardroom and battlefield alike.","Hey! Look at me stepping outside my comfort zone!I saw this audiobook in the library, and I thought it looked interesting.Hell, I've got 4 kids. This could come in handy.Next year I'll have not one, but two teenage boys. I need to prepare myself to defend my babies home from the invading whores hoards. I figured this book would help me gird my loins (or whatever it is you do) when you head into battle.Back off, Skanks! You're not getting past the front door! Still, even teenage boys pale in comparison to the sheer terror that comes with sharing a home with pre-pubescent girls...Retreat! Retreat! We've misjudged the enemy's abilities! I can definitely use the help of a master strategist. Although, in retrospect, I actually have one of those living with me. She's 10, and she's been fully in charge of my home since she clawed her way out of my womb. My husband says I was hallucinating (bless whoever came up with drugs in the delivery room!), but I swear I saw her gnaw off her own umbilical cord.She's ruthless, clever, and has the smile of an angel.Lucifer was an angel, too...Anyway, I could have skipped this and simply begged for the honor to sit at her feet and learn.
Teach me your ways, Mighty Warrior!
But the cover said this was only a 4 1/2 hour book.What? She probably wouldn't have shared her secrets anyway...Confession time: I did not make it all the way through the audiobook.I did, however, make it all the way through The Art of War. That part of it was short. I don't know what the actual length of time was, but I listened to it while I was making dinner, and then took it with me on a short jaunt to Wal-mart. Boom! Done! Thank you, Sun Tzu! The rest of this particular audio is supposedly speculation about Sun Tzu's life, and a history lesson on the politics of the time he lived in. Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah...All the names bled together in my head, and the words just sort of sloshed around inside my brain till I finally gave up on it.I'm not saying it was badly done or boring, but my tiny dinosaur brain isn't built to process books without pictures. So listening to someone with a smooth jazzy voice read from a history book is just like asking for some sort of an internal meltdown to happen up there. So. The Art of War.I actually don't feel like Mr. Tzu had much to say that would help me out. I mean, a there were a few things translated into real life...Be consistent in rewards and punishments. Duh.Employ spies. Double duh. I've got every one of my kids on the payroll, and they each think they're the only mole I've got. Suckers!Make sure the enemy is tired before attacking. Hello? Why do you think I'm out at the pool all day long with them? It's not like I enjoy basking in the glow of my cellulite, all while gaining a few more liver spots. If Sun Tzu had mentioned dosing the enemy with Benadryl before long trips, I would have been more impressed.A lot of it, however, was about how to fight on different types of terrain. Swampy, mountainous, flat, etc..That's no help to me, buddy!I need some sort of inside scoop that's going to give me an edge over the full blown she-devil I live with, the smaller demon-in-training (currently under the tutelage of the aforementioned she-devil), and the two walking hormones that used to be my little boys!I can't hold 'em off much longer! I'm going down! Going dow....*pants frantically*Anyhoo, I'm glad I read listened to it. It's one of those books you need to study...not read, though. So, I'm pretty sure I missed the vast majority of wisdom by doing it this way. But so what? I can say I've read it!I feel like a badass now, and that's all that's important.Pbbbt!!121!Simply put, Sun Tzu says that it is better not to fight than to be involved in a conflict, but if you are going to have to fight, then you have to do it to win, and these are the various strategies, often brutal, that will get you that result.Niccolò Machiavelli, in The Prince says if you are in a position of power and seek to maintain it, it is better to be loved and respected, but if you can't achieve that, then at least enforce respect and these are the, often brutal, strategies that will get that result.I say, if you are going to be a politician in the generally-winning party and you don't like reading much, The Prince is for you. Very sly. If however you see yourself in opposition, arguing your point, try Sun Tzu first.For the rest of us the books are short and make interesting historical and somewhat philosophical reading but they aren't going to change your life other than giving you a leg up on the intellectual book ladder, always a plus for the pseuds! Who, me? Yah think...!121!I definitely never thought i'd want to read a book about Chinese military strategy written in 5th century BC .... yet here we are.This one turned out to be so interesting.!121!The Art of Goodreads
1. Lotz says: The greatest books are the ones you never have to read, and the greatest words are the ones you never have to speak. Likewise, the greatest book reviews are the ones you never have to write.2. There are five types of books: (1) Ones I have read. (2) Ones I have not read. (3-5) It's complicated.3. To begin a book, find its weakest point. This is commonly the first page.4. Do not turn the page too slowly, as you will make it greasy; do not turn it too quickly, as it might tear.5. If a sentence is giving you trouble, make like you're going to skip over it, and then read it all at once really fast to take it by surprise!6. If a sentence is particularly difficult, yell it at the top of your voice, trying to imitate the sound of the cock when the sun peaks over the distant mountains.7. Do not let your teachers or professors know if you have actually read your assigned readings. Keep them in suspense. Then you can subject them to your will.8. To impress the erudite girl, take well-known quotes and misattribute them, so that she can correct you. She will feel smart, and you will rush in for the kill!9.

You can apply the lessons of military tactics to any aspect of your life, as long as you don't mind going to prison.12. Fun fact: If you read the English translation of The Art of War backwards, and in a Jamaican patois, it exactly reproduces the original Chinese.13. If a word is giving you difficulty, you have two options: (1) use a dictionary, you dolt; (2) skip over it, because who has time in life for such things?14. The Empire in Star Wars could totally have won if they had just used more spies.15. The same goes for Sauron in The Lord of the Rings.16. When running out of ideas for a book review, the wisest course of action is to stop.17. The second wisest action is to keep going.!121!Years ago, I wanted to lose some weight, and I started a 60-day challenge. When I was at work, I was sure to tell a certain co-worker my goal. Why? Was he my friend? No way. I detested this guy. He was so disrespectful, talked over me, and lied. But I used that to my advantage. Because once I told this gentleman my goal there was no chance that I was going to let him see me fail.Oh to have a great enemy! The Art of War has several different translations. Some of them are better than others. Originally, I checked one out of the library (the Peter Harris translation), but I couldn’t get an audiobook to match that particular text. I ended up buying a copy from Amazon (the Lionel Giles translation) and an audiobook. However, I liked the original version from the library better.This book offers 13 lessons for war. However, most of them are extremely repetitive. They usually boil down to some version of attack your enemy by surprise and think before acting. The Poppy War seemed to have a better and more engaging discussion of strategy.This book is a bit outdated because so much has changed since 5th century BC. For example….Once upon a time, there was a library called the Troy Public Library. During the recession, the city didn’t have enough money to keep the library running so it asked for a very slight tax increase. However, one political group went into overtime about taxes, taxes, taxes. The conversation became all about taxes and not about the library or reading. The sweet, kind, loving, intelligent, and gentle library lovers had to come up with a plan to save the library. And quick. They made up a campaign, “Vote To Close Troy Library August 2nd Book Burning Party August 5th” Now, this enraged the Trojans, and the campaign reached the national level. People turned out to vote 342% greater than projected, and the library was saved. That’s how we do it in Troy.

I’ve heard so many people rave about it that I expected it to be more readily applicable to modern-day conflict. It’s interesting because of its age, but not for much else.!121!Sūnzǐ Bīngfǎ= The Art of War, Sun TzuThe Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 771 to 476 BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to a distinct aspect of warfare and how that applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalized as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare. It has a profound influence on both Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «هنر جنگ»؛ «هنر جنگاوری»؛ «آئین و قواعد رزم سون تزو مشهور به (هنر رزم سون تزو)»؛ «ه��ر رزم»؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ انتشاراتیها (قلم؛ موسسه فرهنگی هنری بشیر علم و ادب؛ فرا، سایپا دیزل؛ سازمان فرهنگی هنری شهرداری تهران؛ بعثت؛ کاروان؛ قطره؛ سیته؛ روزگارنو؛ آوای مکتوب)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز شانزدهم ماه آگوست سال 1995میلادیعنوان: هنر جنگ؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ حسن حبیبی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، انتشارات قلم، 1364، در ؟؟ص، موضوع: علوم نظامی، جنگ و جنگاوری، فن جنگ متون قدیمی از نویندگان چین - سده ششم پیش از میلادعنوان: هنر جنگ؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ بازنویسی: جیمز کلاول؛ مترجم: آیدا دریائیان؛ به اهتمام: سعید پورداخلی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، موسسه فرهنگی هنری بشیر علم و ادب، 1380، در 93ص، شابک 9646818811؛عنوان: هنر جنگاوری؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ مترجم: علی کردستی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، فرا، سایپا دیزل، 1383؛ چاپ بعدی سازمان فرهنگی فرا، 1387، در 143ص، شابک 9789647092340؛ ترجمه از متن انگلیسی با ترجمه ساموئل گریفیثعنوان: آئین و قواعد رزم سون تزو مشهور به (هنر رزم سون تزو)؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ مترجم: محمدهادی موذن جامی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، سازمان فرهنگی هنری شهرداری تهران، 1388، در 100ص، شابک 9789642381876؛ عنوان: هنر جنگ؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ عین الله عزیززاده فیروزی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، بعثت، 1387، در 116ص، شابک 9786005116052عنوان: هنر رزم؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ مترجم: نادر سعیدی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، کاروان، 1388، در 103ص، شابک 9789641750369؛ در چاپهای بعد نشر قطره در سال 1389؛ با شابک 9786001191527؛عنوان: هنر جنگ؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ محمود حمیدخانی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، سیته، 1392، در 128ص، شابک9786005253214؛عنوان: هنر جنگ؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ محمدصادق رئیسی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، روزگارنو، 1392، در 120ص، شابک9786006867342؛عنوان: هنر جنگ؛ اثر: سون دزو؛ حامد ذات عجم؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، آوای مکتوب، 1393، در 80ص، شابک9786007364192؛این کتاب «سون دزو»، در زبان چینی (سونتسی بینگفا)، خوانده‌ می‌شود؛ و به معنی «شیوه‌ های جنگی»؛ یا «روش‌های به کارگیری نیروها» است؛ این کتاب نخستین بار، در سال 1722میلادی، به زبان «فرانسه»، برگردانده شد، و این نخستین باری بود، که این کتاب، به زبانی «اروپایی»، برگردان می‌شد؛ نام این کتاب در ترجمه ی «فرانسوی»، «هنر جنگ» نامیده‌ شد؛ کتاب، یکی از خواستنی‌ترین مجموعه‌ های جنگی، در طول تاریخ، بوده‌ است.؛ چینیان باستان، شیفته‌ ی این کتاب بودند، گفته شده، که «مائو تسه‌ دونگ»، و «ژوزف استالین»، هر دو، در هنگام جنگ، این کتاب را می‌خوانده‌ اند.؛ از هر نظر، «سان تزو»، به عنوان یکی از اسطوره های استراتژی‌ پردازان است، از دیدگاه «سون دزو»، ایجاد عدم تقارن در جنگ، کلید پیروزی خواهد بود؛ به نظر ایشان، ایجاد و یا کشف عدم تقارن‌ها، و عدم تشابه‌ ها، بین طرفین درگیری، در نهایت، منجر به پیروزی خواهد شد، تنها مهم این است، که چه کسی، سریع‌تر به این عدم تشابهات پی ببرد، و یا چه کسی، سریع‌تر، از این عدم تشابهات، بهترین بهره‌ برداری را، در صحنه ی نبرد، یا دیپلماسی ببرد؛ «هنر جنگ» را، می‌توان به عنوان نمونه ی بسیار خوبی، از آموزه‌ های جنگ نامتقارن، یا حداقل تعریف مشخص، و روشنی از «جنگ نامتقارن»، در دوران کهن، به شمار آورد.؛ نخستین نکته‌ ای که «سان تزو»، روشن می‌کند، این است، که نامتقارن‌ها را، می‌توان در ابعاد، و حوزه‌ های گوناگون یافت، و یا، آفرید؛ ایشان باور داشتند، که در حین درگیری، ابعاد «سیاسی»، «دیپلماسی»، «اقتصادی»، و «روحی»، حذف نخواهند شد، و در واقع، برای توجه نشان دادن تنها به یک روی سکه در جنگ، که همان بعد ویژه ی نظامی منظورشان است، هشدار می‌دهندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 06/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!If anyone is looking for a war general I am available and well versed in war tactics due to this book. Hook me up.!121!Who reads the Art of War?OK, sure everybody, or anybody can, but who actually does and why?If we could somehow take a survey and create a pie chart of who reads this 2500 year old Chinese manual, what would we find, who reads it?Military professionals, sure; executives, probably – wanna be executives, almost certainly; sports coaches, law enforcement officers, school teachers, teenage gamers, etc etc.The title will get attract and repel many all by itself. The text, full of philosophical musings and anecdotal asides, will lose and / or gain many more.What will readers take from these words written so long ago? One thing, unfortunately, is that human nature does not seem to change – if Master Sun was a wise and great general 2500 years ago, people had been fighting long before then and enough for him to be considered a master of the subject. Even a casual observer of history will notice that there have been plenty of students of war ever since.In history – how many humans have been killed in war, in battle, in organized conflict? Old age and cancer and heart trouble seems to account for a great many deaths, but throughout history there seems to be a virus that gets too many of our young people.One thing that can be drawn from this tome is that if war is to be fought, if it is inevitable, if a line has been crossed (or a river in Italy) and there is no going back, then it must be fought to win. Military leaders are taught to be prepared and decisive, to act.But for me, and I think the everlasting philosophy that should be taken from this work, is that war is costly, and brutal, and ugly and should be avoided if at all possible. Hawks in the congress and saber rattlers elsewhere seem to be conspicuously NOT in the military; rather the WE to which they ascribe is most frequently “we” in the collective sense, but in every sense a “we” that does not see them getting dirty or bloody.What do readers other than military leaders take from this? To go for the jugular? To win at every cost? Not if they’ve actually read it. Preparation and contemplation and the ability to act when necessary are all elements attributed to the Art, and certainly decisiveness when the time is right, but not savage brutality or chaos for the sake of destruction. Ultimately this is about conflict, strategy and leadership – themes that are relevant to more than just the military.An important work that should be read.** 2018 addendum - this is at once a great source of quotes but also a work that is likely misquoted frequently. I heard a quote recently that made me wonder if the speaker had it right, misquoted, or was just making up a quote and attributing the statement to Sun Tzu for effect; and that made me think of Kevin Klein's character Otto from A Fish Called Wanda.!121!""The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.

 This book, written in the 5th century BC, tells us the strategies and tactics needed for winning a war. Sun Tzu tells us that no nation is ever benefitted by prolonged warfare, and it is better to avoid battles. If we reach a point where war is inevitable, Sun Tzu will help us win it in the best way possible without hurting many people. Even though it was written centuries ago, all the tactics mentioned in it are still relevant.—————————————————————————

Yay! Took me a lot of time due to my exams and uni in general.“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” I wanted to read The Art of War for very long and I finally managed to get to it. And I liked it. I think everybody should read it because many of the ideas from the Art of War can be found in different fields, for example in business. “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.”“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.” “All warfare is based on deception.”“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” “Danger has a bracing effect.”!121!How does a Fifth Century BC(!) Chinese Military text be of so much interest to so many people over the following 2,500 years and even now today? The answer is quite simple, it's because this treatise could just as well be called The Art of Strategy. Essentially this book manages to give simple and still coherent today, advice on dealing with conflict.What surprised me initially, but made sense when I thought about it, was how well structured, accessible and obvious (at times) the guidance in this book is. I can imagine thousands of Eighties 'businessmen' carrying this book in their pocket to help steer them through conflicts in business. Obviously a book to read before you die. As this book is mentioned throughout our multimedia continuously it's nice to finally have more detailed context. 8 out of 12.2022 read!121!While Sun Tzu is constantly praised for his work on The Art of War, I find it hard to believe that it has inspired anyone. This famous military strategy book has provided people such as Napoleon and the cast of 'Survivor: China' advice on handling the opposing force. However, despite the simple (yet adequate) translation that Lionel Giles provided, The Art of War does nothing more than to reiterate common sense. Sun Tzu asks the audience to not show off their strong points, but to lead the enemy to think that they are at a weak state. Does the average right-headed general not know this?In addition to that, Sun Tzu starts off by glorifying his tactics and dares any ignorant generals to oppose him. He says that he can predict a battle's outcome based on that alone. It almost seems as if he is basking in his own arrogance. The Art of War may have once been an excellent strategy book, but it's also out-of-date in many ways. Only read this if you're interested in Imperial Chinese military.!121!Libro importante en la antigüedad, pero obsoleto en nuestro presente.En realidad 1,8Cuando inicié en este mundo de escribir reseñas en Goodreads, solía impresionarme mucho por aquellos lectores que, recién finalizada su lectura, ya tenían en menos de veinticuatro horas un texto súper largo sobre su opinión, análisis, etc., de su experiencia. Recuerdo que pensaba constantemente algo parecido a «¿Cómo pueden organizar tan rápido sus ideas? Son unos profesionales». Y por ello, quizás para intentar hacer algo similar, en ese tiempo empecé a escribir unas reseñas —si se le pueden llamar así— rarísimas que no tenían orden, sentido, ni propósito. En ese tiempo recuerdo que leía Harry Potter, y me sentía tan presionado por escribir una reseña antes de marcar el libro como «leído», que tardaba mucho en comenzar la próxima lectura; sentía que si no escribía algo de inmediato se me olvidaría todo lo que podría expresar en ese instante. Sin embargo, fue en esos tiempos, cuando leyendo las reseñas de una chica española muy agradable llamada Elena Rodríguez (Si alguna vez lees esto te doy mis infinitas gracias por inspirarme), observé que ella usaba unas palabras mágicas que le permitían darse tiempo de escribir con calma lo que tuviera que expresar; esas palabras eran «Reseña completa más adelante». Aquellas palabras me inspiraron y me hicieron replantear la forma cómo escribía, y por ello, siguiendo su ejemplo, desde entonces también las uso y cambié mi método de hacer reseñas: ahora prefiero tomarme el tiempo necesario —a veces seis meses— para escribir con paciencia, neutralidad y cordura lo que en verdad pienso de un libro. He preferido ser lento pero cauto. ¿Cómo hago para no olvidar nada si ha pasado tanto tiempo? Muy sencillo, realizo anotaciones de mis sensaciones. ¿Y por qué cuento esta historia específicamente en la reseña de este libro? Pues bien, esto lo hago porque de no ser por este método, la reseña de este libro sería completamente tóxica debido a la insatisfacción tan grande que sentí recién finalizada mi lectura, pero ahora, han pasado los meses, y ahora sí me siento con la capacidad de escribir con neutralidad sobre una historia que aunque, ya no tiene utilidad en nuestros tiempos, no merece que la condenen o la destruyan como hace unos meses pensaba hacer. El arte de la guerra es un libro directo, escrito como un manual de televisor, que instruyó a sus contemporáneos sobre lo que se tenía que saber al momento de enfrentar una guerra. Literalmente dice algo como «Si te ocurre X situación, entonces haz Y solución», «Un buen comandante es quien XXX, un mal comandante es quien XXX». Así, simple, sencillo, sin misterio, lo dice en el lenguaje más básico posible para que el futuro aprendiz de la guerra lograra interpretar sin dificultad cada uno de los consejos mencionados. La información es demasiado primitiva, pero teniendo en cuenta que el libro tiene más de dos mil años de antigüedad y que en ese tiempo eran muy privilegiados los que sabían leer, entonces este libro pasa de ser un texto obsoleto en nuestra actualidad, a un texto antiguo de gran valor para nuestros antepasados, que lograron sobrevivir y vencer a sus enemigos gracias a un pequeño libro como este. Este libro lo debieron leer muchísimos comandantes, reyes y sinfín de personas con un vasto poder, y por libros como este cambió la historia del mundo. Es decir, en nuestra actualidad puede parecer un libro que no sirve para nada, pero en el pasado fue un texto que cambió los acontecimientos de nuestra sociedad. Un libro así es absurdo criticarlo, no tiene sentido hacerlo. Es como si juzgáramos con nuestro «yo adulto», a las primeras tareas que nos dejaron en nuestra niñez. Es muy diferente el nivel de educación, por lo que es bastante irrespetuoso desprestigiar algo, solo por tener el beneficio de tener una mejor formación. ¿Ahora entienden por qué decía que las palabras «Reseña completa más adelante» cambiaron mi estilo completamente? Esta perspectiva nunca la pensé hace unos meses.A pesar de que mencioné que el libro no tiene ninguna utilidad para nosotros, puede que en el fondo sí. Si eres una persona que quiere escribir una historia, y en ella piensas planear una guerra, pues este libro te cae como anillo al dedo porque podrás aprender a realizar una gran ambientación de aquellas escenas. El lector te lo agradecerá porque aquellas batallas parecerán más lógicas, más reales, y de esa forma las escenas te quedarán increíbles. También, este libro, podría ayudarnos a comprender mejor las guerras del pasado, aprendiendo a interpretar los resultados de dicho evento y comprendiendo mejor el motivo por el que se tomó la decisión de atacar, huir, etc. ¿En qué momento X o Y país perdió la guerra? ¿Fue por atacar? ¿Fue por la insurrección de sus filas? ¿Fue por falta de carácter de su comandante? Todo eso podremos empezar a analizarlo como una partida de ajedrez, observando jugada tras jugada hasta el momento en que todo finaliza con el inevitable jaque mate. Con este libro he aprendido que las guerras en el pasado no eran tan épicas y deseadas como lo describen en la televisión, sino que justamente era lo contrario. Las mejores guerras eran las que no se comenzaban, las que se ganaban sin derramar una gota de sangre. Conclusión que me hace entender que esas guerras son las que libran actualmente los gobiernos y países cada día: Atacar sin atacar, debilitar al enemigo con multas y partidarios en contra, controlar la economía del mundo con la posesión de los recursos, controlar y controlar. O, si por el contrario, lo que buscas en este libro es una enseñanza para tu vida, la única que podrás hallar es que cada problema que enfrentas es una guerra, y que de tus capacidades, decisiones y equilibrio mental, dependerá la resolución de cada uno de ellos. Cada uno combate una guerra interna, por lo que aprendiendo a analizar a nuestros enemigos secretos, posiblemente podremos encontrar estrategias que nos volverán vencedores de cada batalla que debamos luchar. No puedo negar que cuando recién finalicé quedé completamente insatisfecho, sentí que me había equivocado de lectura, y que este libro no servía para nada: Y en partes es verdad. Naturalmente las expectativas han jugado en mi contra porque siendo completamente honesto esperaba otro tipo de libro. Yo esperaba un libro más interesante, con algo de historia, no sé quizás algún personaje, pero mi falta de investigación sobre este libro me llevó a la completa frustración por lo que es realmente esta obra. El arte de la guerra no se debe leer con el objetivo de buscar una historia en sí —como cualquier otro libro— sino se debe hacer con cero expectativas, sin un objetivo claro, y comprendiendo que esto solo es un texto antiguo, que por arte de magia no desapareció con el paso del tiempo. No es un libro indispensable de leer, es más como un recuerdo de la humanidad, del patrimonio que nuestra raza ha venido dejando con el paso de las generaciones. ¿Recomiendo el libro? A pesar de las mencionadas posibles utilidades de este libro en la actualidad, la verdad no lo recomiendo. Si quieres aprender sobre la guerra, posiblemente hay cien fuentes de información más útiles actualmente, que este pequeño texto antiguo. Mi calificación de dos estrellas refleja justamente lo que he vivido: Una obra que no me ha gustado, pero que en el pasado fue importante; ya no lo es, pero sí lo fue. En la actualidad solo es un recuerdo, una prueba más de nuestra historia, nada más que ello. Libro no recomendado.!121!یک فرمانده ی بزرگ نظامی، پانصد سال قبل از میلاد مسیح، کتابی اعجاب انگیز و ستودنی در مورد شیوه های فرماندهی لشکر می نویسد که تا سال های سال، در کشورهای شرق دور به عنوان دستور راه فرماندهان جنگ استفاده می شده. هم اکنون این کتاب در لیست کتاب های پیشنهادی ارتش امریکا برای دانشگاه های افسری و نظامی است.این کتاب، درست در مقابل  هاگاکوره: کتاب سامورایی قرار می گیرد.هاگاکوره، کتابی سامورایی، یاد می دهد که چطور از شکست و مرگ نهراسید و اهدافی والاتر از سودهای دنیوی و عقل حسابگر داشته باشید: به فکر شجاعت باشید، و افتخار. می گوید اگر خواستید انتقام کسی را بگیرید، بدون این که وقت را تلف کنید تا محاسبه کنید که چطور پیروز می شوید، به دل دشمن بزنید و اگر هم کشته شدید، چه بهتر. چرا که «طریقت سامورایی بر مردن استوار است».هنر رزم، در مقابل، کاملاً سودگرایانه است و به شما می آموزد که چطور قبل از اقدام به دقت و با هوشمندی همه چیز را محاسبه کنید، و استراتژی های خود را دقیق، و البته همراه با انعطاف، مشخص کنید تا حتماً به پیروزی دست بیابید. می گوید اگر محاسبات تان نشان می دهند در جنگ شکست می خورید، بیهوده منابع مالی و انسانی را هدر نکنید و به فکر حیله ای باشید تا کمترین تلفات را بدهید. به همین دلیل معمولاً هنر رزم را به عنوان یک کتاب «موفقیت» می خوانند، هر چند به اشتباه.خواندن هر دو کتاب با هم، فرصت بسیار خوبی بود برای مقایسه ی دو طرز فکر کاملاً متضاد در دو کشور نزدیک به هم: چین و ژاپن.!121!Frankly, I got tired of my husband quoting this and having no idea what he was talking about. So, Heidi-the-Hippie/Librarian picked up The Art of War. I must love him a great deal because this was so not my thing though I valiantly struggled my way through it. I'd say about three quarters of the book was commentary and translation quibbles on the text itself, which is really rather brief and kind of pretty in a ""this is how you kill a bunch of people"" sort of way.My big take-aways from this were:1 Pay attention to where you are and what's going on around you all the time, especially in war. And also be super sneaky about what you're going to do. ""..concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act."" loc 11432 If you have to fight, do it fast because it's too expensive to do for long. ""There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged war."" loc 822, ebook.3 Everybody uses spies and if you don't, then you're going to lose because the other guy is for sure using spies.4 Be flexible and make the call as things happen. Don't stick to orders from an emperor who's really far away because he doesn't know what the heck is going on like you do. ""Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions."" loc 1296, ebook.5 Know who you are and who you're fighting. This knowledge makes you strong so other people can't determine your future. Use it to win your war. ""The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable."" loc 1542, ebook.6 Have a vision beyond what is right in front of you and guide yourself toward it, one good decision at a time. ""To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, ""Well done!"" To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease."" loc 1011-1030, ebook7 The place that you fight is very important as well as the officer who is calling the shots and telling you which way to go. If either of these things suck, you're in trouble. ""The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general."" loc 1886, ebook.8 Knowing small details about the enemy is very important. For example, if the dudes you're going to war against put their pots and pans away, they're planning on dying in battle. Who knew, right? ""When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the campfires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death."" loc 1752, ebook.So, that's The Art of War. Now back to my regularly scheduled reading. :)!121!Evidently, it seems, for the last couple thousand years, EVERYONE has been using the same textbook on how to conduct a war. It also seems to be that nobody even knows for sure who wrote the book or when, but everyone uses it anyway. Included in this book are precious reminders that strategy helps you win, retreating helps you not die, if you outnumber the enemy 5 to 1, attacking would probably be a good idea, and also if you're a tiny country surrounded by powerful countries, it might be time to make an alliance or two. If these sound like things you don't already know, but would like to know, then this book is for you. However, in the off-chance you're in a position to command a war against enemy forces, and you DON'T study this book THOROUGHLY, you're probably going to die. Horribly. And all your country's women, children, and probably most of the men will be raped and slaughtered in such gruesome manner as to make those easily victorious soldiers who just did the raping and slaughtering vomit from their own gruesomeness.!121!So many little wars must be waged daily. Works on the battlefield and the office.CLASSICS:""When the enemy is relaxed, make them toil. When full, starve them. When settled, make them move.""""In conflict, straightforward actions generally lead to engagement, surprising actions generally lead to victory.""""Thus those skilled in war subdue the enemy's army without battle .... They conquer by strategy.""""Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril. When you are ignorant of the enemy, but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril.""""In war, numbers alone confer no advantage.""""To ... not prepare is the greatest of crimes; to be prepared beforehand for any contingency is the greatest of virtues.""""What is of the greatest importance in war is extraordinary speed: One cannot afford to neglect opportunity.""!121!It is hard to speculate that this book has been written for one single era...When you read it you realise it meant to stay and teach all the humanity, a book that needs to be taught in schools, teaching kids how to THINK....How it is SIMPLE to THINK....Now THAT`S somthing they don`t usually teach us to know when we are nothing but small lads....Such a damn complicate world :(Here`s a small taste of what you may find in this small book :)------------------------ According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one's plans.- All warfare is based on deception.- Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.- Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.- Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.- In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.- It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.- To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.- In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack — the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of manœuvres.- Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.- Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.- The clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.- Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.- Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.- Manœuvring with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.- If you march thirty Li with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.- Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy: — this is the art of retaining self-possession.- Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.- Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.- When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.- Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.- Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.- In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.- All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.- When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.- If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: “Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.”- Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.- How to make the best of both strong and weak — that is a question involving the proper use of ground.- Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.- No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.- Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.- Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army's ability to move.!121!If you've ever picked up a self-help book where the author is repeatedly stating the obvious, then you've experienced the writing style of this book. The overall concepts could've been summarized in a short essay rather than a book. Its length is a testament to its antiquity, though the author has done a noble job of re-ordering and editing bits of the chapters to provide continuity and to delete repetition.Oriental philosophy is often ripe with a kind of double-speak and this book is no exception.The main idea, covered ad nauseam, are that generals must be wise, adapt to changing situations, and maintain order.What people get out of this book is whatever they want to read into it. It was an alright read but, in general, the book is overrated.!121!This was on the ""Surprise Yourself"" stack at the library. It was a choice between ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and ""The Art of War"". I took the latter even if I think I'm more of a lover than a fighter. Besides, the stack was on the front desk, choosing the former is kinda awkward. I am quite surprised I finished this book. I felt like I subjected myself to study even if I'm not required to do so. It's actually quite entertaining, more so that I know that there won't be a test later. Despite the title, the text (I don't know if I should call it a primer) is more concerned with nonviolent strategy: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”Sun Tzu appears to regard war as a necessary, but wasteful, evil, and one to be avoided whenever possible.

The work was written for men in command and leaders of states. It is for the ambitious and strong spirited; do not seek morality lessons here.Sun Tzu has been translated and interpreted countless times by people with little knowledge of true combat reality on either the physical or mental level.Most of the available translations and interpretations maintain a poetic approach that really doesn’t pertain to the times we are living in. There is a tendency to maintain a “mystique” regarding ancient knowledge. This is quaint, relative to today’s aggressive personality. We are living in a global network and must think in decisive terms if we are to succeed.He also chooses to leave out the valuable commentaries, which are supposed to be as much a part of the work as the original.He says: In reality, who cares what Ch’en Fu thinks about Sun Tzu’s hidden meaning about the jade stalk in the midst of the enemy’s goldfish pond? We are grown-up and intelligent enough to develop our own understanding without the need for quaint allegories. There is nothing sacred here. I find that approach unnecessary, limiting, and a waste of time to the educated reader.And here is a fun fact:As an acknowledged and world-recognized martial arts master, a Hanshi (which is the highest rank attainable), I am thoroughly aware of my responsibility for the interpretation of this doctrine, and I have made it incumbent upon myself to explain Sun Tzu’s tenets as I perceive them in a definitive manner.  — Must have recently taken a crash course on how to prepare a CV!Well, the book is a bore and a complete failure. It does no justice to Sun Tzu’s masterpiece and is worse than the regular self-help fare because it has only pretentiousness (of being tough, goal-oriented, warlord-like, if you please) and no real intention of even trying to 'help' any non-delusional executive.There is a reason why The Art of War is always presented poetically — it is so that the metaphors can be interpreted by the reader and applied as they want, so that they can understand the spirit of planned and prepared combat/conduct and apply that in life. That is why Art of war is an enduring and much loved classic.The author obviously has no clue about all this. He thinks it is a good idea to just present the text as-is, without ornamentation, without poetry, without any hints at broader applications beyond the battleground — Because the global corporation IS a battleground! Hello!Not realizing that once you strip away the poetry, you also strip the power of metaphor and what you have left is a dated txt that talks of war and claims to be for managers. It makes no sense to be told in plain prose to poison your enemy and insult his wife. Idiotic, without even being entertaining. Takes all the fun out of reading a bad book.!121!Sun Tzu's The Art of War is said to be the oldest military treatise in the world. Written centuries before the height of the Chinese empire before the common era, this slim volume did not make its way to the west until 1890, when French colonists brought a copy back to Paris. Regarded as classic by many, I decided to read the treatise for myself. Selecting an edition translated by Lionel Giles, the version I read was a mere 98 pages in length and at times underwhelming.The first forty pages of the volume I selected was a whirlwind of a rundown of over two thousand years of Chinese history. Not much quantity was given to any particular dynasty or time period, and it seemed as though this introduction was written for a high school text book. It was difficult to keep dates and names straight, and the only significant item that stood out was the construction of the Great Wall and its subsequent expansion. The only saving grace of this introduction was a timeline that contrasted eras of history with Chinese dynasties and their contributions to both Chinese and world history. While I found out that the origins of foot binding occurred nearly one thousand years ago, this historical footnote did little to benefit the actual text and its place in literary history.Perhaps the edition I read is dated. Currently many western schools teach Chinese to children as young as six so by the time that they are adults, these children turned adults are fluent in Mandarin. Likewise, as China has opened to the west, educated Chinese have knowledge in English. Unfortunately, I was at the liberty of what was available at my library system, and a modern, more fluid translation was not available to me. While it is apparent that Giles has knowledge of Chinese, at times it was hard to follow whether the words were Giles' insights or Sun Tzu's words. Including numerous examples of modern warfare to augment the text, Giles does not give justice to Sun Tzu's original intent. While these examples lend credence to how the Chinese military treatise has been implemented over the years, I was more interested in the original text than the interpretations of it.Tzu's actual text is limited due to the translation. It does offer advice to militaries as to how to implement battle plans. These include the knowledge of terrain, the season in which to invade, and knowledge of one's enemy and how to overcome one's deficiencies. Giles takes liberties in discussing why certain chapters are included where they are, and I give him credit for taking the time to discuss the Chinese tradition of honor and killing oneself if a soldier committed an error of warfare. I found this especially intriguing in terms of spying and what an honorable Chinese soldier would do when either caught by his enemy or when having failed to deliver information to his superior. As one who enjoys reading about and watching films about modern espionage, I thought it was fascinating that the Chinese had developed rules in regards to spies over two thousand years ago.The Art of War has been utilized by armies for over two centuries. The fact that it has endured is a testament to Chinese culture and traditions that have remained unspoiled over the millennia. I feel as though I would have enjoyed the treatise more if I had read a more modern version where the translation was seamless and did not indulge on the liberties of the translator. As a result I found myself reading more of the translator's interpretations and addendums than the actual text. I would be interested in reading an unspoiled edition of this classic as it remains relevant in warfare today.3 stars, downgraded for translation!121!My wife says watching me read The Art of War is like watching Danny DeVito read The Joy of Sex. I'm not sure how to take that.Bottom line, I'm a lover not a fighter. I started this because I know that many people love this work and say they get a lot out of it. But it became clear to me after quite a few pages that The Art of War really is about fighting a war no matter what other people might interpret it to be. So I'm not interested.Besides the two things I need to know about fighting I learned from The Princess Bride...1. Never get into a land war in Indo-China.2. Never make a bet involving death with a Sicilian.!121!3.5 ⭐Master Sun said:Ultimate excellence liesNot in applying false subtext to my teachingsTo suit your corporate self-help douche-baggeryBut in defending their integrityBy acknowledging them for what they areMilitary Stratagems, through and throughFor the purpose of review, my edition of ‘The Art of War’ is the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition. Edited, translated and with an introduction by John Minford. This was a really great way to experience this 2500-year-old military treatise. It begins with about a 50-page section reserved for the introduction, notes on text, list of dynasties and historical events as well as a list and description of the various canon commentators ranging from the Pre-Tang era (as early as 155-220) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). You are then given the treatise, unadorned, to read and make your own presumptions as to it’s meaning, followed by the same treatise with extensive commentary.Beginning with the work itself, as not everyone’s copy will have the commentary included, Sun Tzu’s treatise, in my opinion, is to be taken as nothing other than military strategy. The foundation of this work is exploitation and deception or “Success through cunning”. This is why I can appreciate its genius in the context of war and even individual combat (Bruce Lee applies many of the same underlying Taoist principles to his philosophy of ‘Jeet Kune Do’ with devastating effect) but can’t understand why anyone would want to introduce such dishonest tactics of subterfuge to their personal or work life. If I took anything beneficial from a personal perspective it was from the Taoist ideas which seem to permeate both Sunzi’s thoughts and those of the commentators. The treatise places huge importance on the planning and gathering of information through espionage, understanding the forms and dispositions of both yourself and the enemy army at any given time, unpredictability (formlessness), the benefits of advantageous terrain and both the virtues of an effective general as well as the pitfalls of a poor one.I’ve seen Sunzi’s work taken out of context and used in countless personal and corporate self-help books. The idea of taking pure ideology and twisting it, almost beyond recognition, to suit your own needs is nothing new. In fact, even Sun Tzu himself abuses a number of the basic notions of Taoist teachings to support his own ideas. As did the so-called “legalists” (Chinese fascists) of the warring states period who derived a perverted justification for their Orwellian State through certain Taoist principles. One of the more horrifying examples of distorting well-intentioned philosophies are the Chinese teachings regarding the “Art of Love”. These somehow take the wholesome lessons of the Tao and use them to justify a “relentless quest for sexual power” in which women are reduced to “objects for the enhancement of male potency and long life”. Get a load of this insane shit:
 “The man should defeat the enemy in the sexual battle by keeping himself under complete control… while exciting the woman till she reaches orgasm and sheds her Yin essence which is then absorbed by the man.”
Well, ladies, if that doesn’t get you up and about, I don’t know what will. I mean, as long as you’re cool with being perceived as a sexual enemy by your loved-one, objectified and having your precious “Yin essence” absorbed, the rest sounds ok, right?!... Doesn’t sound like the Tao that I know. I was concerned but not entirely turned away by the fact that this kind of philosophical distortion might leak into the commentary of this translation but I needn’t have worried. The commentary given here is completely literal. A number of the commentators themselves were generals in the centuries closely following the time in which these stratagems were allegedly compiled. Minford compiles these commentaries brilliantly. At times he has ordered them so as to be a sort of commentary on commentary. One philosopher will comment on Master Sun’s work, followed by another philosopher commenting on what the previous commentator said. Often this reads like a multi-generational conversation between strategists which I really enjoyed. You also really begin to get a feel for the personality traits of a number of the commentators. For example, there’s Du You, lover of cat analogies, or Cao Cao, the brutal general and strict disciplinarian who was prepared to take his own life upon breaking one of his own trivial rules. These were the things I liked about the commentary.On the other hand, there were times when the commentary became repetitive and at times felt redundant due to the fact that a lot of Sunzi’s information is quite literal and unclouded by metaphor. In stark contrast to something like the ‘Tao Te Ching’ by Lao Tzu whose teachings are infamously intangible and elusive. Sun Tzu already has a habit of repeating some ideas in an educationally beneficial manner. On a number of occasions, the exact phrase is repeated. Whether this was actually him or the way the bamboo strips have been compiled, I don’t know. The point is, when you pile on additional, unrequired clarification and expansion, it does begin to get a little tiresome after a couple of hundred pages.Sun Tzu: ”Deadlock” means that neither side finds it advantageous to make a move.Du You: What Sunzi means is that neither side finds it advantageous to move, and the situation remains deadlocked.Sun Tzu: Yeah bro, that’s literally exactly what I just said! Du You even listen?I enjoyed this, despite the last 100 pages becoming a bit of a battle of attrition, and am now really looking forward to reading the ‘Tao Te Ching’ and the ‘Analects of Confucius’ in the next month or so. Happy reading amigos! 
”Know the enemy,Know yourself, And VictoryIs never in doubt Not in a hundred battles.”!121!'The Most Influential Book of Strategy' of all time, Sun Tzu's Art of War might have been intended for the Military, but it is applicable for all types of business ventures. Despite the fact that the book was written over two thousand years ago, the 13 strategies explained starting from 'Laying Plans' to 'The Use of Spies,' are adoptable for present day management requirements. This little book will open your eyes to very important but quite simple strategies applicable to being a leader.!121!The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an ancient Chinese generals' instructions on war. Having listened to this book left me with feelings of calmness. Everything is strategically and logically explained. I could transfer myself to the ancient world of China and see how they applied all the suggestions. Sort strong, yet calm and thoughtful.!121!Glad to have read this. Becoming more disciplined in what I do. Because I can utilise the ideas anywhere I need to.This book is really short and actually easy to read.But I would say take your time to read it. Far better is to annotate or take notes of what you get from it.✨What it is about:☑️war strategy and planning but the actual scenarios will not be exactly applicable everywhere for everyone ✨How we can apply this book in our lives today:☑️teaches us to think about the unknown but possible scenarios we would face when we are planning for a big change/process ☑️plan out different practical tactics with the resources that would be available to us despite unknown circumstances ☑️keeping a sharp eye on what would hinder/stop/oppose our progress I find this book quite useful. However, as the exact words and scenarios described in the contents are of historical/geographical/war strategies, I had to read the book slowly and seek out what would be applicable for me. Worth the hype? Yes.Is this book for everyone? Yes but it depends on what you are seeking from this book.!121!We all know one person who has an answer for everything. This person is usually annoying and won’t accept that sometimes they’re just wrong; they won’t accept that at some point their logic may fail them and run dry; they’re completely resolute in what they believe and they just won’t budge from it: they simply can’t be proven wrong or at fault. This is how I feel about Sun Tzu. It’s like he interpreted questions and doubts before they were born, and countered them with his own logic based responses that felt immaculately persuasive to the point that I found them to be convincing truths. Sun Tzu, literally, has an answer for everything war based. How to win at war   I could never consider war as a form of art, but Sun Tzu has provided a detailed manual of how to survive it. Well, at least if you’re a general in the command of legions of armies and have the ability to respond to a multitude of situations with the quick thinking advice of Sun Tzu. Then, and only then, might you be ok. If you’re a foot solider or a random underling, then you’re screwed because you’d most likely be spent in some well thought out attack or defensive manoeuvre. This book is certainly one for the generals who must consider victory first and overcome the loss of human life. There’s a reason why this book is still read today by military leaders, soldiers and random bookworms; it provides valuable insight on how to master the battlefield; it advises the reader on how to respond, in the most effective manner, to a number of tactical situations. There is so much covered in this relatively small book that it’s quite surprising. However, despite the convincing nature of his arguments, I do feel like there would be a situation where his logic failed him. There will be a situation where an unforeseeable circumstance defeats his approach and leads in an unexpected defeat and complete rout. No manual of war could ever be completely extensive even if it appears that way. But, don’t tell Sun Tzu I said that because he’d have an answer. Easy to read One thing that struck me when reading this was the sheer approachability of it. I expected it to be very complex and intricate. The manoeuvres and counters are conveyed in a simple, yet comprehensive, manner. It undeniably makes war look easy, which it obviously isn’t. I’m not saying that it’s misleading, but I was just looking for a logic hole in here. I was unable to find one, though I think if someone used this in war they may find it. I am glad of the simplicity of it, though, because it made the book very approachable and easy to understand. I never thought I’d say this, but  The Art of War  is very light reading. This was such an interesting book to read. I feel like I learnt a lot from it, which is quite scary really. Perhaps, I won’t read it a second time, as I don’t want to get to many ideas in my head. I do recommend giving this book a read though, just for the sake of reading something completely different.

Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow (Kindle Edition),Yuval Noah Harari,4.21,247966,2015,"Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future. ","This is a profoundly shocking piece of writing- a tactic which Yuval Noah Harari uses to great effect- aimed at getting readers to think about the now, not just what comes next. Harari’s second book claims to be about the future of mankind, but works more as a means of discussing the state of current trends in science, tech, and human ‘progress’. While he offers suggestions about how things may proceed, the more significant aspect of the book is the way his arguments make us think about how we want things to go- and how we don’t. It's philosophy, not science. That big question that has been posed throughout the ages: how should we live? He makes clear that his hypotheses are only potential futures, but there’s no doubt the text comes across as a warning as much as anything else.For me, the most interesting and thought-provoking was his argument for the better treatment of animals. While we have placed ourselves at the top of the species ladder, new advents in technology may bring about computer technologies which replace us in the number one spot. Considering we may well end up in the unenviable position of the underdog, perhaps we should take more care of those who, like us, may well depend on the goodwill of this higher in the chain. Not only that, modern technology has increasingly allowed us to understand the emotional and intellectual complexity of animals in a way that should make it difficult to treat them as lesser beings. This is an issue that has been playing on my mind for some time. It seems like every week now we are getting news reports of another animal ripped from its habitat for a selfie and dying as a result. Pictures of intensive farming that have animals in cages so small they can't lay down. My social media newsfeed of animals mistreated, dumped, abused, given no more thought than a piece of trash. Harari is a vegan and his specific set of beliefs come across in the text. Yet, as a current meat eater, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify my position. I don't know what to do that can help and the book doesn't offer any concrete plans for change, but it has added another dimension to the considerations I have been struggling with myself.Overall though, it is Harari's style which is the most engaging. I rushed though this book because even the most complex issues are dealt with in accessible language and an approachable tone. It's fun and despite the subject matter, doesn't take itself too seriously. It felt like the starting point of a conversation, somewhat controversial of course, but isn't that the best way to get a debate going?!121!This book reads like the author read a number of popular science articles, watched some sci-fi movies, attended a transhumanist meetup, got just a bit high on weed and then started writing.!121!Harari is a fantastic historian: he writes effortlessly and fascinatingly about historic trends, and has a great big picture perspective of the revolutions and contexts of historical progression.Harari, however, is not a good futurologist and an absolutely terrible cognitive scientist. Being educated in Cognitive Science and technology myself, all I can say, with the utmost respect I can offer to a fellow Israeli, is that he's full of shit.Homo Deus is an attempt to make a sequel to the wildly popular (and actually quite good) ""From Animals into Gods"" - its main thesis is that in the 21st century, liberal humanism would progress into ""techno humanism""; and that humanity's main efforts would be to upgrade humans into some bizarre godlike cyborg entity. He focuses on some aspects of modern progress (e.g. genetic engineering) and extrapolates completely insane uses. An example of a claim that he makes: In the near future, the efforts of medical science would be tuned to upgrading the rich rather than healing the diseases of the poor.His underlying zeal for a hunter gatherer sociological eco-utopia notwithstanding - this is bullshit, and focuses on a remote obscure threat rather than a very real threat that's already here: If there's a threat to modern society from modern medical science, it's is the personalization of medicine, rather than ""upgrades"". That is, drugs would be concocted to be maximally efficient according to a genotype. This is already happening at a very rough scale (for instance, there are drugs that are more effective on people of African American descent) - but in the near future, rather than upgrade themselves, the rich people would simply have far more effective cancer treatment because they'd be able to afford genotyping and personal medicine.If the cyborg-upgrade part sounds to you like a bad synopsis of a Neal Stephenson novel, you're absolutely right. Let's all jack into the Matrix now! Needless to say, the views have the grounding in scientific and research reality that a SciFi fanfic about Kirk banging Uhura has, and it is written with the same brain addling juvenile exuberance.Read the first book of his; avoid the second.!121!Homo ObsoletusThe audacious first act, Sapiens, ended with a wild and apocalyptic prophesy - that the Sapiens were cooking up the next epochal revolution that will overshadow the previous three: the cognitive, agricultural and scientific/industrial revolutions. Home Deus, the second act, is the full exploration of that prophesy. Both Sapiens and Homo Deus are compulsory reading in my book, even though the macro-history presented is plenty vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. But then, it might be better to think of these as works of philosophy and not of history. Just like Sapiens is not a History, Home Deus is not a prophesy, both are explorations. This line can be taken as the transition line that links the first book with the second one:“Having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.”The old enemies of mankind— plague, famine and war—are now under control. Except for the potentially restrictive energy constraint, Sapiens has very little standing in our way now. The result is that the Sapiens are becoming more and more God-like, Harari says, and one is forced to pause and reflect: by any previous standards of our history, are we not already Gods? Have we not already exceeded most wild power fantasies? Well yes, but even more God-like attributes are coming: cheating death and creating new life being primary.And along with this march towards the godlike we are marching towards being machine-like too, as we outsource more and more of our internal algorithms to better data-based external algorithms. And the march is relentless, Homo Deus is taking birth before our eyes. The tomorrow is already upon us, and so forth.However, just like the previous three revolutions that infused the Sapiens with power, this revolution too will come at a price, the price of a ratcheting up of inequality. The new Gods will be the techno-super-rich. BTW, reading Harari is good motivation to work on getting rich faster: he hints at a possibility that anyone who is rich enough to afford it, some 50 years into the future, should be able to buy proxy-immortality. And it will probably be a window that closes quickly, since the super-rich would soon take over the monopoly on immortality. So if you are rich enough at the right point in time, then you can be part of Olympus too. That might not be a deal many would want to miss out on… There is one more catch: as technology takes over most of the functions, even the godlike sapiens will find themselves stuck in a universe devoid of real meaning. Bulk of humanity will have no economic, social or cultural purpose since anything we can do our new creations would be able to do even better. “Organisms are algorithms,” and the new algorithms will be so much better than the imperfect ones we are made of. As Bill Gates asked in his article about the book, “What If People Run Out of Things to Do?” We will be stuck in an immortal meaninglessness, our own creations clearly our betters. We will need a new religion to make sense of all this, since the powerful combo of Humanism+Science will not work in world where the sanctity of being Human has lost meaning. Harari feels that “Dataism” will be the religion that will fill the avoid left by Humanism. The whole of Humanity, the Earth, and maybe the entire Universe will become servants to data - a huge data-processing system, the eternal all-knowing Atman. And serving this goal will be the only meaningful pursuit left for us. Immortal, All-powerful, Obsolete: this is the future of the Sapiens.!121!Homo Deus is not quite as factual and cohesive as Sapiens. It falls into the realm of speculation rather than trying to organise and make sense of the world. Sapiens was fantastic because it was almost like a novelisation of human history. It was dramatic and loaded with exciting revelations about what makes us human. It discussed where we came from and where we are now. It was a thought provoking, an exceedingly intelligent piece of writing. With this book Harari looks to the future, to where we may go and how we may get there. And here Harari’s opinion comes across very strongly. He examines our current practices regarding technology and animals. We advance scientifically, but not emotionally or spiritually. We continue to make the same mistakes as we destroy the natural world and ruin our planet. Like me, Harari is a vegan and he is disgusted with current practice. He does not offer an idealistic view of the future (one a vegan would wish for) but instead discusses what will happen if we continue with our erroneous ways. And for me, this took the book to an entirely new level. It became thoughtful, critical and totally necessary. 

“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

 He looks at animals, about what we truly know about them. They are not so different from us, and the way we treat them is deplorable. I could write essays on this subject; I am beyond bitter about it. I’m angry. I’m frustrated. And above all I am so deeply sad. My heart is broken every day because humanity is so terribly unjust to those it deems beneath them. And here Harari adds another element, he considers what would happen if we became a “lesser” lifeform. With the progress in technology and genetic engineering, it is not to far to suggest that computers could replace us or some form of superhuman. So, in a way, we should not act all high and mighty because one day we may be in a very different situation. I don’t find it too hard to believe.I do not doubt that these two books have the potential to change how you think about the world. They will open your eyes to issues you may never have thought about. They’re not to be missed. _________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________!121!This is a book focusing on the future of humanity.

What I learned from this book 

1) Why poor are following Marie-Antoinette's advice today? 
In 1789 Marie-Antoinette (bride of France's King Louis XVI) told, ""Qu'ils mangent de la brioche""—""Let them eat cake."" when someone told her that French people had no bread. Many people criticized her for this insensible remark. But today, the poor are following this advice ironically.  ""Rich residents of Beverly Hills are eating lettuce, salad, and steamed tofu with quinoa, in the slums and ghettos the poor gorge on twinkie cakes, Cheetos, hamburgers, and pizzas.""  
2) What is more dangerous than terrorism? 
The author tells us that it is not terrorism that is the biggest threat to humankind in the 21st century. He tells us that it is the overreaction to terrorism a much more serious threat. ""Terrorists stage a terrifying spectacle of violence that captures our imagination and makes us feel as if we are sliding back into medieval chaos. Consequently states often feel obliged to react to the theatre of terrorism with a show of security, orchestrating immense displays of force, such as the persecution of entire populations or the invasion of foreign countries. In most cases, this overreaction to terrorism poses a far greater threat to our security than the terrorists themselves.""  
3) Censorship in the 21st century 
Censorship will have a different approach in the 21st century, according to the author.  ""In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the 21st century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. People just don't know what to pay attention to, and they often spend their time investigating and debating side issues""  
4) What is the greatest scientific discovery ever? 
Harari talks about the importance of knowing our limitations and how little we know in this part. “The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realized how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress.""  
 5) The future of ebooks
Harari tells us how the books will change in the future. Along with that, he tells how the incorporation of AI and biometrics will help to understand every human beings reaction when he is reading an ebook ""If Kindle is upgraded with face recognition and biometric sensors, it can know what made you laugh, what made you sad and what made you angry.

My favourite three lines from this book 
 “ Humans are in danger of losing their economic value because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.”
  “If an epidemic nevertheless gets out of control it is due to human competence rather than divine anger..”    ""Religion cannot be equated with superstition, because most people are unlikely to call their cherished beliefs' superstitions'. We always believe in 'the truth'. It’s only other people who believe in superstitions”   
What could have been better?
I'm afraid I have to disagree with the author's opinion that it is ok to enjoy an extramarital affair.

 5/5 This book has the right mixture of science and philosophy to keep it engaging and informative. If you loved the author's earlier book, Sapiens, this would be a good choice to pick.!121!“Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.” ― Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowHarari takes us, with this continuation to his blockbuster book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, from the past to the future. This book shares a lot of the same limitations of the previous book. But because ""speculation"" is inherent in writing about the future, Harari's jumps are easier to forgive when talking about tomorrow than when talking about today. I'm a diabetic and have an insulin pump and I've thought of myself, only partially in jest, as a early, unsophisticated, cyborg the last ten years. I walk around with my iphone plugged into my ears, my artificial pancreas plugged into my thigh, my sensor for my pump plugged into my stomach. It isn't very neat. We have miles to go before all of this technology becomes aesthetically amazing, and loses all the wires and clunky functionality, but it still gives me pause about the future. My friend's Tesla drives by itself, big data seems able to predict what I will buy next, my smart phone really is smart. Perhaps we are all surfing towards some Omega Point. I have a friend who is a Transhumanist and it has been interesting to hear him discuss the values and virtues of Transhumanism. I'm a little more hesitant. I'm no Luddite, but I DO worry about these big technological/cultural/commercial shifts. Will technology make Homo Sapiens the next Homo Neanderthalensis? Will these gains through AI, technology, genetic modification, etc., be well-thought-out? Harari hedges by saying he doesn't know what the future brings (If he did, perhaps we should just join his church), but is only using this discussion to suggest the type of ethical and moral and even survival discussions we SHOULD probably be having. As we incrementally crawl towards some form of technological singularity, perhaps we need to give pause to not just the benefits, but costs of self-driving cars and sex robots.!121!Tongue Firmly in CheekOrThe Mormons Are RightOrEvolution Is So YesterdayOrThe Problems of Prayers AnsweredOrToo Much Good News Is Hard to TakeOrIt Could have Turned Out So Different; But It Didn’t OrAll Thoughts and Feelings Are Algorithms; Except This OneOrFiction Is Our Fundamental Technology; Just Ask Donald TrumpOr The Vital Uncertainty: We Can Have Meaning Or Power in Life But Not Both TogetherAs with his previous book Sapiens, Harari tells a story in Homo Deus that is too disconcerting to summarise, and too captivating to ignore. It is simultaneously arrogant and self-debasing; stimulating and depressing. I can therefore only comment on it by suggesting a series of alternative subtitles. Those noted above only scratch the surface of possibilities. It is the last however that I find most insightful and inspiring to further thought. Perhaps an addendum to this review will be necessary at some point.!121!“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past.”The title and the premise of Yuval Noah Harari’s Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow sounds intriguing; however, not much felt new. I’ve already heard much of the author’s arguments in other places. So while the various topics discussed are interesting and thought-provoking, Homo Deusis mostly provocative because of the way it is packaged. Advancements in a number of fields, especially in relation to data and an increase in our longevity, are examined to make the point that we are reaching a pivotal moment in our history. In order for transformations to be made, the author argues we need to change our mindset and expectations and maybe even our concept about individualism. While the author's arguments may be true, I was hoping to hear more about the future, the tomorrow in Harari’s subtitle, than the past. The final quarter of the book did focus on that tomorrow (what the job market might look like, whether man or some people in the job market might end up being completely superfluous, the future role of AIs in our society etc.), but I would have preferred more of that analysis earlier in the book. I would have also liked something closer to the beginning of the book about how important algorithms would be in that analysis. 3.5 stars.!121!This is a powerful book by a truly insightful author. I recently read Harari's previous great book, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and I enjoyed this one just as much. There is so much packed into Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, that it is hard to do justice to the book in a review. Yuval Harari has such a unique insight into how the world turns. He is sometimes very blunt, but he ""tells it like he sees it."" The first two-thirds of the book is devoted to a description of how the humanist philosophy developed, while the last third is about how humanism may very well fall to the wayside in the not-too-distant future.In the beginning of the book, Harari describes two new human agendas. The first is how humans attempt to extend their lifetimes, and the second is to increase happiness. The goal is to upgrade homo sapiens into homo deus. That is, the desire to re-engineer our bodies and minds, escape old age, death and misery. Basically, to attain divinity. Harari gives numerous examples of how were technologies developed to aid ill or handicapped people, and then were borrowed to help ""normal"" healthy people; prosthetics, bionics, Viagra, memory aid drugs, plastic surgery, and genetic engineering. (In 2000, a baby girl was born with genetic inheritance from three parents; nuclear genes from mother and father, and mitochondrial DNA from another woman! A year later, the U.S. government banned this special treatment, but the U.K. has since approved it.)Harari contends that historians study the past, not in order to repeat it, or to foretell the future, but to be liberated from it. He gives a marvelous example of the history of the grass lawn. He writes that the best reason to study history is not to predict the future, but to ""free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies.""Harari has some interesting insights into the founding of modern religions. He writes that they were founded when humans switched from hunting/foraging to agriculture. A central point of the religions was to give humans dominion over all animals, in order to justify their domestication and superiority, and to justify the terrible suffering humans cause for animals. The agricultural revolution was both an economic and a religious revolution, used to justify brutal exploitation of animals. Agricultural societies also started treating some classes of people as property. I wonder, though, didn't pre-agricultural societies practice slavery? When I try to do some simple online research in this subject, it seems like Harari might be correct; slavery was established to mimic the domestication of animals. And, the agricultural revolution was bad for humans in other ways, as well. A peasant in 1850 in China or Britain had a worse life than an archaic hunter-gatherer, from the point of view of diet and hygiene.Harari has some unique insights into the dichotomy between religion and science. He describes science as a new ""religion"" that replaced theist religions with humanist religions, replacing gods with humans. The hatred of monotheists for the theory of evolution is inspired by the lack of scientific evidence for a human soul. A soul has no parts, and evolution operates through incremental changes to various parts of a whole. But, both religion and science, in theory at least, are both devoted to the truth. But since their truths are different they seem doomed to clash. However, since neither religion nor science really care much about truth, they can coexist. Religion is mostly interested in social order and structure, while science is mostly interested in power. That is, the power to cure disease, fight war and produce food. So, since religion and science prefer order and power over truth, they ""make good bedfellows.""Modernity is a simple deal based on a contract: Humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. Plagues, droughts and wars have no cosmic meaning to modern humanism, but we have the power to eradicate them. Paradise does not await us after death, but we have the power, in principle, to create paradise here on Earth. Modernity is based on the belief that growth is essential. Growth is the supreme value. Because avarice and greed help to fuel growth, they are encouraged. Traditional religions offer no alternative to liberalism because they are reactive instead of creative. This wasn't always true. During the Middle Ages, Christian monasteries were among the most advanced centers for innovations--Harari lists a number of their innovations. But today religions look to scriptures for answer. But scriptures are no longer a source of creativity, as they say nothing about modern technologies such as genetic engineering or artificial intelligence. Harari describes three different possible futures for humanism. In one of these, liberalism may die out as technology displaces humans. The masses will lose their economic and military importance. Harari suggests that ""Dataism"" may appear as a new religion. Dataism advances the first truly new value in nearly 200 years; the value of freedom of information. Dataism is firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines, computer science and biology. Organisms are seen by scientists as data-processing systems. The stock market is the most powerful of all data processing systems, and centralized government is one of the worst. Capitalism defeated Communism during the Cold War, not because it is more ethical or because individual liberties are sacred, but because in times of rapid technological change, distributed processing systems work better than centralized systems.Humanists rely on feelings to make important decisions, and these feelings evolved over millions of years. But often our feelings are just irrational and wrong. Computer algorithms can surpass feelings in making good decisions. So, the humanist recommendation to ""get in touch with your feelings"" may not he given in the future. Perhaps, meaning in life will not lie in our experiences, until they are shared with others, through social media. And, these social media will analyze our experiences, and be able to give expert advice on important decisions. Harari gives some pretty good evidence that this trend may come to pass.I do want to quibble with some numbers that Harari proposes. He writes that the one billion cars owned around the world could be reduced to 50 million, if they were jointly owned and operated autonomously. People could share rides. However, people want to commute to work in cars all at the same time. They sit in parking lots at work and at home because people have no need for them during work hours and overnight. But this is perhaps a minor point in Harari's argument. Many people will pooh-pooh much of what Harari has to say. But, it is all extremely thought-provoking. I have just scratched the surface of this book. I highly recommend it to all open-minded people who are not afraid to think a bit differently about the meaning of life, about our political structures, and the future.!121!Dacă ne încredem în cifrele oferite de edituri și librării, Homo Deus este bestseller-ul ultimilor trei ani în materie de non-fiction. Care a fost și este, la urma urmelor, secretul autorului?Aș răspunde precum urmează:1. Harari are o evidentă abilitate narativă. Poate povesti chestiuni abstracte și complicate mai curgător, mai puțin împiedicat decît oamenii de știință și filosofii. Știe să explice mai bine decît Galen Strawson, să zicem, și, oricum, mai bine decît neurologii, de ce noțiunea de „responsabilitate” a devenit caducă, de ce liberul arbitru al omului este o venerabilă iluzie etc. Harari a preluat ideile, le-a rescris în felul lui, le-a „vulgarizat” un pic și a vîndut milioane de exemplare. În schimb, cărțile filosofilor zac în rafturile librăriilor. Așadar, abilitate narativă.2. Harari are fler și îndrăzneală. Chestiunile discutate de el nu sînt noi. Homo Deus nu e prima carte despre moarte, fericire, sensul vieții, libertate, hazard și ceea ce trebuie să facă omul pentru a fi mulțumit de el însuși și de cei din jur. Anual se tipăresc zeci de cărți despre sens, fericire, plăcere și moarte (a omului, a lui Dumnezeu, a universului). Flerul lui Harari se vădește în faptul că alege din suma răspunsurilor la o problemă (pentru că libertatea, sensul, moartea sînt și probleme, măcar în mintea înțelepților) ipoteza cea mai radicală. Harari alege, așadar, scandalosul: fericirea înseamnă plăcere și plăcerea e un flux de senzații. Senzațiile pot fi dirijate chimic. În consecință, fericirea se poate obține luînd cîte o pilulă de Zoloft la fiecare 3 ore. Fericirea nu e în ceruri: depinde, prin urmare, de progresul farmacologiei.Postulatul tacit care stă la baza cărții lui Yuval Noah Harari este, desigur, următorul: „Știința va rezolva totul. Omul (dacă există om, nu uitați, căci omul e numai o sumă de algoritmi biochimici) mai are o șansă. Trebuie să sperăm...”. Cititorul se cade a termina de citit cartea într-o dispoziție optimistă.În încheiere, voi oferi 3 citate:- „Cuvîntul sacru 'libertate' se dovedeşte a fi, exact la fel ca 'sufletul', un termen găunos, lipsit de orice înţeles decelabil. Liberul arbitru există doar în poveştile imaginare pe care le-am inventat noi, oamenii” (p.252).- „Cine sînt eu? Ştiinţa subminează nu numai credinţa liberală în liberul arbitru, ci şi credinţa în individualism” (p.256).- Și chestia cea mai tare: „Un studiu recent cerut de Facebook, rivalul companiei Google, a arătat că astăzi algoritmul Facebook judecă deja mai bine personalităţile şi dispoziţiile oamenilor decît prietenii, părinţii şi chiar partenerii lor de viaţă” (p.297).!121!Excellent again. Harari is fast becoming one of my favourite writers.I didn't love  Homo Deus quite as much as  Sapiens, but I think that's because the history Harari takes us through in the latter really does read like a very compelling novel. This book explores different themes and theories about the future of humanity - relating to aging, technological advancements, etc. - which makes it not as cohesive. Still, though, very interesting. He really knows how to break down complex concepts so everyone can understand them.!121!The book is hugely disappointing. A year or so ago I read an interview with Harari on this book, which was still work in progress, and I found his views on biological inequality (and, to a lesser extent, the decoupling of intelligence from consciousness) very insightful. Actually, it was that interview that inspired me to read Sapiens, which, despite certain flaws, unfortunately amplified in Deus, is a book definitely worth reading. Meanwhile, Deus is wordy, chaotic and repetitive; most of the book is a just hotchpotch of quite basic facts stretching across many disciplines that does not seem to serve any purpose. A portion of that is a repetition from Sapiens, but most sounds like extended paragraphs from high school textbooks which are intended – I guess – to support each chapter’s main claim, but fail to do so, as they are not inserted in any kind of persuasive argumentation. Despite most of the book’s being redundant, I have to say I appreciated Harari’s insights on free will. Had I not read about biological inequality before, I’d probably also somewhat praise that part. If I hadn’t read Sapiens, I could have liked the parts already discussed in Sapiens (but if you haven't read Sapiens, just read Sapiens). But I'm afraid that's all. Really disappointing, I honestly wanted to give up on this book at least three times, but ploughed through it, including notes, anyway, because I hoped I'd discover something of real value in the end. Didn’t happen.!121!Obviously I need to get a copy of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind because I loved this book. I can't claim to be well-read in the topic of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, so I'm definitely biased in my opinion that Harari is a genius. Every few pages my copy has lengthy passages highlighted, brilliant bits I just knew I would want to reference when I pitched this book to family and friends later on. In Homo Deus, Harari holds that now that humanity has all but solved the mammoth problems plaguing it before the 21st century - disease, famine, and violence - it will turn to a new agenda, namely attaining happiness, immortality, and divinity. This is what the blurb will tell you, but the book addresses many more topics beyond the above. The author writes about our potential future in terms of our recent and ancient past (he is, after all, first and foremost a historian). He explains how humans distinguished themselves from the animal world and came to recognize the human experience and economic growth as the ultimate powers of the recent centuries. Harari then turns to look at where the unstoppable tide of technology and progress may take us in a few decades - whether intelligent algorithms and a genetically upgraded superhuman elite may make ordinary humans obsolete. His ideas, put starkly, may sound like far-fetched science fiction, but Harari supports his assertions with historical and current evidence as well as deep insights that make his predictions seem chillingly close to prophecy. Even though he states that Homo Deus is meant to help readers explore all possible future routes of humankind, the book still induced an ominous feeling in me the whole way. One of my favorite passages concerns the belief in a potential scientific ""Noah's Ark"" which will deliver the rich and social elite from detrimental future effects of climate change, leaving the poor masses to deal with the fallout: 
Even if bad comes to worse and science cannot hold off the deluge, engineers could still build a hi-tech Noah's Ark for the upper caste, while leaving billions of others to drown. The belief in this hi-tech Ark is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of humankind and of the entire ecosystem. People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who belive in a heavenly afterlife should not be given nuclear weapons.
 Touché.And one of the best ""food for thought"" snippets, in a chapter discussing (among other things) the moral implications of farming animals: 
If and when computer programs attain superhuman intelligence and unprecedented power, should we begin valuing these programs more than we value humans? Would it be okay, for example, for an artificial intelligence to exploit humans and even kill them to further its own needs and desires? If it should never be allowed to do that, despite its superior intelligence and power, why is it ethical for humans to exploit and kill pigs?
All that being said, the book does have a tendency to ramble a bit. Harari hammers his main points into the reader through numerous repetitions and returns. There are 50 page chapters in Homo Deus, elaborating on and illustrating one single-sentence argument. However, lots of the evidence the author presents is interesting in itself - often it was a historical case applicable to current events - so it never gets boring.!121!بخش‌هایی از این کتاب با کتاب

زيرا مسيحيت، اسلام و آئين هندو، با پافشاری بر اين که معنای وجود ما وابسته به سرنوشت ما بعد از مرگ است، بـه مــرگ همچـون بخشــی اساسی و مثبت از جهان می‌نگريستند. انسان‌ها از اين رو می‌مردند کــه خداونــد مقــرر می‌کرد و لحظه‌ی مرگ يک تجربه‌ی مقدس ماوراء طبيعی بود که با معنا مشتعل می‌شــد. وقتی انسانی نفس آخر خود را می‌کشيد، زمان فراخواندن کشيش و خاخـام و شـامان بود، تا با زندگی تسويه حساب کنند و نقش حقيقی فرد در حال احتضار در کائنات را به جان بپذيرند. آيا می‌توانيد مسيحيت، اسلام يـا آئين هنـدو را بـدون مـرگ- کـه جهانی است بدون بهشت و جهنم يا زندگی ديگر ـ تصور کنيد؟ علم و فرهنگ نوين برداشتی کاملا متفاوت از مرگ و زندگی دارند. اينها مرگ را به عنوان يک راز ماوراء طبيعی نمی‌انگارند و قطعا آن را سرچشمه‌ی زندگی نمی‌پندارند. مرگ از نظر انسان‌های نوين مشکلی فنی است، که می‌تواند و بايد حل شود. ص 38 کتابوودی آلن، که از موضوع ترس از مرگ موقعيت خارق العـاد‌‌ای را بـرای خـود بـه وجود آورده بود، زمانی مورد سؤال قرار گرفت که آيا زندگی ابدی بـر پـرده‌ی نقـره‌ای را آرزو می‌کند. آلن در جواب گفت: ""ترجيح می‌دادم کـه در آپارتمـانم زنـدگی کنم"". او ادامه داد: ""نمی‌خواهم از طريق حرفه‌ی خود به زندگی جاويد برسم. می‌خواهم با نمردن به آن برسم"". شکوه ابدی، ادای تشريفات يادبود وطن پرستی و آرزوی رفتن به بهشت موعود برای انسان‌هايی مانند آلن، که به واقع خواستار نمردن هستند، گزينه‌هـای غـيرجذابی هستند. ص 50 کتاب اما علم می‌گويد که کسی هرگز با گرفتن ترفيع، برنده شـدن در بخت آزمـايی يـا حتی يافتن

additional informative knowledge and intriguing speculations told in an engaging and thought-provoking style.

“People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.”

I will first say that Harari is a good writer, he really knows how to make interesting topics more compelling and he also kept me focused on information that would’ve been boring to read usually. Frankly speaking, there were indeed some sections in Part II—liberalism—that in my opinion was super dull and dry to read, but Part 1 and Part 3 of the book was superb; I found the majority of my attention grabbed by the way Harari discussed topics that evidently relevant in our society. Unlike Homo Sapiens which mostly dealt with facts and how humanity progressed—or stay the same—from the past up to the present, in Homo Deus Harari tells and speculates what comes after; what kind of futures humanity might be facing or going for based on the data and theories gathered from our history and present timeframe. There are so many topics that I could talk about here, but I feel like talking too much would diminish the benefit of reading this book itself; I’ll refrain from doing that and gives a bit of my opinion regarding one of the topics discussed: the power and curses of social media.

“In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. [...] In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.”

The passage above speaks a loud volume to the way humanity lives these days. You want to know about something? Search it on Google. You want to see beautiful places you’ve never been to or bookish pictures? Search it on Instagram. Do you want to learn how to do something? Search it on Youtube or Pinterest. Book reviews? Search it on Goodreads/Amazon. There are many more examples, but the conclusion is that we live in an era where we have incredibly easy access to information that wasn’t possible to gain more than a decade ago. There’s no doubt that internet and social media have changed the way we live completely and there’s simply no going back from here. I’ve seen and heard some people complained about the way their privacy and data are used, and yes, their reasons are valid and I do believe that privacy of each individual should be respected. But this isn’t actually a hard-to-find knowledge; majority of social media users know that they’re giving away their data when they used their applications. Knowing all the risk of data sacrificial, we arrive at the most important question:Will we/they continue to use the applications? Most likely yes, the convenience and strength given by social media are simply way too powerful to ignore. I don’t have many issues against social media; most of my lives are enriched because of it. you’re reading this—and my other—review through social media, after all. However, it truly saddens me to see how many people have their lives destroyed by social media. Depression is at an all-time high; jealousy sparked easily; we constantly feel unsatisfied by what we have because of the beauty and unrealistic expectations set by filtered lenses.

“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon.”

The heavy reliance on social media usage might be responsible for many issues these days, honestly speaking, though, I personally don’t think that social media should take the blame entirely. It’s easier said than done, but internet/social media should be treated with the same rule of drinking alcohol: use it responsibly and it has a chance of bringing you happiness instead of harm/problems. Anything that’s too much is never good and that notion applies here, on our way to increase our quality of life by becoming a user of internet/social media, the opposite happens when we’re not in control: social media doesn’t become the product we use, WE become the social media’s product.

“Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.”

There are still many more words I could write regarding this topic, but this is a book review and I plan to keep it that way. Please don’t take the long paragraphs I wrote about data, social media, and internet as a way of me saying that these are the only prominent topics that Harari talked about, there were still many other VERY important topics such as food, history, human dominance, belief, and religions that Harari elaborated with effectiveness, but I think it would be better for you to read them for yourself.

“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

Overall though, despite finding this book interesting and engaging, I still think that Homo Sapiens is the superior book. Now, I have no idea whether it’s due to Homo Sapiens being the first book I read instead of Homo Deus or not, but it really felt like some of the discussions and ideas gets repetitive to read. Plus, I had mixed feelings regarding Part 2 of the book where a lot of sections were uninteresting and told in an almost text-book manner. Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow is a thought-provoking book about societies, dataism, humanism, and the power of beliefs. As always, my rating speaks more for enjoyment rather than technicality, and I honestly believe that this, and Homo Sapiens, are books that should be read at least once whether you enjoy them or not. I agree and don’t agree with Harari on several topics, but the reasonings he gave will most likely make you reflect on many important topics.

“Fiction isn't bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or corporations, no complex human society can function. We can't play football unless everyone believes in the same made-up rules, and we can't enjoy the benefits of markets and courts without similar make-believe stories. But stories are just tools. They shouldn't become our goals or our yardsticks. When we forget that they are mere fiction, we lose touch with reality. Then we begin entire wars `to make a lot of money for the cooperation' or 'to protect the national interest'. Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; why do we find ourselves sacrificing our life in their service.”

The insights were generally already well presented in the earlier book. The section on animal lives is not convincingly warranted for inclusion but more obviously just a passion for the author leading me to feel I was being preached too. His criticism of Dawkins et al although correct could be equally pointed at himself. The universe will move from hot to cold regardless of quantum mechanical randomness at the quanta scale and equally at our barely greater scale (in universal terms) the path of the universe need not worry about human probabilistic behaviour, our free will is irrelevant to the progress of the universe. The fact that it is buried in our consciousness where language based thought is absent is hardly surprising as without it we could never have arrived at language based thought.All living things will die (even if capable of life spans we can't comprehend now) something terminal eventually happens to everything. As finally when the universe is so cold nothing can happen, long after this proton decay will plant the last nail in all coffins. Dr Hariri is no different to a WW1 general asking people to sacrifice some of their one and only life to benefit some unknown present or future person or animal with zero guarantees the sacrifice pays off but 100% certainty of the personal cost. Technology won't replicate humans, why would anyone want to copy such an imperfect organism when so many better options would be available?He admits, to paraphrase Dr King, that the arc of history is towards justice. The future is not a destination we choose any effort to dictate global outcomes never succeeds and this book is just another ""I know best contribution"" that will soon be forgotten.Generally the book feels as a world view supported selectively and not the wonderful voyage of discovery presented in Sapiens. Like Dawkins hating God though not believing, the author to object to humanism sneers at humans. No one ever said humans should act justly towards anything as a result of evolution but wth curiosity, generosity and empathy we have achieved a lot and are headed to achieve more although doomed anyway either in the long or short term. He fails completely to demonstrate any logic for a human that is mortal caring the exact length of time left to the species and acting altruistically as a result, and so totally unaware his action would have a measurable affect. If Mr Schickelbach hadn't changed his name to Hitler how different would the 20th century have been? What is the possibility of picking out causal events like these or knowing preventing them offers a better present. Everyone alive today must selfishly accept all of the great or horrible past or simply not exist.I'm happy I read it just a little deflated that so little eye opening left field explanations are in it and so many unsupported claims are made.To sum up he reminds me of the experimenter that forgets he is part of the experiment and can never not be.!121!Thought provoking and sweepingHistorians study the past not in order to repeat it but in order to be liberated from it.General observationsWe become satisfied when reality confirms with our expectationsYuval Noah Harari is on par with the best SF writers in painting a broad picture of long term trends and their impact. He posits that human development is pivoting from fighting famine, plague and war and that the big narrative and goals of the 21st century are to ""upgrade"" humanity into immortality, happiness and divinity. The topics he take on are gigantic and my thoughts about the book are quite expansive as well.Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow despite its title, spends a lot of time on the question of how we got to our modern day world. This history focus in itself is not a problem, since the way the author paints a picture is still as strong as in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.Actually I feel the future predictions are not necessarily the strongest point of the book.The paragraph about how we conquered plagues (The era that humankind stands helplessly versus natural epidemics is probably over) is a bit awkward while sitting on the brink of a second Corona lockdown, despite we are not in black death toll proximity yet. Also the narrative on less war is partly true but fails to pick up fully on trade tensions and cyber attacks that were also brewing in 2016. Finally I feel that climate change and equality should be themes coming back as major challenges for the 21st century.Still the tale Harari tells is very compelling.Immortality, happiness and divinityIt’s hard work to be happyThe author starts of with the thought provoking thought that already in many ways we modern day humans surpass Greek or Hindu gods, for instance in speed of travel or in access to information. There are no clear line separates healing from upgrading in biotechnology, hence Harari states that we will tap into the potential of bio engineering and nano technology to increase livespans. How far we can go in this respect is unclear. Ray Kurzweil techno utopia of immortality is probably further away then a few decades, but new knowledge leads to novel behavior, the more we know, the less well we can forecast accurately. How will development of AI influence nanotechnology and the other way around for instance? The second priority, happiness, is intimately tied to furthering our understanding of human biochemistry. Here some of the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding of the mind start to become more apparent (and you start to understand how progressive Buddha was in respect to trying to steer away from the chasing of pleasant sensations). Since luxury and newness wear of quickly, a radical increase in human happiness is probably only possible through a deeper understanding of the ""hardware"" of the brain. What is free will? Can you choose your desires and preferences? I don’t choose my desires, I just feel them and act upon them.Computer chips to cure depression with electrical charges in the brain are possibly only a first step,transcranial stimulators and other tech can help us understand better the relation between the brain and the mind.And this leads to the third topic, and in my perspective the most pivotal part of the book, humanity's relation with divinity. With technology massive upgrades in our capabilities are possible, probably firstly for the rich. But this in itself is not as interesting as what really differentiates humans from other animals and especially computers, if these keep developing in capabilities.Towards a real life Matrix?Intelligence is decoupling from consciousnessThe author dives into the relation between the advent of agriculture and monotheistic religions, that emphasize our species unique status amongst animals, as opposed to animistic earlier religions. How when we discovered we descended from animals (evolution theory) the power of religion decreased, is a very interesting parallel I never thought of early.Here the author starts to zoom into the differences between humans and animals, and what is the mind. Harari states that intersubjectivity is our superpower, how we can think of mental constructs that are believed in, and are used as overlay of reality for a large amount of Homo Sapiens, to facilitate cooperation. Useful fictions that enable us to cooperate with unknown and unrelated specimens of our kind.Like for instance gods, nations, money, and how no other species has shown this capability.He then show how these fictions shape reality, like borders drawn haphazardly over Africa by European powers are still creating tensions in the current day world.Also the power of writing to enable the rise of empire, making it possible to track much more means and property than before, when only a human mind could be used to keep records, is fascinating.This all leads Harari to define Humanism as a kind of religion, a fiction that became useful when universal conscription by nations came into vogue. The main tenets of Humanism are then looked into by Harari, for instance that individual human experience and emotion should act as a basis of current day ethics and policies. And how the realisation of life sciences show that animals, and hence humans, are algorithms, dangerously undermines this core belief.And if intelligent algorithms, run by computers, perform better than humans, what then is the defining characteristic of humanity?Transhumanism?Disconnection will mean deathTopics like can it suffer and fictions versus reality and the narrating self versus experiencing self in how humans experience the outside world, come back in the last part of Homo Deus. Harari envisions that these biological insights and technological developments will lead to a new narrative, wherein humans either need to upgrade, try to merge with the singularity, or become redundant like Neanderthals.A lot of questions rise with me from this part, mainly: Who would want such a future, wherein we humans are irrelevant, and why hence would we work towards such a thing?Who wants the Matrix to be real?I feel that Harari missed the opportunity to discuss Capitalism as a kind of religion. The quest for ever more returns literarily opens the Pandora’s box that Hariri discusses. We have not applied mass GMO, we can safeguard privacy with GDPR, big tech’s dominion is not inevitable. We can think about the question if economic growth is more important than human family ties. And can a algorithm be a consumer?Human beings are stubborn and unpredictable and I doubt that algorithms truly know us better than we know ourselves. In a sense even if this is true, when you know you are being observed your behaviour would change, like how in Foundation from Isaac Asimov the subject of predictions must not be aware of the expectations, for otherwise the predicted outcomes would change.Anyhow, this is a highly readable and very much thought provoking book, that hopefully kicks off a debate about the kind of future we want to realize, instead of being just a prophecy of how humankind painted itself into a corner. I know our current record on these kind of topics is not good (see climate change) but feel the thoughtful and provocative thinking of authors like Yuval Noah Harari will help in starting these kind of necessary conversations. Highly recommended!!121!Que livro amigos, que livro. Não lembro do que li que me fez pensar tanto e mudar a forma como vejo o mundo. Uma ótima análise rápida sobre como chegamos aqui, que se conecta muito bem com o Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, e uma análise mais extensa sobre para onde podemos ir. A análise em terceira pessoa sobre humanismo, capitalismo e tendências futuras é excelente. E a reflexão que ele traz sobre os valores que damos para o valor individual, consciência e autonomia só deve ganhar importância nos próximos anos. E tudo isso em uma linguagem acessível e ao alcance de qualquer audiência. Com certeza algo que vou reler muito ainda.p.s. O livro sai em alguns meses ainda, tive a oportunidade de fazer a revisão técnica da versão em português.!121!Where do you start reviewing a colossal piece of work such as Homo Deus – A Brief History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari? Last year I read another work by this author Sapiens, I was so taken by that work I could have and should have given it 6 stars (rule breaker, I am – yes I live on the edge). Sapiens discussed how we got to where we are now, Homo Deus discusses where we could be heading. To be honest it isn’t pretty – not to me anyway.Professor Harari explains how Homo Sapiens have conquered the world and everything in it – including the atrocious way we arrogantly treat animals and the way we believe we are inherently more valued and important than other beings such as pigs, cows, fish, lizards, bugs and all.What makes the life of domesticated farm animals particularly miserable is not the way they die. But the way they live.This humble (but quite opinionated and annoying) reader believes he is no more important in the grand scheme of things than my Pup, a Pig, a Sparrow, a Fly, a Kettle or a Coffee Table – we are all part of the intricate exchange of atoms and matter that started 14 Billion years ago (perhaps). To be honest, believing this gives me great comfort and peace. That is, my carbon-based body, which may end up expired at some time sooner rather than later, will exchange atoms, molecules, and various other sub-atomic particles with Mother Earth. I love that. The author states the ‘fact’ we have eternal Souls - apparently this means we take precedence over beings such as a pig, who don’t have souls.. This seems to give Homo Sapiens, more sway in the way things are managed, and imagined. As an aside, there is Zero evidence Humans have souls as there is zero evidence Pigs have souls. I really like the way Harari describes concepts such as Objective Reality, like gravity (which is indisputably real) and Inter-Subjective Reality (which are human constructs), such as religion and money. I can’t argue with the power of the latter regarding its contribution in the way we have totally dominated this planet.The author repeatedly quotes statistics and numbers, and as this is an audiobook, I did find it difficult to re-read, stop, and check references if I needed to. However, one classic is – only 14% of Americans believe humans evolved without any divine intervention at all. What? Really? Apparently, being college/university educated makes no difference to these numbers. It’s funny (not) how the Theory of Evolution attracts far more criticism and controversy than the Theory of Relativity, which seems to go unnoticed. People don’t really give a toss about space/time and if they’re interrelated, but don’t talk about evolution.The author discusses so many topics here such as Humanism, Liberalism, Climate Change, Poverty – the difference between poor and rich. Harari spends a great deal of time discussing Humanism. This is a non-theist philosophy which affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfilment. In other words, we can give shape to our own lives, using free-will, learning from our experiences and so forth. He then goes onto discuss ‘free-will’ – and the fact we may not be as free as we think. For example, we already have many automated algorithms collecting data on each of us to influence what we buy, want, need. In fact, I finished this section believing ‘the system’ knows me better than I know myself!What will happen if we realise customers and voters never make free choices?The confrontation-o-meter really starts to crank up when the author writes about us being replaced by A.I. Algorithms. A future of machines with no-consciousness making decisions using vast amounts of data, thus making us superfluous. It seems we are on the verge of massive changes in this area – if we all think about it, the rate of change in the last decade has already been massive, as we know rates of technological change seem to increase exponentially . It’s very frightening.Apparently, experts find it difficult to tell the difference between computer generated music, poetry – there are many professions we previously thought were exempt from automation. Taking The Family Doctor for example, an A.I. GP would always be up to date with the latest journals, papers, diagnoses, medications – for every disease imaginable, in real-time. How can a human compete with that? This is just one very simple example.In closing, this whole read was fascinating. I loved it, in an itchy sort of way. But you know, there is one major thing missing from this whole automated algorithmic data-driven world. What about love – how can a machine ever do that? Grief also? Desires? Maybe the world doesn’t need this – I don’t know about you, but a world without the things that make us human – love, grief, emotions, desires, sounds like no world at all.5 Stars!121!3.5 Niestety nieco mniej mi się podobała niż „Sapiens”. Nie można jej odmówić ogromu przekazanej wiedzy i wielu bardzo ciekawych poruszonych tematów, ale ogółem jako książka - nieco mi się dłużyła. Było dużo powtórzeń, bardzo duzo religii i wiary jak na książkę o naukach ścisłych (co samo w sobie nie jest minusem, ale mnie zaskoczyło). Mogę ją z czystym sumieniem polecić, ale jednak na początek, lepiej zacząć od mojego uwielbianego „Sapiensa”. Jest mimo wszystko ciekawszy :)!121!Harari is excellent at the big picture stuff. Here he continues with the analysis he began in Sapiens, projecting it into the future.As we saw in the earlier book, the thing he thinks makes us unique as a species is our ability to create stories and then act as though those stories are true. This makes them true, bringing into being an intersubjective story-based reality that lets large numbers of people cooperate effectively and create large societies constructed around that reality. One of the most important kinds of story is a religion. Harari takes a broad view of what religions are, and argues that an effective religion needs to be in tune with the technology of its society. Traditional religions like Christianity are adapted to an agricultural society; Jehovah runs Earth the way a farmer runs his farm, and when everyone is a farmer this is a natural image. But since the industrial revolution, most of us are no longer farmers. Harari says that the traditional religions have since then been in practice supplanted by what he calls the ""humanist"" religions: liberalism, communism, nazism, etc. As the label suggests, these put people, rather than God, in the centre of the picture. He makes his analysis look insightful and appealing, and there are many fine throwaway lines: I particularly liked the characterisation of WW II as the largest religious war to date.Now, however, we are rapidly leaving the industrial age and entering the information age. More and more, people turn over decision making to the machines, because they do it better. So what people think becomes less relevant, data stored and processed by various kinds of AIs becomes more relevant, and people can no longer be in the centre. Harari extrapolates logically that this is rapidly creating new religions where information is central instead. This does indeed seem a good way to think about books like Tegmark's Life 3.0: I certainly read it as a piece of proselytising, even if I couldn't at the time name what it was proselytising for. Harari's ""dataism"" now seems like a useful word. Verily, I say unto ye, ye must become as one with the data, that thy soul shall reach the heavens in the more perfect bodies of the machines which are our brethren. Though one of the things which irritates me about dataism is that its sacred language in fact seems to be modern Californian.The really terrifying thing about the dataist future, which each month sounds less like science-fiction and more like the world we see around us, is that it may be the least bad alternative. Both in this book and in Elise Bohan's Future Superhuman, which I started reading yesterday, they keep returning to the depressing point that we human beings no longer seem able to control the world we've created and are rapidly destroying it. Maybe there is no way back, only a way forward into this uncharted new territory.!121!An incredible book about the future. Intelligence or consciousness?You can anticipate and forecast the future now.!121!We are not so taken aback when we hear computer programs can beat human chess masters. After all, computers are far more efficient calculators than humans, and chess can be broken down to calculations (In fact, nowadays chess masters don't stand a chance against present day computer Chessmaster programs. It's simply not possible for a human mind to beat them). And we're also not at all shocked when Google and Tesla present us automated cars driven by computer programs. Nevertheless, we reason,computers can never rival humans in arts, because arts require something distinctively(perhaps even spiritually) humane, which can never be replicated by computers. If you're a believer in this sort of human distinctiveness, perhaps you would naturally be thrown off upon hearing that a computer program written by a professor of musicology produced musical piece that the audience thought was superior to Bach. In other words, AI has already passed the Turing test in music. If programs can outperform us in our allegedly distinct 'human art' form, there's really no reason to think that it can't outperform us in every other field. Programs may lack subjective consciousness like us, but that doesn't stop them to outperform us in intellectual and artistic fields. Harari's new book explores the dimensions of the marriage between man and machine. He basically paints a dystopian vision of the future where humanity is by and large subjugated to non conscious intelligent machines. He even entertains the idea with the rise of brain-machine interfaces, where today's elite class of human beings would upgrade themselves to a biologically improved version of humans, which the general mass couldn't possibly afford for their lives. This would create a real caste system with real biological hierarchies. After reading Harari's previous book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, I must say that I am a bit disappointed with this book. Much of the book is reiteration of the previous book which seemed to me largely redundant. However, although this book is not as articulated or entertaining as the previous one, it is probably more important, considering the topics it deals with.!121!Mind-blowing! What an interesting, compelling, thought-provoking and, yeah, kind of scary book. After finishing it, I'm both elated and anxious.Homo Deus (what a perfect title) was complex and it covered a lot of things, but it is especially trying to decipher where the humanity is going.Consciousness, the individual, intelligence, and the very important ability to organise are thoroughly analysed.I was very surprised to have my native country mentioned and analysed briefly but comprehensively. More importantly, Harari answered a question I've been asking myself for many years. In retrospect, the explanation is logical but it never occurred to me and nobody else was able to enlighten me either. Algorithms - a modern word, but very important, as we all are biological algorithms.What's more important - intelligence or consciousness?I also enjoyed the recap/rundown of some historical events in history. Harari also addresses our cruel treatment of farm animals. I'm an omnivore who feels guilty. What else? There's a lot to take in, but Harari unpacks it for us in an eloquent, easy to understand manner (well, I understood it). I'll probably buy the paperback so I go over certain chapters again.This audiobook was splendidly narrated by Derek Perkins.Highly recommended!121!Outlier Review Alert!I don't what is it about Harari's books that always inspire food metaphors in me. With Sapiens, it was masala chai vs. coffee. This time, it is an Eid special, as this review is coming to you on Eid! Wanna know more? Read on!Imagine being served a scrumptious biryani. Everything smells great and looks great. But when you start eating it, you realise that the meat (sorry, vegetarians!) isn't upto the mark and has been left raw in some places. No matter how flavourful the rest of the biryani is, the meat has spoiled its entire taste. To me, that is Homo Deus in a nutshell.Homo Deus literally means ""Man God"", man trying to be God. Part 1 of the book talks about man dominating animals in order to emerge as a superior species. In Part 3, Harari dexterously covers humankind's attempts to govern the world with their technological advancements. But what would happen if technology attempts to dominate us tomorrow? (Or has it already begun?) That is also covered in depth and is slightly scary too. You might just end up becoming a bit paranoid after reading this last section. I really enjoyed these two parts of the book (speaking only in a broad sense; there were some flaws in here as well.) But the second part left me utterly irritated.Part 2 talks about various forms of religion, both actual and assumed. Harari includes Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Liberalism, Communism, Aryanism, Capitalism, Humanism,.. all under the umbrella tag of religion. How these ""religions"" impacted human decision towards progress or towards disaster, how religious dogmas affected human thinking and human freedom, how collective belief in a particular religion restricted human progress - everything is detailed out based on Harari's presumptions. And this is where he falters badly.Harari claims that past religious interpretations cannot be judged currently as technology wasn't the same at the time and human consciousness develops with time. And yet, he ends up doing this consistently. Most modern believers know that religious texts aren't supposed to be taken literally but read with their proper deeper interpretation. But Harari seems to be reading these texts only at face value. All of us are aware of atrocities committed in the name of religion both in the past and present. But using that to attack the faith itself is bound to offend believers, whether they are religious or merely spiritual. Furthermore, when I read a scientific non-fiction, I would expect the author to keep away his personal prejudices while writing and present a factual opinion based on accurate research and/or justified hypotheses. However, just by reading this book, you can guess a lot about Harari's personal beliefs. That is a big NO! You can be whatever you want in your personal life, no problem. But using that to make negative claims about those who don't follow the same ideologies is not expected from such a respected and educated person. Additionally, facts that go with Harari's beliefs are presented convincingly. And facts that don't support his beliefs are conveniently ignored. It is said that half-information is dangerous. This book proves it.Homo Deus is all about Harari trying to be a Homo Deus himself, a human pseudo-god who is intent on making predictions about current and future human behaviour without realising that he has stumbled many times along the way. Sapiens seemed entirely factual, Homo Deus seems partly fictitious. Sapiens was perceptive, Homo Deus is pompous.Many readers might still enjoy Homo Deus. It definitely has some extremely astute observations. I just wish Harari had taken care with the rest of his assertions. Let me take an excerpt from the book itself to show you what I think of Homo Deus:
""Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with bits from movies we saw, novels we read, speeches we heard, and from our own daydreams, and weaves out of all that jumble a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate and what to do with myself. ... Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are all just stories.""
That's what Homo Deus is. A Yuval Noah Harari story. *Eye roll!*!121!Harari wrote Homo Deus following the success of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind a couple of years earlier. And while the first book’s ambition is to tell the saga of humanity’s past, this one is offered as a sort of sequel, showing what our future might hold. In truth, Sapiens was mostly glossing over the complexities of humankind’s history. And most of the first half of Homo Deus commits to rehashing the same arguments, only to thin them down with a slightly different set of examples and anecdotes. For example, Harari spends quite a few pages discussing once again the notion that human societies are shaped by arbitrary conventions or “intersubjective fictional entities” (economy, ethics, laws, ideologies, religions). He also devotes a significant part of the book to his pet cause: the callousness of industrial livestock farming. Most of the book is written in a journalistic style, with anecdotes aplenty, which makes for both engaging and easy reading, but at the same time, renders the book a bit sketchy, patchy, dated and peripheral.Nevertheless, Homo Deus starts to introduce new notions about halfway through. The core of the book is an examination of modernity, in the wake of what Nietzsche had coined the “Death of God”. The ideology that is currently replacing the moribund religions of the past is humanism, in its either liberal or socialist version. Harari briefly examines the question of consciousness and free-will, which are the founding (albeit debatable) principles of humanism. He also outlines the distinctive features of this modern ideology: the belief in perpetual technological and economic growth; the belief in individualism, “inner-awareness” and “self-determination” and, thus, in democracy and happiness. Even though, in the end, modern humanism does very little to provide meaning to human existence.Towards the end of the book, however, as Harari considers what might come next, it becomes clear that the blessings of humanism might ultimately be bestowed on a very limited elite. Harari examines how the humanist obsession with technological progress might well become the downfall of our humanist civilisation and the inception of a “dataist” dystopia. A few precursory elements include novel techniques of body and brain “hacking”, the systematic replacement of the human workforce by increasingly intelligent machines (and the social inequalities this will imply), and last but not least, the flourishing belief that the Self and even the whole of society is but a bunch of pre-determined data-processing systems. In other words, we are algorithms.Homo Deus’ closing chapters paint, with broad brush strokes, a grim picture of our possible future. The dawn of this new era is probably upon us already, and individuals are increasingly treated, through an ever encircling net of technology, as data-bags, suitable only for corporations’ meaningless profits — just as animals are treated as meat-bags, suited only to humans’ boundless consumption. Nietzsche (again) prophetically called this the age of the “Last Man”. That was more than a century ago, however, so there is nothing groundbreaking in Homo Deus today. In any event, this places Harari right next to a couple of other slightly gloomy transhumanists, such as Nick Bostrom.!121!I was a HUGE fan of Harari's previous smash hit Sapiens, and as such I came into this book with high expectations. Those expectations were met in some areas, and not in others: overall the book is engaging but a shadow of its predecessor.First, the good stuff. Harari's prose is as readable and clear as ever in Homo Deus, and he paces himself excellently. Too often in popular science books I find that either the author drags their feet getting to the interesting stuff or rockets over important sections, leaving some fatal misunderstandings. As in Sapiens Harari is economical with his words, saying just enough to convey the point exactly without overstaying his welcome. Additionally, similar to Sapiens the broad-brush overview of history is extremely compelling (provided you don't expect academically rigorous sources). Most of the book is actually a re-telling of the power structures that have shaped human societies, focusing on the concept of religions. Naturally this includes Abrahamic religions, animalist or spiritualist beliefs, and a slew of ancient religions. However crucially Harari also classifies humanism as a religion, and, in fact, as the defining religion of the modern period, placing the individual human at the centre of the moral universe. With this framework in place Harari then extrapolates modern interplay of religion and society forward a few centuries, speculating about what future religions might look like.This speculative section of the book is what drew me to Homo Deus, as I'm sure was the case for many readers. Unfortunately I think many will likewise come away disappointed. For such a long buildup, Harari spends very little time actually discussing the potential future, or how society might look with, for example, a caste of technologically-enhanced humans lording it over us mere biological peasants. The rise of machine learning gets the most thorough treatment, being as it is likely the most severe social disruptor of this century, but even the predictions here feel brief, even perfunctory. A much more thorough discussion takes place in Pedro Domingo's excellent The Master Algorithm. I really hoped for more from Harari in speculating how current broad trends might plan out, but (perhaps understandably) he shirks away from providing many predictions.This said, in the few years since the book has been published many of its predictions have come true. For example, the rise of not only ride-sharing but car-sharing apps is directly predicted. The very day that I read that section of the book I saw an advert for car-sharing app ZipCar on the tube. The rising discontent with politics (as hinted at during the writing of the book with the election campaigns of Brexit and Donald Trump) have absolutely come to pass. This certainly lends some validity to the broad vision Harari presents, and I have no doubt that his vision of how technology and society will interact in the 21st century will come to pass. Between the lack of details however, as well as an uncharacteristically patchy discussion of modern religions, and his perennial problem of writing for a popular audience and so skimping on references, this just doesn't hold up to comparison to Sapiens. Still, a recommended read for those who enjoyed the previous book.!121!Having read Sapiens, I had some idea that there would be new themes which Yuval Noah Harari would cover which nobody else has before. With Sapiens, it was about the agricultural revolution and the binding power of stories. And yes - there are brilliant new themes in Homo Deus as well - our delusion of free will and the Sapiens in a future world ruled by algorithms, and it continues excellently from where Sapiens left off. If Sapiens was about how the most powerful species consolidated it's power, Homo Deus is about what is in store for Sapiens. The theme of the power of stories - to bind and also delude is continued in Homo Deus. Stories - good or bad enables large scale co-operation among Sapiens - even if the story is not entirely logical or fair to other species. This has led to Humanism as a religion, where Sapiens have declared themselves as the centre and primary purpose of the universe. So everything else revolves around Sapiens - and all other life forms are for it's use. This has led to us being extremely cruel with other life forms and farm animals lead miserable lives from birth till death. The story which binds humans regards this as the norm and generation after generation sees nothing wrong in it. How would humans feels if a more advanced species (spawned off by artificial intelligence) should make judgements and kill undesirable humans?There are fairly long discussions around political systems and the growth of liberalism. I found this to be a little too long, and it could well have been crisper. Humans have acquired a combination of intellect and consciousness which was regarded as necessary for being advanced life forms at the top of the pyramid. Consciousness especially would be difficult to acquire. However, it is clear now that intelligence which is superior is adequate to ascend the pyramid. Already artificial intelligence is winning over humans in several fields regarded as earlier insurmountable such as chess and even the arts. Humans will depend more and more on algorithms and at some point algorithms will be all powerful. One big surprise which the book springs is around our free will. Do we really have free will? - or do we make forced choices based on experience and conditioning? I found this to be the most interesting discussion in the book.While I do not think the future will play out entirely as outlined, it might still be close. The reasoning and discussions are excellent, provoking us to think & reflect - and isn't that what is most important in a good book?Yuval Noah Hariri closes the book being thankful to the practice of Vipassana meditation as taught by S N Goenka for allowing him to look beyond conditioning and see things as they are. A sign that there is wisdom which is eternal and will endure, isn't it?!121!Видът Homo Sapiens такъв, какъвто го познаваме днес, ще изчезне след около век. Хора все така ще има (за съжаление или не – понякога не мога да реша), но ще са променени до неузнаваемост. Homo Sapiens-ите неособено елегантно приемат аплодисментите в последно действие и не осъзнават, че не им остава много до падането на завесата. Междувременно Homo Deus хвърлят одобрителен поглед в огледалото на бъдещето и се подготвят да излязат на сцената.Днес хората нерядко си задават въпроса накъде отива светът. Изглежда като че новините са пълни с катастрофи, природни бедствия, тероризъм, войни в конфликтни райони. Световни лидери предприемат действия, опасни не само за собствената им страна, пластмаса плува в океана (или океанът плува в пластмаса), вятърът на климатичните промени брули с пълна, но неоптимистична сила. Деконструкцията на основните опорни точки на човечеството изглежда неминуема. Носталгично поглеждаме през рамо към миналото, защото „едно време е било по-добре, по-спокойно, по-смислено“. Има една особена тенденция сред 30-ина годишните милениали (защото, знаете, 30-те са новите 20) на завръщане към някакви корени, които всъщност никога не сме познавали, пътуване, по-простичък начин на живот. Търсене на онова липсващо ни минало, в което не сме живели и не помним, но то е алтернативата на неудовлетворителното „сега“ и се вкопчваме с всички сили в нея.Момент. Ювал Харари често подчертава, че е много по-лесно да манипулираш нещо или някого, отколкото да го разбереш. „В миналото цензурата е функционирала, като е блокирала информационния поток. В XXI в. цензурата функционира, като удавя хората в несъществена информация… В древността да имаш власт, е означавало да имаш достъп до информация. Днес да имаш власт, означава да знаеш какво да пренебрегнеш“. Избраните моменти, с които ни заливат медиите, не са случайни. Хляб и зрелища му трябва на народа, са казвали в една друга епоха. Обикновеният човечец се чувства съпричастен, но и приятно погъделичкан, че лошото е подминало него самия. В същото време се поддържа едно леко ниво на истерия, че Второто пришествие приближава, а стресираните хора са хора, които правят грешки и се поддават на слабостите си. Хора, които удобно се възползват от всички привилегии на либерализма (в зависимост коя част на света обитават), защото „един път живеем“.Истината обаче е малко по-друга. Днес е най-спокойното време, в което сме живели (който вдигна вежда, да я спусне). Военни сблъсъци продължава да има, самият Харари живее в Близкия изток и твърди, че сигурно е по-вероятно светът да свърши, преди израелско-палестинският конфликт да намери разрешение. Въпреки това днес много по-малко хора умират от насилие, отколкото дори в недалечното минало. Всъщност повече хора се самоубиват, отколкото загиват при терористични атаки или войни. В миналото гладът, войните и болестите са били основните убийци на огромна част от населението. В началото на третото хилядолетие повече хора умират от преяждане, отколкото от глад, което си е своего рода значително постижен��е. Много болести са овладени. През Средновековието ако имаш гангренясал пръст, си направо пътник. Като се има предвид, че много лекари са практикували занаята си върху умрели кучета, не е за учудване. Днес медицината е постигнала огромен напредък, ако и все още да изостава в профилактиката и лечението на психическите разстройства, които все по-често си прибираме за домашни любимци.И все пак, „Бог е мъртъв“, капитализмът все повече пада на колене, чистият хуманизъм не може да се разбере със социалния и еволюционния чии преживявания са по-важни – тези на отделния индивид, на цялата нация или може би само на „развитите“ нации. Трактовката допълнително се усложнява от още два факта. Единият е, че понятието ни за същност, душа или единен Аз все повече се размива поради все по-нови научни открития. Хората са може би алгоритми, чиито действия са или детерминистични – обусловени от външни фактори, наследственост, лична история, или ��лучайни – биохимични процеси, които се случват в мозъка, защото… просто защото стават. Харари нарича хората не „индивиди“, т.е. неделими същества, а „дивиди“, защото сме съставени къде от мисъл тук, къде от емоция там, които отминават и други ги заместват. От друга страна нациите (както и религиите, и парите) са истории, измислени от хората, и съществуват само защото милиони хора вярват в тях. Ако не знаем в какво да вярваме… какъв е смисълът?Модерните сапиенси все повече избират да изповядват религията на датаизма. В нея не преживяванията на един или на много хора имат смисъл, смисълът е в събирането и споделянето на данни. Датаизмът е ревнива религия и изисква непрестанно преклонение, документиране на живота и свързаност с останалите. Това споделяне дава възможност на други алгоритми (може би като хората, но неорганични) да трупат информация за нас и да ни опознаят в смайваща дълбочина. Да ни казват кои сме, преди ние да го осъзнаем. Да ни помагат да взимаме решения и да не допускаме грешки. Да се греши било човешко. Кой би искал да греши, когато може да се остави в непогрешими ръце, така де, софтуер. Или? Последният пирон в ковчега на човешкото си остава смъртта. Смъртта вече се разглежда като поредица от технически грешки. Откриването на начини за постепенното им отстраняване може да направи хората ако не безсмъртни (ако скочиш от скала, все така ще умреш), то нещо много близко до „божествени“. Тази полубезсмъртност в съчетание с относителна безгрешност във взимането на решения спокойно може да изличи сегашните хора. Може би тогава ни чака бъдеще, което още не можем да си представим поради настоящите си ограничения. Може би дефиницията за „човек“ ще се преосмисли напълно, а може би ще изчезне и ще я замести нещо съвсем различно. Някога бих казала, че трябва да се борим да спасим човешкото. Сега обаче просто ще кажа, че трябва да се замисляме. Да търсим информация и да взимаме решения съзнателно (доколкото това изобщо е възможно). Да изберем какво да бъдем, защото в противен случай нещо друго ще избере вместо нас.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology']"
What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (Hardcover),Randall Munroe,4.14,174759,2014,"Randall Munroe left NASA in 2005 to start up his hugely popular site XKCD 'a web comic of romance, sarcasm, math and language' which offers a witty take on the world of science and geeks. It now has 600,000 to a million page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate. 'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive? How dangerous is it, really, to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm? If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power could we produce? What if everyone only had one soulmate?When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire?  How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?What would happen if the moon went away?In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion. Far more than a book for geeks, WHAT IF: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read.","This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. And I have read over 10 books.!121!I've been a reader of XKCD for ages. Not just a reader, a fan. A big goey, geeky fan. So much of a fan that when I heard about this book, I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book, so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner. And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did.!121!Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?!121!Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.
 
Who knew that physics could be so fun? 
Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes! Loved this one - it was so much fun!Audiobook CommentsI absolutely LOVED how you can just feel the enthusiasm coming from the reader. Even when he read out the math problems - you can tell that he was into it. Really made the book enjoyable!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!AMAZING BOOK! I love love love it and frankly, there's no better book to read on the toilet. Off the toilet too, but I learned so much and the writing is so engaging and entertaining and just MARVELOUS. Of course in the style of xkcd, this and Atlas Obscura would be my go-to book gifts this year.!121!My evil plan of reading this book in small doses aloud to my students during math class has worked. Several of them have bought their own copies, and they are, I believe, planning to use their math skills for good, and not for world domination.!121!“But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”Randall Munroe of xkcd.com fame (a former physicist and NASA robotics employee turned brilliant comics artist) can come to my house for tea and in-depth discussion of hypothetical scenarios based on the world’s dumbest questions (while showing me his back-of-the-napkin math which I will blindly believe as it will just whoosh over my head like a jet plane) any time. Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: ���So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism.!121!Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment.!121!This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind. The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads!!121!Change.Org Petition: Despicable MunroeThe International Astronomical Union recently named an asteroid after Randall Munroe; asteroid 4942 Munroe is big enough to cause a mass extinction if it ever hits Earth.Not that he needs an asteroid to do that.

XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?!121!An apple fell on Newton's head.""Why didn't this fall up instead of down?"" Asked the scientist......And lo, the theory of gravitation was born. - Well, not really. The story is apocryphal in all probability, like George Washington and the cherry tree. But it does illustrate an important fact.Scientific enquiry starts with seemingly absurd questions.-----------------------------------Randall Munroe is a physics graduate who briefly worked for NASA: but his claim to fame is as the creator of the web comic xkcd, where stick figures make fun of serious philosophical questions and scientific theories. According to Wikipedia, his site gets 70 million hits per month. And reading this book, it's not hard to see why.Munroe reminds us that above all, science is fun.-----------------------------------xkcd has got an inbox where people can submit questions of any kind - and they do. The questions have to be seen to be believed. Randall Munroe takes all the questions seriously - and tries to provide ""scientific"" answers to each. This book is a collection of such questions and answers. The answers are sometimes tongue-in-cheek, but there is the spirit of serious scientific investigation (experiment - observation - interpretation) in each: accompanied by his signature stick figures and one-liners, they are a delight to read.Some sample questions:""What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light?""""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space was created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water is being drained?""""Supposing you did Drain the Oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?""""When (if ever) did the Sun finally set on the British Empire?""""If an asteroid was very small but supermassive, could you really live on it like the Little Prince?""""If you suddenly began rising steadily at one foot per second, how exactly would you die? Would you freeze or suffocate first? Or something else?""These are just a sample. There are many, many more.-----------------------------------If you love science, or just like asking seemingly idiotic questions just for the heck of it, or both (like me!) - this book is for you. Or you can just hop over to Munroe's site and read these - and many more - there. You can even submit an absurd question yourself.This book is pure bliss.(""Wikipedia Protester"")!121!I highly recommend taking the audiobook route for this one unless you absolutely love very technical science. Wil Wheaton's narration was excellent and he delivered Munroe's humor perfectly! I loved this so much I bought a hard copy for my coffee table.!121!It was okay, after several ""stories"" it got boring. For me, it would be better just as a blog, to read ""story"" or two per week, not all at once. My favourite part was the Weird (and Worrying) Questions From the What If? Inbox.Sometimes I even felt like it had to be me who posted those questions - I believed no one had as crazy ideas/question as I do... It turns out I got a lot of soulmates out there. :D!121!What if … every Goodreads review had to be written in a randomly determined time? What per cent of submitted reviews would end with a completed sentence?Well, this amounts to the question of, what per cent of reviewers would simply stop typing when the time ran out, instead of finishing up what they were saying and ignoring the stupid rule.But there could be a correlation (or inverse correlation?) between how reviewers reacted to such a rule, and the day job they had – or the “purity” of the field they worked in. At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again! They keep coming back, really.00:20 I’ll quit while I’m not behind.''''''''""'''''''''''Previous review: It Can't Happen Here Sinclair Lewis or can lt?Next review: The Angle of Repose lit., not science or mathOlder review: Stoner John WilliamsPrevious library review: Science and Human Values Next library review: The Black Swan The Impact of the Highly Improbable!121!Every nerd knows Randall Munroe from his wildly humourous and insightful xkcd.com comics right? You don't? What the hell are you doing here listening to me blab on? xkcd.comFor all those people still here, and who obviously know Randall's work, let's just bask in the mixture of intelligence, cleverness, hilarity and properly labelled axes. All the nerd girls want to sleep with him and all nerd boys want to sleep with him too...be him.So it seems like he has been running a column on his website where people suggest extreme scientific hypotheticals and he tries to make sense of them and work out what would happen using his extreme knowledge of math and physics. I obviously have not been to observant because this book is the first I have heard of it. I guess I'm a bit of a shit fan. Hang on, I payed him for the book. Best fan ever.The book is a collection of questions he has answered as well as questions he did not answer for the good of society as a whole. Answered questions include ""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?"" and ""How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?"". These are the questions that I always ask while out in the world but I tend to forget as soon as I'm home. Or out of the shower. Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more.!121!This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!!121!The only thing that's thought-provoking about this book is the fact that it's sold millions of copies and is considered good by the vast majority.It bored me to death! Most (if not all) of the questions are simply useless. I mean why would I even give a fuck ""what would happen if you were to gather a mole of moles in one place"", or ""how many unique English tweets are possible and how long it would take for the population of the world to read them out loud"" (what the fuck???), or ""if you call a random phone number and say god bless you, what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed"", or ""what would happen if you tried to fly a normal Earth airplane in space""? This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"". Honestly I haven't seen so much useless information gathered together ever before. The extra star goes for the author's occasionally witty sense of humor.!121!Two years after reading this for the first time, I now own two copies and re-read it monthly. ******It started with a Kindle! Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram!121!I don't think I've ever laughed this much and hard from a science or non-fiction book-wait, I take that back, I haven't laughed this much from a book period. I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe.!121!This is a lot of fun from a guy who likes when things catch fire. A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.!121!This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there.!121!Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor.!121!Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul.!121!""It's happened to all of us. You're in the belly of a vast space station and you're trying to shoot someone with a bow and arrow."" -- One of many lines that literally made me lol while reading! 😂I love these types of books, there is something wonderful about pondering a good What If! This one is interesting, witty and will make you feel smarter than when you began it.!121!Please, PLEASE do not try this at home.That warning has probably never been more applicable, as attempting to reenact many of the scenarios from this book will result in our atmosphere turning into plasma and leading to the instant ignition of the Earth's surface. Yeah. Just what I need...one more thing to worry about.Seriously. Please do not try making an actual Periodic Wall of Elements. A lot of those elements don't play well with others. This book is massively entertaining and highly recommended.There are even a few proposed experiments that DO NOT result in the destruction of our planet. My favorite involves the speed of the International Space Station AND the 1988 song by the Proclaimers, ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqq4B...The interval between the start and the end of ""I'm Gonna Be"" is 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and the ISS is moving at 7.66 km/s.That means that if an astronaut on the ISS listens to ""I'm Gonna Be,"" in the time between the first beat of the song and the final lines . . .Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles to fall down at your door.. . .they will have traveled just about exactly 1000 miles.Isn't science AWESOME?!121!كتاب رائع يعرض عدد كبير من المعلومات العلمية بصورة مشوقة وجديدة من خلال أسئلة افتراضية ربما راودت اذهاننا من قبللو أرتفعنا في الفضاء بمقدار قدم واحد كل ثانية.. كيف سنموت من البرودة أم الاختناق؟""رغم ذلك هناك عدد كبير من الأسئلة التي تبدو سخيفة أو بلا معنىلو أجتمع كل البشر في مكن واحد قريبين من بعضهم بقدر الأمكان.. ما الذي سيحدث لو قفزوا دفعة واحدة؟!121!The explosion would be just the right size to maximize the amount of paperwork your lab would face. If the explosion were smaller, you could potentially cover it up. If it were larger, there would be no one left in the city to submit paperwork to.…A magnitude 15 earthquake would involve the release of almost [100 quintillion] joules of energy, which is roughly the gravitational binding energy of the Earth. To put it another way, the Death Star caused a magnitude 15 earthquake on Alderaan.What if? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions is exactly what it claims to be. Randall Munroe is a former NASA employee who runs a website, XKCD, where he posts web comics about science and the people who love science. He regularly gets questions from readers that he tries to answer, and this book is a compilation of his favorite questions and answers. The questions range from semi-serious to absurd, as these examples will show:What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?If you suddenly began rising steadily at 1 foot per second, how exactly would you die? Would you freeze or suffocate first? Or something else?How much physical space does the Internet take up?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?What if a rainstorm dropped all of its water in a single giant drop?The answers also range from semi-serious to absurd. There’s obviously been a lot of research and heavy math and science behind the answers, but he presents everything in a very understandable way, often with fun, irreverent comics along the way. And I learned, if nothing else, that you do not want to be in a rainstorm where all the water is dropped in a single giant drop. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. Recommended.!121!My boyfriend has never heard of XKCD. So I'm newly single, and looking for some fun.... ...book recommendations. I sure know how to live it up. OK, OK... Part of that is untrue - I didn't dump my boyfriend for not knowing what XKCD is. He's put up with some crazy kinds of shit from me, I GUESS I can accept this from him. *sigh* I couldn't resist reading part of this out loud to him, though. But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR. (Really, I couldn't imagine reading this in ebook format - the footnotes made me giggle so frequently that if they were a pain in the tushie to read on an ebook, so much greatness would be missed.)Finally, for best travelogue. I've always wanted to visit The Netherlands. ;)!121!Subtitled 'Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions' this was initially an interesting vehicle to widen a readers' scientific knowledge, which although at times quite funny, wears thin pretty quickly as it appears that the content is/was driven by how silly a question is, as opposed to what question would solicit the most interesting and informative answers, which would have been my choice. 5 out of 12.After reading, I added this book to my charity shop / thrift store pile.","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Physics', 'Comedy', 'Popular Science']"

Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.","Wow, this book took me on a roller-coaster ride. I couldn't decide if I loved it or hated it and it seemed like every few pages I'd go from thinking Gilbert was delightfully witty to thinking this was the most horribly self-absorbed person to ever set foot on the earth. In the end the overall effect was rather like sitting at a party listening to someone tell a long involved story all about themselves, and you're alternately annoyed and fascinated and you want to get up and leave but she's just so entertaining that you keep telling yourself you'll leave in the next minute--and so you end up sticking through the whole thing.<----- WARNING: LOOONG REVIEW AHEAD :) ------->I didn't hate Eat, Pray, Love, but it left me really unsatisfied. When I first started reading the book, I couldn't help rolling my eyes and thinking ""Here we go, another tale of a precious, privileged woman who is unsatisfied with her life."" I stuck with it though and was charmed through the Italy section by Gilbert's humor and down-to-earth writing style. Still, for a woman who abandons everything in search of a true spiritual experience, she leaves most of the important questions unanswered. I felt that Gilbert projects herself so strongly onto every place and every person she encounters that I'm not sure what she really learnt along the way.As delightful as the Italy section was to read, I felt like she never really stepped out of herself to understand the country on its own terms and to move beyond the stereotype. Despite it being a bit of a superficial assessment, I have no problem with Gilbert associating Italy with pleasure. There is enough beauty there to warrant it.It was more her interpretation of what it means to open oneself to pleasure that bothered me and seemed very narrow. For Gilbert this consisted mostly of overindulging in foods and allowing herself to put on weight. It seemed like she came to Italy thinking she already knew how to experience pleasure and proceeded to enact it based on her definition (even though there are indications that the Italian interpretation of pleasure is not merely restricted to this.) I would have liked to see her explore what it meant to devote herself to pleasure just as seriously and reverently as she seemed to take the meditative experiences in India. Overall though, my biggest problem with this book was I had difficulty at times believing Gilbert achieved the enlightenment she talks about because she is so internally focused. Most importantly I still have not really grasped why it was necessary for her to travel to these 3 places. I understand that her intention was not for this book to be a travelogue but it begs the question, ""Why was it necessary to go to Italy, India and Indonesia if the purpose was to not to gain something from them that could not be found elsewhere?"" In every country Gilbert created a little security blanket of expat friends who seemed to cushion her from really understanding the lessons the countries had to offer on their own terms. Why go to India to meet Richard the big Texan Guru, for example? Why not just go to Texas? For those of us with ""eyelids only half-caked with dirt"" but who can't uproot our lives and travel to countries of our choosing is ""enlightenment"" still an option? I wanted Gilbert to talk more about how anyone with an ordinary life but who is searching for insight could still balance spiritual yearning with duty. And that's my final peeve about this book. I wondered if Gilbert had any sense of duty or sense of obligation to anything beyond herself. Gilbert seems to recognize the bonds of duty that restrict the locals she encounters. Yet, she somehow paints them as pleasurable or inevitable yokes for the people who bear them. Her detached observations of life and death rituals in India and Indonesia as though they are restricted to those parts of the world made me want to shake her and say ""but there are rituals everywhere; you have made a conscious decision to remove yourself from the ones you know."" I ask about duty not because I wanted Gilbert to stay in a loveless marriage but because the concept of duty is also linked to a concept of justice. What is it that we ought to do? What do we owe each other? Part of me felt that Gilbert took comfort in the non-dual aspects of Eastern philisophies in a strange way. She seemed almost relieved that the non-duality of existence would ensure that one would not necessarily be punished by the universe for selfish deeds. I felt like Gilbert embraced that aspect of the philosophy without realizing the equal importance those cultures place on the balancing notions of reciprocity, duty, of being social beings in the truest sense (often taking it to the other negative extreme). The lack of sense of obligation to anyone other than herself made Gilbert seem curiously dead to the contradictions around her. She didn't seem perturbed at the abject poverty of the Indian women around her, or to question if it was just. She never wondered how a spiritual person should grapple with the injustice of the world, nor did she seem to question the ""rightness"" of living in the midst of poverty in an artificial environment created to specifically cater to pampered Westerners. In Indonesia, she finally seems to see beyond herself to the suffering of others but when she does try to help someone it seems impulsive and done almost with carelessness so that the whole thing almost becomes a big mess.After all of this, the end of the book just seemed to fall flat as Gilbert tried to wrap things up quickly, crowning it all of course with a romance with a doting and exotic lover. This book had a lot of potential but ultimately it seemed like a story about one woman's sense of entitlement and her inability to ever quite move beyond that though she does make some valiant efforts to do so.!121!WHY? I cringe to think why so many women want to feel that this was a true spiritual journey. It was a pre-paid journey. The woman starts off with telling us over and over about how painful her divorce was, however she dismisses how it ever came to be that way. Leaving her audience only to guess it was so horrible she had to leave and find herself.When asked in an interview if dumping her husband and pushing off wasn’t selfish, here is what Ms. Gilbert had to say: ""What is it about the American obsession with productivity and responsibility that makes it so difficult for us to allow ourselves a little time to solve the puzzle of our own lives, before it's too late?"" This statement alone tells so much. A responsibility towards a marriage and spouse is considered an unwanted ""obsession"" and one's own pursuit of happiness supercedes everything else? If a man decided to dump his wife and family to flee to the Himalayas to meditate we wouldn’t be calling it a spiritual journey...we would call it irresponsibility. India: This when she got just a little too proud of herself. I grew so tired of her boasting about how all her decisions led to a higher plan of consciousness and a new appreciation for life and a new understanding of the universe at large. And Bali was even worse. I was hoping the little old guy didn't remember her. Didn't that whole episode just turn out a little too cutely? And then she fell off her bike! She met her doctor friend, and bought her a house. And met an old guy, and then she did things to herself! And then she slept with the old guy. And of course she's better at that than any of us because she is now enlightened. And then she made a little rhyming couplet of a life in Australia, America, Bali, and Brazil. Double cringe.Italy: The author's angst and shallow self-discovery and pretend real people met with the express purpose of reflecting what she would like to 'learn' (lessons that most of us will have learned far earlier in life before more interesting lessons presented themselves.) To quote a phrase from the ""Italy"" section of this book, ""cross the street"" if you dare to even glance in a bookstore window and entertain a thought of buying this book. Elizabeth Gilbert has no ideas about life. Not only does she have nothing to teach, she has nothing to say. This book is so vicarious that it reveals a profound and deeply disturbing ignorance about the complexities of real life. The author's observations about life are simplistic and her insights so embarrassingly undeveloped and unsophisticated that she comes across as a detached observer. There are very few passages in this book that reveal any real sense of transformation in her life. She never really seems to glean anything authentic or deeply affecting from any of her experiences. And because she has gained nothing, she has nothing to offer. The reader is frustrated and unable to connect with her on any level. This memoir not only lacks readability, it lacks any real humanity. She is right when she says that she is not a traveler; she does not have the heart or spirit of a true traveler because she somehow remains deeply unaffected. She is merely a tourist, a spectator, barely scratching the surface of the lands she traverses, the people she encounters, and the experiences of what it means to be human. She fails to see the poverty that surrounds her, or maybe she sees it? She definitely never writes about it, maybe because it is not part of the road to any enlightenment.In spite of her year long journey she is still unable to gain true insight or wisdom from her pain and struggles. There is no profoundness in her journey, whether it is personal or physical. This book is just a simple walk through a simple mind. She is not even a good enough writer to be able to cleverly disguise her childlike observations in beautifully crafted language. I would rather read the trail journals of a young backpacker any day. At least they are 'real.' After reading the book, I wondered how it found its way to the bestseller list. I was perplexed by its popularity. So I did some research. As it turns out ""Eat, Pray, Love"" is an ideal industry example of how a publishing company can ""create"" a best seller from the printing of a trade paperback. In hard cover, this book only generated mediocre book sales in the year in was published. However, someone at Penguin adopted it as a ""darling"" and created a hard core campaign to sell the trade paperback.Well when they said “here’s $200, 000. dollars Elizabeth, now go travel and don’t forget to eat, pray, and love – when you come back I will get you the best editor and we will both feel enlightened.” So shallow, I cringe. I cringe even more for the women that buy into such shallowness.If you really want to live with intention, live your journey here and now. YOUR here and now.This book gets Zero stars.!121!Eat Pray Love is the monologue of a Neurotic American Princess (""Liz"") in her mid thirties. The first few chapters background the rest of the book, a confessional that tells how she came to find her 8 year marriage distasteful, realised she wasn't keen on the next 'logical' step which is apparently to fill her expansive apartment with children, and plunges into an impotent depression. Without even getting drunk.One night, whilst bawling on the bathroom floor, a habit she has grown fond of, she is struck by a flakey attack of twattery. Being an American, this experience manifests itself as finding some kind of God or thereabouts*. Naturally, she resolves to leave her husband. Her husband isn't keen on this development, and, Liz finds that, strangely, he takes poorly to having his heart shattered into a million pieces.Husband behaves badly, and our protagonist feels hurt and sad. But, no matter, because before long Liz hooks up with the sexy, exciting yoga chanting David, who takes a five minute break from his headlong charge toward floaty Thai fisherman's pants, a thin ponytail and male pattern baldness to rattle her well-bred bones. Liz drinks deeply from lust's stagnant well.But divorce negotiations do drag on, leaving Liz, once again, bawling on the bathroom floor. This time however, it's David's bathroom floor. And David, it seems, is unimpressed by such displays. It seems men are interested in women for their unique and interesting qualities, and unless you are Bob Dylan, melancholy gets old, fast. (Incidentally, if you find a chap who does like this constant emo-drama, then run).Here's what really bothers me about this book. Eat Pray Love is a New York Times bestseller. It was recommended to me by a friend, a woman, who is a successful publisher in her own right. According to her, this is the best book she has read this year. It's been a short year.In short, she isn't given to fawning excesses that one might expect from anyone who doesn't think this book should have been printed on softer paper (I think 3 ply would about do it). So I was surprised by her ringing endorsement.I am told, you see, that women 'get' this book. Which means they sympathise and understand it. I bet its on Oprah's Fucking Book List.With this in mind, here's what I will say when I am invited to Oprah's Fucking Book club:[feminist rant:]Women! You will get to the end of this book and may still be under the illusion that it is not your responsibility to make yourself happy. Whereas, it is, in fact, your own responsibility to make yourself happy. Being happy without being with a man does not trivialise love. You should find challenges, entertainment, fun, excitement, passion, the thrill of mastery and satisfaction of achievement through your own doings, not who you are doing. Love might enhance this. It cannot substitute this.Can you imagine if men felt so ""incomplete"" without women? When did is become acceptable for men to be our projects? When did it become acceptable for women to be defined by ""their"" men?, as if something less than this arrangement denigrates the sanctity of ""a relationship"". Fuck - until I read this book I thought I'd dealt feminism a crippling blow by jack-knifing the trailer this morning. I look like Susan Sontag in gumboots compared to this book.In EPL, the author's only explanation for her pathetic simpering twattery is that she is ""as affectionate as a cross between a Golden Retriever and a barnacle"". This is supposed to tell us why her sex life resembles pollen in a strong breeze.To her, and all other Oprah book clubbers who 'get' this book: get a Golden Retriever. Or barnacles. Or maybe a Golden Retriever with barnacles. But for sweet knit-one-purl-one-Christ, leave this book on the shelf.*Post Script; I'm not anti American, I lived there and many of the best people I know are Americans. I have, however, noticed a peculiar enthusiasm for Godliness in the land of the free.!121!Don't bother with this book. It took me nearly a year to finish it. I was so disgusted by the writer's apparent lack of awareness of her own privilege, her trite observations, and the unbelievably shallow way in which she represents a journey initiated by grief, that I initially couldn't bear to read beyond Italy. Like others who have written here, I made myself pick the book up again because so many people have raved about it, and I made myself finish it, hoping all the while there would be some redemptive insight or at least some small kernel of originality or wisdom. I was sorely disappointed. Liz is so obsessed with male attention throughout the book (in every section, she expounds in great detail on her flirtations with men, many of whom seem to ""take care of her"" or compliment her on her wit, beauty, or charm), that it makes her self-described quest to learn to be alone seem absurd and farcical. She does not have a feminist bone in her body; shocking for a woman who is purportedly on a quest for self-discovery after what she describes as a ""devastaing divorce."" She seems to have absolutely no capacity for self-awareness or reflection in this regard, and her superficial treatment of this and other aspects of her psyche bored me to tears. Basically, this memoir accounts her flirting her way across the globe into a new relationship, with little to no growth in self awareness that I can perceive. Even in India, her purported time of inward reflection, she attaches her herself to the likes of Richard from Texas, who seems a cross between a father figure and object of flirtation. Ultimately, she falls in love with a man much older than she, who seems to dote on her in quite a paternalistic way. When she spends pages talking about her bladder infection from too much sex, I have to question what her intentions are in writing about this? Why do we need to know about her bladder infection? What does it add to our understanding of her quest? To me, it says only, ""Look! I'm desirable!"" Not so interesting. Additionally, her brand of spirituality certainly does not come close to transcending the fashionable Western obsession with all things Eastern, particularly Buddhism and the ashram culture. That a Westerner could go to India on her spiritual quest and have absolutely no awareness of 1) her gross appropriation of another culture's religion, and 2) the abject poverty that surrounds her, is inexusable. She oozes privilege at every turn, and that privilege remains unacknowledged and unexamined. I was willing to look past my initial reaction that the end of a relationship is not, in the grand scheme of things, ""that bad;"" everyone's suffering certainly has its own validity. However, I was unable to muster much empathy for Elizabeth Gilbert despite my attempts to overcome my disgust at her shallow preoccupation. Ultimately, this woman had nothing to teach me (other than that I should trust my own instincts to abandon a book when I have such a strong reaction of dislike from page one). I am sorry I spent the time and energy trying to finish it. I happened to read somewhere that she has recently bought a church in Manhattan which she is converting into her personal living space. And this is enlightenment? I am sickened that Paramount has bought the rights to the book for a motion picture, and that she stands to make even more money than she already has on this insipid memoir.!121!This was one of those books I will read over and over again. All those cynics out there who criticize Gilbert for writing a ""too cutesy"" memoir that seems beyond belief and who claim that she is selfish for leaving her responsibility are clearly missing the point. First, she did not write the book to inspire you. She wrote it as her own memoir--you can agree or disagree with how she went about her ""enlightenment,"" but you cannot judge her for how she found happiness. It is her memoir, not yours. You can achieve enlightement by whatever means you want. Second, to call her irresponsible for leaving responsibilities behind is absurd. She was in an unhappy marriage. You cannot force yourself to be happy. I applaud her for doing something that many people are afraid to do. She had no children and so the responsibilities she neglected were minimal. I also suspect that those of you who didn't enjoy the book could not relate to it. You have never suffered a life-changing tragedy. You have never felt paralyzed by fear, anger, or disappointment. You have never had to go through a healing process that seems endless. You have never felt lost. That's great for you, but unfortunately that makes it hard for you to relate to this memoir. Finally, those of you who found her story too unbelievable have probably never felt the joy of traveling the world. There is no better way to discover yourself than getting out of your comfort zone and immersing yourself in someone else's. Traveling the world is not self-indulgent. If doing what we want to or enjoy doing is self-indulgent, then we are all guilty. If you are enjoying an ice-cream sundae, meeting your friends for a night out, or a good work out, you are being self indulgent. My guess is that those of you who didn't find the value in this book are unhappy with your own life. Perhaps you should be a little more self-indulgent yourself.!121!I am embarrassed to read this book in public. The title and the flowery, pasta-y cover screams, ""I'm a book that contains the relentless rants of a neurotic 34 year-old-woman.""So, I'm afraid that the strangers on the Metro will think I identify with her.But in the comfort of my own bed, I am totally falling for this memoir. Yes, Gilbert is emotionally self-indulgent (are we supposed to feel bad that she lost both houses in the divorce?), annoying (she's just tickled when she gains 23 pounds after eating her way through Italy) and often really immature (oh! The endless, endless crying).Then again, this is a memoir and when the writing is just so clever, so hospitable, so damn funny, it's really hard to hold that against Gilbert in the end.The plot goes something like this: A 30-year-old writer has everything she wants, including several successful books, a husband and two houses. When she realizes she doesn't want to have kids and that she's not happy after all, she has a breakdown and leaves her husband. In the process, she realizes she has no identity. Boo-hoo.But instead, Gilbert decides to pack up and visit Italy, India and Indonesia, three places she hopes will ultimately bring her the inner balance she's been longing for. (And on the surface, this book is a really entertaining travel essay. Gilbert has this wonderfully quirky way of describing everything: A piece of pizza, a gelato. And the people.) It's on her travels that I start to identify with Gilbert. When I was 21, I spent four months traveling in Australia. Just like Gilbert during her first weeks in Italy, I was totally elated by my freedom. But about two weeks in, the loneliness came around and so did the anxiety. My typical day started with this inner monologue: ""I have to get to the museum before noon, so I can fit in the sea kayaking trip at 2. And then I have to rush to the grocery store to get food to make dinner in the stinking hostel kitchen because god forbid I go out to eat causeIHAVETOMAKETHEMONEYLASTFORTHREEMOREMONTHS!!!!""Yikes. How I envied the Eurotrash who could just sit by the hostel pool and read all day. But if I didn't do everything, then I would have failed at traveling. In retrospect, Australia was a turning-point in my young life. I had no idea that this ""go-go-go"" attitude was how I had been living for years. No wonder people thought I was uptight. Relaxing had never come easy to me, and it never will, but I'm getting a lot better at letting go and not worrying about seeing every last museum... so-to-speak.Gilbert ruminates on this topic quite a bit in her book. Her first moment of true, unfettered happiness comes when she poaches some eggs and eats some asparagus on the floor of her apartment. So simple, but so fulfilling.In India, she writes that ""life, if you keep chasing it so hard, will drive you to death."" Gilbert is living in an Ashram, a place where people come to meditate and experience divinity. She's not very good at it, and she wonders if all the energy she's spent chasing the next experience has kept her from enjoying anything. At this point in the book, I find myself wondering if Gilbert wants to be there at all. Perhaps going to an Ashram was the thing she thought she should do, not what she wanted to do. I sure as hell wouldn't.What I really love about ""Eat, Pray, Love"" is that it's all about asking the simple question, ""what do I want,"" a question that would have come in handy in Australia and numerous other times in my life. It's so hard for some people, including me, and it really shouldn't be. I think that when you can honestly answer that question (""No. I don't want to go to that discussion on post-modernism, even though I realize that I should be interested in it and it would make me a lot cooler in your eyes. Really, I just want to watch back-to-back episodes of ""Scrubs"") you're well on your way to realizing your own identity and being ok with whoever that person is.!121!I found this book unbelievably phoney.I hated this so much that I got up early this morning to finish it and gave my copy to the library and honestly, I'm not too proud of that.To me it just felt so insincere that there's no chance I would have made it past the second chapter had it not been for book club obligations.I enjoyed her writing style, but I absolutely could not warm to her at all. To be fair, I do think she would be an excellent travel writer.The section on India was agony to read. I have met enough people freshly returned from Indian ashrams to know that they often seem a tad self absorbed and I also suspect that they really only get up at 3am so that they have even more ""me"" time. She didn't do much to alter my opinion.Honestly, this woman meditated longer, harder and bluer than anyone else has, past or present. She won the meditation competition that no-one was actually having. Possibly it was not enlightenment that she found, but simply that she finally became completely self absorbed. Easy mistake to make.!121!Shallow, self-indulgent and mired in the sort of liberal American obsession with ""oriental"" exoticism that is uniquely offensive because it is treated as enobling by its purveyors. She treats the rest of the world as though it exists for the consumption of jaded, rich, white Americans and this book is a monument to that sort of arrogance and ignorance.!121!امراة تترك كل شيء و ترحل ؛لماذا تحقق تلك الكتب و الافلام التي تتناول سفر""إمرأة""ما للمجهول كل هذه الشهرة و الشعبية؟مثل""النوم مع العدو / تحت شمس توسكان و بالطبع على رأسهم : السيرة الذاتية /كتاب الرحلات: طعام.صلاة..حب تنجح كتب رحيل النساء ببساطة : لان الأشجار لا تتحرك .نحن من نذهب اليها ..و المرأة =شجرة فطرها الله على ثبات جذورها في الارض مهما حدث لتستمر الحياة..قد تسافر وحدها قليلا جدا : أسابيع للعمل او للسياحة لكنها تعود سريعا جدا ..في الشرق و الغرب و الشمال و الجنوب ..ستصل المرأة دائما لوضع الشجرة مهما تأخرت..فهل رايت شجرة تنخلع و تجري الا في فيلم سيد الخواتم؟؟ و كل إمرأة في وقت ما تسأم الثبات و وضع الشجرة و تتمني و تحلم ان تفعل مثل اليزابيث / فرانسيس / سارة تبدا من جديد في اي مكان بعيد..لا لن تكون طموحة جدا و تبحث عن كل شيء مثل اليزابيث ..بل فقط .. تهرب من خيبات امل و قه�� و خذلان و علاقات ميتة و احلام مجهضة باحت اليزابيث بالمسكوت عنه..و فعلت ما حلمت به كل نساء الارض مهما انكرن : ينطلقن بحثاً عن السلام النفسي و الحرية  عندما تقرا على لسان امراة ثلاثينية انها ""لا تريد ان تكون متزوجة بعد اليوم!! و الادهي انها ترفض تماما ان تكون اما ..لانها تعلم ان الابناء ببساطة : "" لكمات في الوجه "" و هم جذور الشجرة ..اذن نحن هنا امام استثناء حقيقي لانها سيرة ذاتية حتى لو لم اتفق معها مطلقا في فرديتها و انانيتها لكني لن احكم على مسيرتها الشخصية و اختياراتها . . بل فقط على كتابها الصدق ثم الصدق و اخيرا قليل من التصنع هو ما يميز هذا الكتاب الثري المقسم ل3اجزاء  1. جزء :كله يدلع نفسه انا افضل جزء ايطاليا بالطبع مثل الاغلبية "" ....ايطاليا هي مهرب محطمي القلوب في العالم كله ..و عندما زرتها فهمت جوها هو الافضل على الاطلاق ..اهلها ""بايعين كل القضايا "" بشكل لن تتخيله ما لم تراهم .. يمارسون اعمالهم بانشراح غريب ..يتعاملون مع ابشع الموضوعات بتبسط مريب..لذا هم افضل المتعاملين مع السياح و الهاربين و الناقميين جزء : فوق بقى بالنسبة لي جاء جزء الهند في مجمله مملا جدا ..فالتامل يمارس و لا يتم الكتابة عنه. .و قد نصلي شهورا و اعوام لنصل اخيرا للصلاة التي نرضى عنها ..فنحن من نحتاج للتواصل مع الله تعالى و هذا قد يحدث في غرفتك الخاصة ؛على البحر؛ في المسجد ..اي مكان و ليس من الضروري ابدا ان يكون في الهندجزء 3 : انت معلمالطبيب الحكيم الكيوت"" كتوت"" يفعل المستحيل ليسقي اليزابيث حكمة اهل الشرق و يشرح لها ان هناك اربعة أسرار للسعادة و الامان هي الذكاء..الصداقة ..القوة ..و الشعر! !ا to be safe and happy in life: intelligence, friendship, strength, and poetryو لاني لا احب الشعر لن احصل على السعادة اذن 😢لا هنا و لا في بالي اليزابيث شاركت اهل البلاد الثلاثة التي زارتها افراحهم و اتراحهم..طعامهم و بعض اوجاعهم..كل ذلك و هي تبحث عن ايمانها ..عن سلامها المنشود ..عن القليل من كل شيء .. لذا جاء كتابها في ثلثه الأول؛ ككتاب الاحلام بالنسبة لكل المقيدات كتاب الرحلات النموذجي الذي نحلم به جميعا ولكن من الممكن ان نفعل ذلك جميعا في سفراتنا الداخلية و الخارجية : نتعامل ببساطة ؛ بابتسامة ؛ نسافر وحدنا احيانا لنترك فرصة للتقارب الانساني ..ليس من الضروري ان نمكث شهورا و أعوام ..و لا ان ننفق 200الف دولار و لا نحرق مراكبنا قبل السفر احيانا اليوم الواحد يقربك ممن لا تعرفه أكثر من بعض اهلك المهم ان تفتح قلبك!121!What I'm about to say must be wrong, because I couldn't get through this book. I tried. And I failed. So: I have NO BUSINESS WRITING THIS. Don't read it.A cousin recommended EPL and I thought it would teach me something about the book market. My secret boyfriend at the public library was horrified I checked it out, given his ACLU-offensive intimacy with my record and tastes; and yes, like others, I was embarrassed to have EPL in my possession.Because:What IS this MOVEMENT of lily-white bourgeois women with fancy educations working themselves into identity crises that they think can be solved by a new form of coloniasm? This hyper-feminized adventure travel? Subaltern poaching for the 21st century. Taker mentality as spiritual quest.These people need their own version of Outside magazine or some shit. Oh yeah, they already do. It's called the GAIAM catalog.Yeah. We're talking some serious dilettante tourism: taking entire countries as theme spas. Italy for excess, India for asceticism, Indonesia for the middle path. Ladies: Country I is not your personal terrain for self-discovery.

If your interior journey needs a bunch of leisure time and poor countries to be realized, maybe you're asking the wrong questions.The consumerist mentality was so self-important and so priveleged that I just couldn't make myself give this book any more time.!121!تمت14-septemper 2014و لم تأتني القدرة حتي يومنا هذا لأكتب عن هذا العمل شيئًا . -------------------------------حصلت عليها كهدية لعيد ميلادي الواحد و العشرين..طالعت الجملة المسطورة علي الغلاف: ""إليزابيث جيلبرت، امرأة تبحث عن كل شئ"" .و تخيلت وجهها الباسم و هي تخاطبني، هل تعرفين ريندا كيف يكون الحال عندما تكونين مثلي؟ أعني امرأة تبحث عن كل شئ؟نعم..نعم أعرف ! --------------------------------"" لا أريد أن أصير متزوجة بعد اليوم "" .اعرف تماما ما جال بذهنها حين نطقت بها عاليًا للمرة الأولي..أكاد أن أري النظرة التي بدت علي وجهها، تنظر للأرض قليلا لا بعينه، قليل من الغضب، قليل من التصميم، و الكثير الكثير من الخوف..و الألم.أكاد أراه هو، نظرة الغضب �� عدم التصديق..ربما قال ""ماذا قلتي لتوك؟"" بلهجة غاضبة قليلا..ربما نظر لها هازئا لعلمه أنها أضعف من أن تقوم بحمل نفسها علي تنفيذ قرار كذلك.أكاد أري محاولاته اليائسة حينما أدرك أنها لا تمزح..الصراخ و اللين..الشجار و التحدي، الدموع و الرجاء لتبقي..أكاد أري كل ذلك و أكثر. --------------------------------------- امرأة تبحث عن كل شئ، امرأة لا تريد أن تًنجِب.لكن كان يفترض بي أن أقوم بإنجاب طفل. عوضاً عن ذلك و مع اقتراب سنواتي العشرين من نهايتها راحت سنّ الثلاثين تضيق علي خناقي و كأنها حبل مشنقة..و اكتشفت أني لم أكن أريد الإنجاب. انتظرت طويلا كي أشعر بالرغبة بالإنجاب، لكنّ ذلك لم يحدث. أنا أعرف كيف يشعر المرء حين يرغب بشئ ما..صدقني أعرف تماماً ما هي الرغبة لكنها لم تكن موجودة..كنت أحاول أن أقنع نفسي بأنّ ما أشعر به طبيعي مع أن كل الأدلة تشير إلي العكس، كإحدي معارفي التي التقيت بها الأسبوع الماضي و التي اكتشفت للتو أنها حامل للمرة الأولي..كانت منتشية، أخبرتني أنها تريد أن تكون أماً إلي الأبد..رأيت الفرحة في عينيها و عرفتها. كانت تلك الفرحة التي شعّت من عينيّ الربيع الماضي حين عرفت أن المجلة التي أعمل فيها قررت إرسالي إلي مهمة في نيوزيلاندا للبحث عن الصبيدج العملاق.و فكرت حينها: ""إلي أن أشعر حيال الطفل بالنشوة نفسها التي ملأت كياني حيال الذهاب لنيوزيلاندا للبحث عن صبيدج عملاق، لا يمكنني الإنجاب"".لا أريد أن أكون متزوجة بعد الآن. ----------------------------احذر يا صديقي القارئ، قد تكون المرأة المُحطمة مملة إلي حد كبير..ستجدها متقبلة المزاج كثيرة البكاء و الشرود..قد تعيد قص الحكاية بحذافيرها العديد و العديد من المرات..هي لا تريد ردًا، لا تطلب منك شفاءفقط ابق و استمع ما استطعت..ستكون لك شاكرة و كذلك سأكون أنا. ------------------------------الوضع الحالي: لدينا امرأة محطمة، حالمة للغاية و ذلك سيزيد الطين بلة لو تعلمون. و لو لا تعلم..لا تتعجل، سنري معا! المكان: إيطاليا، الهند، إندونيسيا.الهدف:لا أعلم، هي أيضا لا تعلم و لكن لا بأس، أن تهيم علي وجهك لعلك تتعثر ببداية الطريق هو أمر جيد، لا تبق ثابتًا..تحرك ! ------------------------------------“أما أنا فأختقي في الشخص الذي أحبه...أنا غشاء نفيذ...إن أحببتك...تحصل على كل شئ.تحصل على وقتي وإخلاصي و ومالي وعائلتي....إن أحببتك أحمل عنك كل عذابك...أعطيك الحماية من مخاوفك...أعطيك الشمس والقمر وإن لم يكونا متوفرين”  ------------------------------------المميز عن هذا الكتاب و عن الكاتبة هو صدقهما التام، الكاتبة صادقة بسيطة جريئةمن قال أن الأشخاص الخطرين هم ذوي الصفات المذمومة؟عن نفسي لا أخشاهم..لا أخشي أحدًا بقدر الصادقين ببساطة مثلهامثلها يُربكنيمثلها يأخذ يدي برفق و يوقفني أمام مرآة تفوقني حجما و طولا..تجلس و تبتسم برفق و تخبرني أن أمعن النظر، و ألا اخجل مما أراه.""لا بأس ألا تكوني جيدة، لا بأس ألا تكوني بخير، لا بأس"" :) ---------------------------------------“يعتقد المرء بأن توأم الروح هو الشخص الأنسب له،وهذا ما يريده الجميع.ولكن توأم الروح الحقيقي ليس سوى مرآة،إنه الشخص الذي يريك كل ما يعيقك،الشخص الذي يلفت انتباهك إلى نفسك لكي تغيري حياتك،توأم الروح الحقيقي هو أهم شخص تلتقين به على الأرجح،لأنه يمزق جدرانك ويهزك بقوة لكي تستفيقي،ولكن ان تعيشي مع توأم روحك إلى الأبد؟كلا.هذا مؤلم جدا.فتوائم الروح يدخلون حياتك فقط ليكشفوا لك طبقة اخرى من ذاتك،ثم يرحلون.وشكرا لله على ذلك.غير أن مشكلتك انك لا تسمحين لتوأم روحك بالرحيل."" -سطرت تلك الفقرة في دفتري منذ عام مضي و كتبت: ماذا لو لم يرحل إليزابيث؟ماذا لو لم يسمح لي؟ ماذا لو لم أرد منه أنا أن يرحل؟ و كتبت أمس: تركته يرحل إليزابيث..رحلت أنا..تعلمت الحركة! :)  ----------------------------------------------يا من وصلت حتي هنا: لا أعلم إن كانت ستصيب روحك كما أصابتني..اقرأها و اعطها فرصة--كن صادقا، كن صادقا، كن صادقا .- لا تقاوم حزنك، دعه يتخللك..لا بأس ثق بي..دعه يتخللك، ثم أطلق سراحه ! :)-“عند نقطة معينة عليك أن تستسلم وتجلس ساكنا وتترك الرضى يأتي إليك” كن صادقًا، تقبل و انتظر-“ ان عجزت ان تكوني سيدة تفكيرك فأنت في ورطة كبيرة لن تخرجي منها أبدا ” -تمني لي أنا لو أمكن أن أكف عن البحث عن كل شئ، أو أن أجد كل شئ :) هذا و علي روحك السلام..كل السلام..شكرًا لك أن وصلت إلي هُنا. ريندا الوكيل13-5-2015!121!Ok, I admit I still have about 30 pages to go, which I will get around to reading soon (need a break from the book though) and which I highly doubt will prompt me to change my 2-star rating. I know many people love this book for what I consider personal reasons, therefore I tread lightly so as to not come off as critical of people's personal opinions, rather, just the book itself. First, I found the author not-so-likable. I've read other readers' reviews in which she was described as 'so funny' and like 'a girl we'd all love to know' and have to tell you, I didn't feel the love. She came off to me as lofty, self-absorbed, and needy. I felt like she wanted to make herself a victim of her divorce and her depression. She was so vague about some aspects of the decline of her relationship with her ex-husband as well as with some details about the divorce, which led me to believe that she really did a number on him, but then she whined throughout the book about how HE was the one making the divorce so difficult. I don't mean to sound judgmental of how she coped with it, because I can't relate to that and it would be unfair of me, but I just couldn't help but feel that she kind of bashed the ex a little when she was seemingly the majority of the reason for their split. Plus, she acted like she is the only person in the world to suffer through a divorce, yet she was ""totally in love"" with another man less than a month after she realized she wanted out of her marriage (and her account isn't clear as to how long after her realization she actually got the divorce-ball rolling so I can't help but assume she was unfaithul.) So it was hard to have sympathy for her when she got hysterical over the ex disagreeing about settlement details. Um, I would think that happens when you blindside your spouse with a divorce request. Not saying it's right, just saying that's life.Secondly, in her search of spirituality, I couldn't help but find some of it a little far-fetched. And could she have drawn out her stay at the Ashram in India any longer or with more mind-numbing, snooooze-inducing detail?? I found myself skipping entire paragraphs at a time, and not just because I was in a bit of a hurry to read the book before book club... but because she bored the hell out of me. My favorite part of India, ironically, was Richard From Texas. So I suppose that just sums up for us what I got out of the India section.But I won't leave us all on a totally negative note. I enjoyed parts of the book, some of them thoroughly. I loved her friends, for instance, and am perplexed at how I find the author so unlikable but somehow she has such cool people in her life? And she was SOMETIMES funny with little sarcastic bits that caught me off guard and made me laugh aloud. When she wasn't being overly wordy, I loved reading her descriptions of Italy, India, and most especially Indonesia. And, of course, who didn't drool over her description of that pizza in Naples? YUM. I read that part twice :-)~!121!Ok. I really didn't READ it all. I couldn't. I just couldn't get past how self centered and whiny this woman was. I just wanted to scream GET OVER YOURSELF! Then I quit reading it and now I feel much better.!121!Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth GilbertEat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia is a 2006 memoir by American author Elizabeth Gilbert. The memoir chronicles the author's trip around the world after her divorce and what she discovered during her travels. At 32 years old, Elizabeth Gilbert was educated, had a home, a husband, and a successful career as a writer. She was, however, unhappy in her marriage and initiated a divorce. She then embarked on a rebound relationship that did not work out, leaving her devastated and alone. After finalizing her difficult divorce, she spent the next year traveling the world. She spent four months in Italy, eating and enjoying life (""Eat""). She spent three months in India, finding her spirituality (""Pray""). She ended the year in Bali, Indonesia, looking for ""balance"" of the two and fell in love with a Brazilian businessman (""Love"").عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «غذا بخورید، دعا کنید، دوست بدارید»؛

در317ص، شابک9786009109791؛نقل از کتاب بخور، عبادت کن، عشق بورز: (مقدمه: نحوه صورت بندی این کتاب: مهره صدونه تسبیح؛ وقتی در هندوستان سفر میکنید افراد زیادی را -بخصوص در اماکن مقدّس و عبادتگاهها- میبینید، که دور گردن خود تسبیح انداخته اند؛ همینطور عکسهای قدیمی از مرتاضان لاغر و استخوانی و برهنه -یا حتّی چاق و مهربان- میبینید، که آنها نیز تسبیح به گردن دارند؛ در هند این دانه های تسبیح را «ژاپا مالا» میگویند؛ قرنهاست که هندوها و بوداییها در هند برای افزایش تمرکز خود هنگام مراقبه از آنها استفاده میکنند؛ به این نحو که تسبیح را در یک دست میگیرند و با تکرار هر «مانترا» مهره ای میاندازند؛ وقتی جنگجویان قرون وسطایی به شرق هجوم آوردند، با دیدن نیایش مرتاضان به وسیله «ژاپا مالا»، از آن روش استقبال کردند، و این ایده را با خود به اروپا بردند؛ «ژاپا مالای» سنّتی، یکصد و هشت دانه داشت؛ عدد یکصد و هشت در میان فلاسفه شرق، خوش یمن ترین و بهترین ترکیب سه عددی است که مجموع آن از ضرب عدد سه در سه به وجود میآید؛ و البته هر کس «ترینیتی مقدس» را خوانده باشد، میداند که عدد سه، عددی نمایانگر والاترین تعادل است؛ از آنجا که کل این کتاب، در مورد تلاش من در رسیدن به تعادل نگاشته شده است، تصمیم گرفتم آن را مانند «ژاپا مالا» صورت بندی کرده، و داستانهایم را به یکصد و هشت روایت تقسیم کنم؛ این یکصد و هشت روایت نیز، خود در سه بخش مربوط به «ایتالیا»، «هند»، و «اندونزی»، یعنی سه کشوری که در جستجوی خود به آنها سفر کرده ام، تقسیم شده است؛ بنابراین سی و شش روایت در هر بخش وجود دارد، که این عدد نیز برای من ناآشنا نیست، چرا که همه این کتاب را اکنون در سن سی و شش سالگی، به رشته تحریر درمیآورم؛ بنابراین کتابم را با توجه به ساختار منظم «ژاپا مالا»، به این صورت بخش بندی کرده ام؛ مکاشفه معنوی خالصانه، همیشه تلاشی در جهت نظم روشمند بوده و هست؛ جستجوی حقیقت چیزی نیست که همگان در مسیر آن قرار گیرند؛ در مقام جستجوگر و نویسنده، استفاده هرچه بیشتر، از دانه های تسبیح را، برای تمرکز بر کاری که انجام میدهم سودمند دیدم؛ با اینحال هر «ژاپا مالا» یک مهره مخصوص اضافی -مهره یکصد و نهم- دارد، که خارج از دایره یکصد و هشت مهره ی دیگر قرار دارد؛ ابتدا فکر میکردم مهره یکصد و نهم نقش یدکی، مانند دکمه ی اضافی روی پالتو یا جوانترین پسر در خانواده ی سلطنتی دارد؛ امّا ظاهراً هدف والاتری وجود دارد؛ وقتی انگشتتان حین دعا به این مهره میرسد، باید مراقبه خود را متوقّف کرده و از استادان خود تشکر کنید؛ بنابراین، اینجا در مهره یکصد و نهم، حتّی پیش از شروع توقف میکنم؛ از همه استادانم که در این یکسال راهنمای من بوده اند، سپاسگزارم؛اما میخواهم تشکّر ویژه ای از استاد اعظم خوش قلبم کنم، که سخاوتمندانه پذیرفت، همه مدّت اقامتم در هند را، در عبادتگاه سپری کنم؛ لازم میدانم این را نیز بگویم، که هر آنچه در مورد تجربیاتم در هند نوشته ام، دیدگاه شخصی من به عنوان یک نویسنده، و نه به عنوان پژوهشگر خداشناسی، یا مقامی رسمی است؛ به همین خاطر هم نام استاد اعظمم را، در هیچ کجای کتاب نیاورده ام، چون به نمایندگی از او صحبت نمیکنم؛ آموزه های آنها بهترین نماینده آنها هستند؛ من حرفی از نام، یا مکان عبادتگاه نیز نخواهم آورد، چرا که قصد تبلیغ ندارم، و آنها نیز نیازی به این مسئاله ندارند؛ همینطور نام تک تک اشخاصی را که در عبادتگاه ملاقات کرده ام، چه هندی و چه غربی، بنا به دلایل مختلف، تغییر داده ام؛ اگر اینکار را نمیکردم، بی احترامی بود و دیگران از ترس اینکه مبادا بعداً نامشان در کتابی چاپ شود، دیگر به عبادتگاهها پا نمیگذاشتند؛ تنها یک نفر از این قاعده بی نام و نشانی مستثناست؛ «ریچارد» واقعاً نامش «ریچارد» و اهل «تگزاس» است؛ تنها به این خاطر نام حقیقی او را تغییر نداده ام، که حضورش در هند، اهمیت بخصوصی برای من داشته است؛ کلام آخر اینکه، وقتی از «ریچارد» پرسیدم، که از نظر او اشکالی ندارد، در کتابم قید کنم که در گذشته معتاد و الکلی بوده، او گفت به هیچ وجه مشکلی وجود ندارد؛ او گفت «به هر حال من داشتم سعی میکردم سر در بیارم که چطور میشه اون موضوع رو بیان کرد.»؛ حالا میرویم به –ایتالیا...؛ کتاب اول: ایتالیا: «کلمه ها را طوری ادا کن که گویی آنها را میخوری»؛ سی و شش روایت درباره لذت جویی: 1: کاش جیوانی مرا میبوسید؛ دلایل بسیاری من را از ادامه این فکر بازداشت؛ اول اینکه جیوانی ده سال از من کوچکتر است، و مثل بیشتر پسرهای بیست و چند ساله ایتالیایی هنوز با مادرش زندگی میکند؛ همین مسئاله به تنهایی کافی است که او همسر مناسبی برای من به حساب نیاید؛ به علاوه من زن آمریکایی سی و پنج ساله با تجربه ای هستم، که به تازگی ازدواج ناموفقی را پشت سر گذاشته است، و بلافاصله پس از این جدایی طاقت فرسا و ویرانگر، رابطه عاشقانه آتشین ناموفقی را تجربه کرده است؛ این شکستهای پی در پی، من را شکننده و افسرده، و گویی هفت هزار سال پیر کرده است؛ نمیخواهم خودم را به «جیوانی» پاک و دوست داشتنی تحمیل کنم؛ ناگفته نماند، دیگر به سنّی رسیده ام که بتوانم بر عشق خود به مرد جوان و زیبایی با چشمهای قهوه ای غلبه کنم؛ به همین دلایل است که پس از گذشت ماهها، هنوز تنها هستم؛ علّت اینکه تصمیم گرفتم امسال مجرّد بمانم هم همین است؛ شاید بپرسید: «پس چرا به ایتالیا آمدی؟»؛ پاسخ من بخصوص وقتی پشت میز روبروی جیوانی زیبا نشسته ام این است: «سئوال خوبی بود.»؛ من و جیوانی از هم زبان یاد میگیریم؛ هفته ای چند بار اینجا در رم همدیگر را ملاقات، و با هم زبان تمرین میکنیم؛ اول ایتالیایی و بعد انگلیسی صحبت میکنیم، و هر دو برای یادگیری یکدیگر صبر و حوصله به خرج میدهیم؛ من آشناییم با جیوانی را مدیون کافی نت بزرگ پیتزا باربرنیی هستم، که آن طرف فوّاره ی مجسمه پری دریایی قرار دارد؛ چند هفته بیشتر از آمدنم به رم نگذشته بود، که آگهی کوچکی روی تابلو اعلانات کافی نت با این مضمون دیدم: «به یک انگلیسی زبان برای تمرین مکالمه با یک ایتالیایی زبان نیازمندیم.»؛ درست کنار این آگهی، آگهی مشابه دیگری که تنها وجه اختلافشان ایمیل آن دو بود مشاهده میشد؛ آدرس ایمیل یکی به نام جیوانی، و دیگری به نام داریو، ثبت شده بود؛ حتی شماره تلفن منزل هم یکی بود؛ هوش سرشارم را به کار انداختم و به هر دو نفر همزمان این ایمیل را فرستادم: «شاید شما دوتا برادرید؟»؛ جواب جیوانی، تلاطم عجیبی در من ایجاد کرد: «از آن هم بهتر. دو قلوییم.»؛ البته که دو جوان بیست و پنجساله قدبلند خوش سیما با آن چشمهای خمار قهوه ای درشت ایتالیایی، خیلی بهتر از یکی است؛ پس از ملاقات پسرها به این فکر افتادم، که شاید باید در مورد تصمیم مبنی بر تنها ماندن در این سفر تجدید نظر کنم؛ مثلاً، تجّرد کامل اختیار کنم، به استثنای همین دوقلوی خوش تیپ؛ به یاد یکی از دوستانم افتادم که گیاهخوار است، و به جز گوشت خوک، لب به هیچ گوشت دیگری نمیزند؛ غرق در رویای سوسوی سایه های شمع روی صورتهایمان در کافه ای در رم و نوازش دستان ـــــــــــ ؛ ناگهان به خودم آمدم؛ نه، نه، نه؛ چنین رابطه عاشقانه ای فقط زندگی دشوارم را پیچیده تر میکرد؛ الان زمان این بود که در پی آرامش و التیام باشم؛ آرامشی که جز در تنهایی و خلوت برایم میسّر نمیشد؛ اکنون، در اواسط نوامبر من و جیوانی خجالتی سختکوش دوستان صمیمی شده ایم؛ داریو، برادر پرشر و شورتر را هم به دوستِ دوست داشتنی سوئدی ام «سوفی» معرفی کردم؛ بگذریم که آنها چگونه با هم زبان تمرین میکنند؛ ولی من و جیوانی فقط صحبت میکنیم؛ در واقع غذا میخوریم و صحبت میکنیم؛ اکنون هفته ها از غذا خوردن و صحبت کردن ما میگذرد؛ از شریکی پیتزا خوردن و تصحیح صبورانه غلطهای گرامری یکدیگر. امشب هم استثنا نبود؛ غروبی دل انگیز با اصلاحات جدید و پنیر مازارلای تازه؛ اکنون نیمه شبی مه آلود است و من و جیوانی از مسیر پر پیچ و خم میان ساختمانهای قدیمی رم، که به رودی در حال عبور از میان درختهای سرو انبوه میماند، به سمت آپارتمان من میرویم؛ رسیدیم؛ رو در روی هم ایستاده ایم، و او به نشانه ی خداحافظی من را به گرمی در آغوش گرفت؛ این خود یک پیشرفت به حساب میآمد؛ طی چند هفته گذشته تنها با من دست میداد؛ فکر کنم اگر سه سال دیگر در ایتالیا میماندم، آرام آرام رویش باز میشد؛ از سوی دیگر، هنوز هم شانسی وجود داردشاید همین الان، زیر نور ماه،...؛ نه؛ گفت: «خدا نگهدار لیزای عزیز» و رفت؛ من هم گفتم «شب خوش عزیزم»، و تنها، به آپارتمانم که در طبقه چهارم قرار داشت رفتم؛ تک و تنها به اتاق مطالعه کوچکم رفتم و در را پشت سرم بستم؛ شب طولانی دیگری بدون هیچ یار و یاوری به جز تعدادی دیکشنری و کتاب ایتالیایی که پیش رو داشتم؛ تنها هستم، تنهای تنها، کاملاً تنها؛ با درک این واقعیت، زانو زده، پیشانی ام را روی زمین فشرده و سجده پرشور و شعف خود را نثار کائنات کردم؛ ابتدا به انگلیسی، سپس به ایتالیایی، و بعد هم به سانسکریت؛ فقط برای اطمینان از اینکه حقّ مطلب را ادا کرده امدو: در حال سجده ناگهان به یاد سه سال پیش، یعنی زمانی که کل این داستان شروع شد افتادم – لحظه ای که درست در همین وضعیت کف زمین زانو زده نیایش میکردم؛ البته درمورد سه سال پیش همه چیز فرق میکرد؛ آن زمان در رم نبودم بلکه در حمام طبقه دوم خانه بزرگی در حومه نیویورک بودم که به تازگی با همسرم خریده بودیم؛ ساعت سه صبح یکروز سرد ماه نوامبر بود؛ همسرم خوابیده بود و من برای چهل و هفتمین شب متوالی در حمام پنهان شده بودم و میگریستم. آنقدر سخت که جویی از اشک و آب بینی روی کاشیهای حمام جاری شده بود، جویی از شرمساری، ترس، پریشانی، و اندوه. دیگه نمیخوام به زندگی زناشویی ادامه بدم. سخت تلاش میکردم که باور نکنم ولی حقیقت داشت؛ دیگه نمیخوام به زندگی زناشویی ادامه بدم؛ نمیخوام تو این خونه بزرگ زندگی کنم. نمیخوام بچه دار شم؛ امّا قرار بود بچه بخواهم؛ سی و یک ساله بودم؛ من و همسرم پس از هشت سال نامزدی، و شش سال زندگی مشترک، کلّ زندگیمان را بر این فرض بنا نهاده بودیم که من پس از سی سالگی، خانه نشین و بچّه دار شومپیش بینی کرده بودیم که از سفر خسته خواهم شد و از زندگی در خانه ای بزرگ و شلوغ و پر از بچّه با باغچه ای در حیاط و قابلمه سوپ جوشان روی اجاق راضی و خوشحال خواهم بود؛ درک این واقعیت که هیچ یک از اینها را نمیخواستم وحشتناک بود؛ در عوض، سی سالگی برایم به طناب داری میماند که هرچه به آن نزدیکتر میشدم گردنم را بیشتر میفشرد، و من دریافتم که نمیخواهم باردار شوم؛ خیلی منتظر ماندم که شاید علاقه به بچّه دار شدن در من بوجود آید، ولی این اتفاق نیفتاد. باور کنید من میدانم وقتی انسان چیزی را از ته دل بخواهد باید چه حسّی داشته باشد؛ من چنین حسّی نداشتم؛ حرفهای خواهرم در حالیکه کودک اوّلش را شیر میداد هر لحظه در گوشم طنین میانداخت: «بچّه دار شدن مثل خالکوبی کردن رو صورته؛ قبل از انجامش باید مطمئن شی این همون چیزیه که میخوایش.»؛ اما اکنون دیگر چطور میتوانستم عقب نشینی کنم؟ همه چیز سر جایش بود؛ قرار بود امسال بچهّ دار شوم؛ در حقیقت چند ماهی بود که برای این هدف اقدام کرده بودیم؛ ولی هیچ اتّفاقی نیفتاده بود -صرف نظر از اینکه فشار عصبی و روانی باعث شده بود که هر روز صبحانه ام را بالا بیاورم-؛ هر ماه پس از عادت ماهیانه ام در حمّام به آرامی زمزمه میکردم: متشکّرم، متشکّرم، متشکّرم که یه ماه دیگه به من فرصت زندگی دادی...؛ سعی میکردم خودم را متقاعد کنم که این وضع طبیعی است؛ با خودم فکر میکردم همه ی زنها وقتی میخواهند باردار شوند همین حس را دارند؛ گرچه همه چیز خلاف این را نشان میداد؛ مثلاً اتفاقی یکی از دوستانم را دیدم که پس از دو سال انتظار و با کمک روشهای مختلف بارداری، سرانجام فهمیده بود که برای اولین بار باردار شده است؛ هیجان زده بود و میگفت که همیشه میخواسته مادر باشد؛ اعتراف میکرد که سالها پنهانی لباس کودک میخریده و زیر تخت مخفی میکرده تا همسرش متوجه نشود. شادی وصف ناپذیری در چهره اش مشهود بود؛ همین شادی را بهار سال گذشته تجربه کرده بودم. زمانی که فهمیدم مجله ای که در آن کار میکردم میخواهد برای نوشتن مقاله ای درباره ماهی مرکب غول پیکر من را به نیوزیلند بفرستد؛ با خودم فکر کردم «تا وقتیکه خوشحالیم از داشتن بچّه به اندازه رفتنم به نیوزیلند نشود، نمیتوانم بچه دار شوم.»؛ دیگه نمیخوام به زندگی زناشویی ادامه بدم؛ روزها سعی میکردم فکر نکنم ولی شبها این فکر مرا از پای درمیآورد. چه فاجعه ای؛ چطور میتوانم چنین موجودی باشم و این زندگی را خراب کنم؟ یک سال بیشتر نبود که این خانه را خریده بودیم؛ دیگر این خانه زیبا را نمیخواستم؟ دیگر دوستش نداشتم؟ پس چرا اکنون هر شب در جای جایش به سر درگمی میگریستم؟ آیا دیگر به نتیجه زحمتهایمان افتخار نمیکردم؟ به آن خانه باشکوه در هادسن ولی، آپارتمانمان در منهتن، به هشت خط تلفن، دوستان و گردشها و مهمانیها، به آخر هفته ها و خرید از مجتمعهای تجاری بزرگ.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 17/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 21/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!I just kept thinking wahhhhhh the whole time. Poor woman wants out of her marriage so she leaves.... wahhhh. Poor woman is depressed so she whines wahhhhh. Life is so unfair for the poor woman wahhhh.Please, poor woman is completely lost so what does she do? Why she takes a year off and travels to Italy, India & Indonesia to try and find herself. I wish I could say that this was fiction but it isn't. She's lost! Join the club but at least you have the money and the lack of responsibility to travel for an entire year and not have to worry about family, money and I don't know life in general. She finds herself by traveling to three parts of the world - Italy to find her body, India to find her spirit and Indonesia to find a balance between the two. OK, that part I get but I just had a real difficult time finding sympathy for a woman who is able to do all of that and still find time to whine about how hard life is for her. And guess what there's going to be a sequel - she remarrying so you know soon she will be divorcing and traveling to New Zealand, Prague and the South Pole to enlighten herself even more.Added to add - great now it's a movie. Soon they will make The Secret into a movie and we can all call it a day.!121!I don't think I've ever disliked an author more than Elizabeth Gilbert. Gilbert has the emotional maturity of an insecure teenage girl. In Eat Pray Love, she comes off as completely self centered. We all have been stressed at particular moments in our lives. But no one more so than Elizabeth Gilbert. She got to leave reality for a while. After she ate, and prayed, she met some amazing guy who she ""fell"" in love with, then, she got a book deal. But wait, it gets even better ~~ she got to meet Oprah! Her life was complete. But wait, it wasn't. Gilbert is ""suddenly"" gay and publicly comes out, proclaiming her love for her best friend who just happens to be dying from pancreatic cancer. This has all the makings of another best seller -- we can hear about Jose/Felipe being a bad guy and the emotional abuse he heaped on her and how she came to be an angel to Rayya Elias and stood by her side valiantly until the end, and the now unbreakable bond they have in life and death. No thanks Elizabeth. We've all grown tired of your need for attention. Do the publishing world a favor. See a good psychiatrist, grow up and stop playing the victim.!121!3.5 Stars! Review to come.!121!I waited, and waited, in ever such impatient patience, until the duct-taped box from my daughter arrived. It was one box among many, but this particular box, she had promised, would have within it her very best and most loved books, and among those -- Elizabeth Gilbert's ""Eat, Pray, Love"" that I had been longing to read. All of these boxes were arriving at my door because my daughter was taking wing on a journey like none before, and she is, for her 26 years, well traveled even when measured against adults thrice her age. It was a journey to complete her Master's degree, yes, but more than that. It was a journey to fulfill a young woman's (inherited from her mother) wanderlust, as well as a study abroad, as well as a spiritual journey, as well a journey of healing after a painful breakup of a relationship back home. Indeed, how like Gilbert's story! Almost as if the two women, never having met, have moved on parallel lines. Perhaps that is why Gilbert's story so appeals. If we haven't traveled it ourselves in our physical bodies, surely we have traveled it in our hearts and minds. Away from pain, towards enlightenment. Away from disappointments and varied betrayals, toward renewed, or even new, wholeness. Away from what was and full flung into what is and what will be. While our individual journeys in life may vary in detail, and no doubt rather unimportant detail, Gilbert touches so very many of her readers because in her honest, open, sincere, and often deliciously hilarious and hilariously delicious account, she speaks for many, many, many of us. Even if some of us stay in place to find our healing and learn our life lessons, minds and hearts travel freely. We can find our spiritual awakenings in an Indian Ashram, as she does, or we can find it standing in our own shower on a Monday morning, facing another work week in our accustomed routines. Gilbert's journey takes her first to Italy, where she heals her body, mostly through the pleasures of food; then to India, where for months she meditates and prays; finally to Bali, Indonesia, where she completes her healing and finds new love when she was sure she never again would. She takes us, her readers, along with a story that pulls us along jumping and skipping and running and gasping, not missing a moment, eating and praying and loving right along with her. I enjoyed the sections my daughter had highlighted; they might have been mine. My girl is heading to Europe, and her journey will not be so different, in pursuit of learning, and understanding, and healing her own broken heart. I have no doubt that she will return changed forever, and in a most wondrous way. Travel does that to us. The meeting with new cultures and peoples, challenging our own comfort zones, testing our own ideas of what life means and how we fit into it. I eagerly rush to read more of Gilbert's work. She knows how to translate experience into wonderful words, and for one reason above all -- her courage to write honestly about an honest effort to live life well. Most highly and enthusiastically recommended.!121!واو !أعظم الكُتب هي تلك التي تُغير حياتك ..هذا الكتاب , قادر على تغييرِ حياتي بلا أدنى شك ..كتاب عظيم ... عظيم جداً ..!121!Liz Gilbert is my hero. That is all.!121!Reading the title and the premise of this book will mislead you greatly as to what you are going to find inside.This book is not uplifting or spiritual in any way. Elizabeth Gilbert is going through life unaffected by anything except her own whims. She is so selfish and self congratulating, trying to disguise it as self depreciating and humble. Her writing style isn't so bad, it's the content. She continuously looks out at the world and how it is affecting her, not accepting responsibility for creating all of the unfortunate situations in her life that led up to her traveling to the three I's. Although she said nothing about her ex husband except that he was completely unreasonable and hated her (I wonder why), I still felt sympathetic for him. She gave no convincing reason for leaving him other than that she was sad.She spent her time in Italy eating and congratulating herself on not having sex with a good-looking Italian man.She spent her time in India ""meditating"" although it sounded more like complaining to me. (She does add a nice little bit about how she's glad she's not slaving away in the fields in the excruciating heat like some of the native women she sees.)She spent her time in Indonesia feeling superior to the natives who apparently want to take you for all they can. She also decides to end her sexual sabbatical when she meets a slightly older gentleman from Brazil who caters to her self absorption and vanity.In the end all she seems to have learned is that selfishness brings happiness, so if we can all leave our obligations behind and follow every whim and fancy, we fill finally find ""god"" or at least some form of euphoria. I think she's got it backward, there is something to be said for taking care of yourself first, but that is all she ever worries about. She is perfectly able to live her life however she sees fit, I am just irritated she put it in a book under a different guise and I fell for it.!121!Wow. I just gave Eat, Pray, Love a tearful send-off. And now I will relate to you the reasons why.The book has helped me come to terms with the fact that this whole divorce healing process is taking so long, longer than any of my friends expected I think, and that it's not over. But even so, it's OK. I can still live my life and do new things and make new friends and still work through it. I'm not cheating anyone by giving them what I've got right now, as opposed to the miracle woman that I think I should be. I don't have to stop living until I've deemed myself ""healed,"" because I am pretty sure this has changed me forever. Which is OK. It's good, actually.The author starts making a concerted effort to repair herself. She has a moment of self-forgiveness:I also knew somehow that this respite of peace would be temporary. I knew that I was not yet finished for good, that my anger, my sadness, and my shame would all creep back eventually, escaping my heart and occupying my head once more. I knew that I would have to keep dealing with these thoughts again and again until I slowly and determinedly changed my whole life. And that this would be difficult and exhausting to do. But my heart said to my mind in the dark silence of that beach: ""I love you, I will never leave you, I will always take care of you."" (p. 328)This has been somewhat of a mantra for me in recent months. I read in a sort of self-help book back in May a quote that has stayed with me: ""The only person who will never leave you is you."" By choice or no, everyone in your life is bound to leave you someday. You must take care of yourself, and be happy with who you are. Especially if you're going to spend every day of the rest of your life with YOU.Despite our best efforts to be happy, however, we're human and shit happens: She'd fallen in love with a Sardinian artist, who'd promised her another world of light and sun, but had left her, instead, with three children and no choice but to return to Venice and run the family restaurant. She is my age but looks even older than I do, and I can't imagine the kind of man who could do that to a woman so attractive. (""He was powerful,"" she says, ""and I died of love in his shadow.) (p. 101)""Died of love in his shadow"" is exactly it. I can't put it any better. I don't even think it needs explanation. There is pain and sorrow everywhere, within everyone. ""Life is what happens while you're making other plans."" Right? The author ends up in Bali, visiting daily with a medicine man. She asks him how to cure the craziness of the world:Ketut went on to explain that the Balinese believe we are each accompanied at birth by four invisible brothers, who come into the world with us and protect us throughout our lives. When the child is in the womb, her four siblings are even there with her--they are represented by the placenta, the amniotic fluid, the umbilical cord, and the yellow waxy substance that protects an unborn baby'sskin...The child is taught from the earliest consciousness that she has these four brothers with her in the world wherever she goes, and that they will always look after her. The brothers inhabit the four virtues a person needs in order to be safe and happy in life: intelligence, friendship, strength, and (I love this one) poetry. The brothers can be called upon in any critical situation for rescue and assistance. When you die, your four spirit brothers collect your soul and bring you to heaven. (p. 251) I love this spiritual Balinese metaphor for familial love and protection. I may only have 3 brothers, but I do feel like they are my Western counterpart to the Balinese brothers. My family has been with me all the way through this past 11 months.Another thing. I am reassured about my own attempts to travel, see people, grow, learn, live, love. Happiness is achieved with hard work. I've known this all along, and tried my very best to apply it to my marriage, but was dealt a blow and learned that I can only be responsible for my own happiness. I can't sacrifice myself for the happiness of someone else. I can't erase myself because someone else is having a temper tantrum at the airport. (I used to jokingly tell people that I pretended not to know him at the airport when he'd pitch a fit. But it was true.) And now I've been able to spend time making myself happy. At first I would elatedly think things to myself like, ""I'm in the car and no one is angry. It's quiet, no one is yelling or punching the steering wheel or threatening to turn around in 5 minutes if the traffic doesn't clear up. No one is weaving violently around cars and looking sideways at me as if to say, 'Don't challenge me, I AM a safe driver!' I can change the radio station. I can even turn the radio off. I can be ME.""Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it... And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it, you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it. (p.206)So how does one move on after trying so hard and failing to make someone else happy? The author of the book has gotten divorced and goes on a year-long voyage of self-discovery, and ends up returning to a place she had visited during the throes of divorce, but this time she is completely content. I read this part and immediately thought of Friday night, driving home from my friend's house. I drove past a Wawa where I had pulled over to cry my eyes out on my way home from her house one night in the spring. It was one of those moments in the car where I was alone and driving with my thoughts, and it was bad enough that I had to stop the car. I remember calling Andrea and crying it out with her. But on Friday I looked at the lot and thought, ""Poor Jen."" And I was sad for myself and what I had been through, but in a sort of ""she-went-through-a-lot-and-it-breaks-my-heart"" kind of way. Like I was thinking about someone else, a best friend, not living it in the moment. Now, although my experience was on a much smaller scale than Elizabeth Gilbert's, I SEE. I understand. I identify.I think about the woman I have become lately, about the life that I am now living, and about how much I always wanted to be this person and live this life, liberated from the farce of pretending to be anyone other than myself. I think of everything I endured before getting here and wonder if it was me--I mean, this happy and balanced me, who is now dozing on the deck of this small Indonesian fishing boat--who pulled the other, younger, more confused and more struggling me forward during all those hard years... Knowing already that everything would be OK, that everyhing would eventually bring us together here. Right here, right to this moment. Where I was always waiting in peace and contentment, always waiting for her to arrive and join me. (pp. 329-330)And that's not all: In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. (p. 334)!121!I have been hating this book for such a long time without reading it. Without any judgment, I loved what this book has to teach with such simplicity and sweetness!And made me laugh at a few times too!!121!""Oh, you spent a year in India? Well, have you read that book Eat, Pray, Love? She was in India, too! You'd love it!""If I can forgive Elizabeth Gilbert for being paid upfront to undertake a journey of ""self-discovery"" (and I can--sign me up for ""Clueless in Calcutta""!), then certainly, she can forgive me for only reading this because I felt obligated to do so. (And for ""riding her coattails"" in this review, so to speak.)Her style is pretty easy to get into, although I was completely fed up with her sense of humor by I got to the end of the Italy ""eat"" section. There are certainly things we can admire her for: her honesty, for starters, even if she gets really annoying.A style note: I really love that she divided up the book into three main sections, with 36 stories each, for a total of 108 stories. I felt that some of the 36 sections were rather arbitrarily forced into sections, but I still love the set-up.I can't speak for her trips in Italy and Bali, knowing nothing about the culture, but I can speak for India, and it needs it.To sum up the ""Pray"" chapter in one line: Her experience in India was akin to someone coming to America and staying at Disneyland for four months.This is not to belittle her spiritual development there; in fact, I think the India section was my favorite out of the three. I've had friends say that they didn't want to go to India after reading this section, or that it was ""long"" and ""boring"", but I really enjoyed getting inside her head and watching her smooth out some very big knots and minor kinks.When it comes down to it, however, she stayed at an Ashram for the entire duration of her stay in India, only really leaving the compound to drink soda (which, fyi, is called ""Thums-Up"" not ""Thumbs-Up"", and presumably does not have high fructose corn syrup in it, as most Indian sodas use sugar instead).I've been to a few of these compounds, namely, the Root Institute in Bodh Gaya and the Deer Park Institute in Bir. They are modern, clean, and often amazing institutes (Deer Park has a ""plastic room"": they recycle everything, and for those juice boxes and plastic bags they can't? They put them in a room, until the day arrives that they can properly dispose of the material without damage to the environment). For an American tourist, these are great places to go on retreat, because you are largely sheltered from the Indian life outside. You get filtered water, nice and nutritious meals (with low risk of dysentery!), access to hot water (through solar panels, but many places also have heaters that they can switch on for you if it's a cloudy day), Western toilets (over-rated), and you meet some amazing people in these places--usually a mixture of extremely-well-to-do Indians and educated people from around the world. You will, occasionally, meet one or two locals, usually employed by the institutes.But what you experience in these institutes is NOT the culture that lies outside. It's equivalent to Disneyland because you are taken care of, and can pick and choose what you want to do (literally: yoga or meditation? field trip to the fabulous Hindu temple a day's car ride away?), and as American as Disneyland may be, it's only one small facet of what America is and stands for.She mentions, while having a particularly moving spiritual experience, that ""this is the worst nightmare of every American parent whose child has ever run away to India to find herself--that she will end up having orgies with trees in the moonlight."" I laughed, and asked my mom if she thought that's what I was doing. She didn't say anything, so I said, ""You were probably worried I was having real orgies!""She fails to understand a few key points about India: one, that a female monk, in as many traditions as I am aware, is translated to ""nun"" in the English language; and two, that the reason why flights out of India are often at 4 am is to expediate your transition into another timezone. For instance, if you're traveling from Delhi to Bangkok, your plane will leave late at night so when you arrive in Bangkok, it is morning, and you have to force yourself to stay awake, thus helping you defeat your jetlag. Same with flights from Delhi to New York; I might have been as tired as all hell, but hello New York sunlight!So, would I recommend this book? Probably not, unless you're interested in what a privileged white woman can do with a book advance, or if you're interested in Indian new-age beliefs. This is a bathtub-full-of-bubbles read: completely mindless, but ohhhh pretty bubbles. You might get something out of it, but it is by no means a religious text, or one that's life-changing.The next person that comes up to me, finds out I spent a year in India, and brings up this book is only going to get a sweet smile and, ""Did you enjoy that book? Wait until mine comes out.""!121!Elizabeth Gilbert is a really good writer but I still had to absolutely slog through to the end of her annoying book. I did so with the faint hope that maybe there would be some last minute clue about all the hype —or that maybe Gilbert would finally wake up one morning and say “Hey, maybe it’s not all about me!” No such luck. Her perspective is shallow, completely self-absorbed and lacking in empathy. The spiritual part of her quest never translates to any feelings of compassion or altruism. Gilbert spends close to a year living among the poorest people in the world and still manages to think about nothing but herself and her own needs. Ugh—this book is offensive.!121!أداء رائع جبار وسيرة ذاتية ضمن سياق روائي مذهل..المشكلة في تقييمي لأمر ما هو دائما ما يكون تحت الضغط الذي تسوقه العواطف لكن ما وجدته في هذا الكتاب يسمو أيضا عن جبر خاطر العاطفة .....إن رحلة البحث عن الذات وايثار حياة الاستقرار لإعادة استكشاف الروح هو محتوي هذه القطعة الابداعية أما الماهية فكانت من خلال العنوان ( طعام،صلاة،حب).فالطعام مقرون باللذة والروحانية هي سمو النفس من خلال الصلاة والحب مصدره العاطفة لذا كان السفر الي ايطاليا فالهند عقبتها رحله اندونيسيا ...........أذهلني الكتاب وراقلي ما قرأت وأنا الان أقرأه من جديد بنسخته الانجليزية...حقا يستحق الاشادة!121!I checked the dictionary definition of “self-absorbed” and, sure enough, there’s a picture of this book. This is of those few books that I bitterly resent having spent my money on.!121!I had a very love/give-me-a-break relationship with this book, so I had to give it a week or so before writing a review to let it settle. I began the book on an optimistic note, then quickly became annoyed with the long, rambling chapters justifying the author's use of the word ""God"" and how OTHER words for ""God"" are neither better nor worse, more nor less accurate, than ""God"" but this author feels a connection with the word ""God"" so she's going to use it here but REALLY, there are LOTS of ways to express the concept, etc. etc. etc. I breathed a sigh of relief when the Italy section began, and my annoyance quickly turned into enjoyment; in fact, during this section, I couldn't put the book down. I found the author's honesty endearing and her handling of telling the story of her divorce to be very tasteful (she declines to go into much detail or to take cheap swipes at her ex-husband--a choice that becomes even more obviously conscious as the book goes on and the reader realizes that bold honesty is not something this author shies away from). The India section, though it had its bright moments and colorful personalities (Richard from Texas was one of my favorite people in the book), was sluggish, especially during long examinations of the author's difficulty with meditating, her relationship with God, and other highly personal experiences that, frankly, I applaud her for living so fully and experiencing so honestly, but don't feel they are really relevant or all that interesting to anyone else. They're the stuff of personal journals, not dinner-table conversation. The best example of this was a chapter in which the author abruptly reveals that she traveled through her meditative vortex and encountered God. There's no setting the stage or putting the experience into the context of the rest of the book, just several long pages describing the ways she couldn't possibly describe it. Sections like this, to me, only alienate the reader.The last section, set in Bali, did much to humanize her after those esoteric meditations on...meditation. I loved that the reader could really feel that she was finally transcending this deeply inward, wounded stage of her life and coming out onto the other side. Her writing shed much of its cumbersome devotion to detail, and we began to hear from her not every day or every moment, but periodically, to give us an update on where she'd been and what she'd been doing. It felt to me that she was finally living her life instead of just writing about it.After a few days of processing the book, what stood out for me was the author's truly courageous willingness to write in an intensely personal style and be completely honest about herself. There were points when her honesty made me feel a bit uncomfortable--the type of uncomfortable where you wonder, ""Did she mean to tell us that??"" But in the end, I admired that the book was so unapologetically truthful--really a deeply felt, no-holds-barred account of one person's struggle to live through the joys and devastations that we all experience. It's not often that an author lets her readers in so completely, and though it didn't always connect for me, I appreciated that.!121!"" امرأة تبحث عن كُل شيء ""تلك العبارة على غلاف الرواية , هي ما جذبني للكتاب كالمغناطيس( إنها أنا )هكذا حدثت نفسي إنها أنا ..تلك من تبحث عن كُل الشيءتلك التي تُريد أن تُصبح حرة , دون قيود , تقضي حياتها ما بين السفر والتجول في كُل ركن في العالم , تبحث عن تاريخ هذا الركن , تشارك أهله حياتهم وأيامهم , تتذوق طعامهم , تحبهم ويحبونهاكُل ما تريده هو تعلم لغة , كتاب جديد تقرؤه , وجبة لذيذة أو حتى كوب نسكافيهتُغريها السعادة التي تكمن في الأشياء البسيطةلكن سرعان ما يؤرقها حنينها وتوقها للحياة المستقرة للأمومـة ( - أنتِ ترغبين في الكثير , والحياة لن تمنحك كُل شيء عزيزتي - أنا لا أرغب في الكثير , أنا فقط أرغب في القليل من كُل شيء- طمع أم أنانية- بل طموح- لكن حظك ....- أعلم , أعلم أنك ستقولين أني سيئة الحظ - بل لا تملكين حظاً من الأساس - فليكن , أنا لا أؤمن بالحظ- بماذا تؤمنين إذا - أؤمن بأشياء أخرى كالقدر و ... النصيب )تذكرت حواري مع نفسي هذا , عندما كانت إليزابيث تتحدث إلى نفسها من خلال دفترهاوعندما كانت تجثو على ركبتيها ورأسها على أرض الحمام , تبكي وتئن بصمتذكرتني كيف كُنت أظل طوال نصف ساعة ساجدة وأبكي بقلب يملؤه الألم , لأنهض براحة وكأني تركت كُل همومي على الأرض ورحلت ذكرتني بتفاصيل كثيرة في حياتي , منها ما نسيته ومنها ما لم أرغب في تذكرهأعتقد هذا هو سر تعلقي بهذه الرواية تشبهني :)أحببت ليز , أحببت جرأتها في كتابة مشاعرها وآلامها إنه من الصعوبة أن تشارك من هم أقرب الأشخاص إليك في لحظات ضعفككيف وأنت تشارك ضعفك وتقصه على ملايين القراء !!أحببت طريقة السرد العفوية شعرت بصدق آلمها , وسعدت بسعادتها التي توصلت إليها في النهايةطعام في إيطاليا > تعلمت أنه هناك أشياء كثيرة في منتهى البساطة , من شأنها أن تخلق لنا السعادةصلاة في الهند > تعلمت أهمية الروحانية في الذاتأهمية وجود ( الله ) في حياتيحقاً نحُن من نحتاجه , نحتاج أن نثق في أعماقنا أنه هناك من يرعانا ويشملنا بحمايتهأحتاجه لأجد التوازن داخلي , وسلامي النفسيحب في أندونيسيا > ذكرتني بجملة أحلام مستغانمي أجمل حبّ هو الذي نعثُر عليه أثناء بحثِنا عن شيء آخر أتمنى أن أجـد سلامي النفسي وتوازني الداخلي يوماً ما :)أعتقد أنني بعد قراءة الرواية سأبحث أكثر عن التأمل واليوغا وفوائدهما وربما مارستهما أعجبتني الفكرة :D!121!this was beautiful and long journey between Italy , India , Indonesia i learned a lot of things in this book was amazing and a little boring for me i loved Italy part more than India and Indonesia but it's good book over all and happy to read it 💕'","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Romance', 'Chick Lit', 'Spirituality']"

There’s no better guide through these mind-expanding questions than acclaimed astrophysicist and best-selling author Neil deGrasse Tyson.But today, few of us have time to contemplate the cosmos. So Tyson brings the universe down to Earth succinctly and clearly, with sparkling wit, in tasty chapters consumable anytime and anywhere in your busy day.","Imagine you are standing with your face up and your mouth wide open underneath a waterfall of Skittles. At first, a few Skittles get into your mouth and you can taste them. Awesome, you think. I love Skittles.Then, the Skittles become overwhelming, as more and more try to force themselves in, and millions and millions puddle around your feet, piling up past your knees.That's kind of how this was.I'm all about learning new things, but there were SO MANY FACTS IN SUCH A SMALL SPAN. By the time I hit page twenty, I realized I was mentally absent as my eyes and mind processed words but failed to commit those words to actual thought. I wanted to love this book. I want you to love this book. Alas, I just felt overwhelmed.I recommend this book, but read it slowly and in small sittings. As a person in a hurry, I tried to plow through it all at once and became lost.received via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.decafjess.blogspot.com!121!Ah, yes. Nothing like an astrophysics book for beginners to remind me why I’m not an astrophysicist! Even at the basic level, with Tyson’s clear, funny and accessible writing, I found a lot of these concepts WAY over my head. Nevertheless, it is fascinating stuff. My big takeaway was humility: just how small humans are in the grand scheme of things, and there is something freeing about that. It reminded me of a fake headline on The Onion news satire site that made me chuckle: Obama Reassures Americans: ‘The future, and I’m talking three billion years from now, is still bright.”The amount we don’t know about the universe is staggering. Dark matter, dark energy . . . how can we be completely unaware of forces that make up the bulk of our universe? But also, how amazing is it that we can find this stuff out from our little speck of a planet in the suburbs of Nowheresville, Milky Way Galaxy?

Neil deGrasse Tyson, within 224 pages, attempts to cover the entirety space and time. He does a pretty good job.  However,  this is not  Astrophysics for Dummies. There are assumptions made for the audience - you do need a bit of a working knowledge on particles and space to fully understand the significance of the text. That being said, I could still (mostly) follow along even in the areas where I knew little to nothing about.This is somewhat similar to Bill Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything but with less emphasis on human accomplishments. Like Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson provides great analogies when he explains the creation (and subsequent formation) of the universe. If we combine both books, it feels like we get a Short History of Everything.However...he does waste page space needling his audience about religion, which I could've definitely done without in such a compact book. (It felt rather distasteful).I really liked how Tyson could break down complex topics.
Matter tells space how to curve; space tells matter how to move.
And how he was able to inject humor in such dry matter.
The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.
I would like a sequel called

Audiobook CommentsRead by the author - and was a joy to listen to!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!If you are a person who is interested to know more about Astrophysics but doesn’t know anything about it, Neil DeGrasse Tyson is there to help you with this book. The author took extra care to ensure that his book won’t have the common mistake seen in the books written by people who had education from Ivy League Universities (Mr. Tyson went to Harvard and Columbia to get his degree and Ph.D.). Instead of bombarding us with a lot of scientific jargon, the author decided to write in a simple language that everyone can read. The felicity in his love for astrophysics is estimable.
What I learned from this book 

1) What is the biggest sign of lack of intelligence in human beings? 
The author sarcastically criticizes the ignorance of human beings about pollution. He says that it is the biggest sign of lack of intelligence in human beings. “Looking more closely at Earth’s atmospheric fingerprints, human biomarkers will also include sulfuric, carbonic, and nitric acids, and other components of smog from the burning of fossil fuels. If the curious aliens happen to be socially, culturally, and technologically more advanced than we are, then they will surely interpret these biomarkers as convincing evidence for the absence of intelligent life on Earth.”  
2) Why is astronomy considered as the most sublime form of science? 
Astronomy is the empirical branch of science that plays a vital role in our life. The author tells us the reason why astronomy is very important. “Of all the sciences cultivated by mankind, Astronomy is acknowledged to be, and undoubtedly is, the most sublime, the most interesting, and the most useful. For, by knowledge derived from this science, not only the bulk of the Earth is discovered . . . ; but our very faculties are enlarged with the grandeur of the ideas it conveys, our minds exalted above [their] low contracted prejudices.”  
3) Whipped cream and the universality of the physical law.
The author narrates a funny experience he had in a restaurant in California. “A few years ago I was having a hot-cocoa nightcap at a dessert shop in Pasadena, California. Ordered it with whipped cream, of course. When it arrived at the table, I saw no trace of the stuff. After I told the waiter that my cocoa had no whipped cream, he asserted I couldn’t see it because it sank to the bottom. But whipped cream has low density, and floats on all liquids that humans consume. So I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant. Unconvinced, he defiantly brought over a dollop of whipped cream to demonstrate his claim. After bobbing once or twice the whipped cream rose to the top, safely afloat. What better proof do you need of the universality of physical law?”  
My favourite three lines from this book 
 “The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”  “We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”    “I don't know about you, but the planet Saturn pops into my mind with every bite of a hamburger I take.”   
What could have been better?
If you are not an astrophysicist, you will inevitably find out that the name of this book is a misnomer. You cannot read this book in a hurry, even if it is written in a simple language. It is because a lot of information is packed in the 208 pages. 
Rating 
 4/5 This book will be a perfect choice if you want to know more about astrophysics through epigrams, aphorisms, funny experiences, and scientific principles written in a simple and palatable manner by the erudite.!121!I think it's pretty self explanatory what this book is about so no need to summarize. I have to say though that I'm generally not a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, because a lot of times he'll just indulge the actual stupid things other people say. Like the whole ""debate"" about whether or not we're living in a simulation after Elon Musk made that comment. Every time this happens I can't find any actually science news in my newsfeeds because now suddenly everyone is only talking about that one dumb thing. I guess that's not really Neil's fault but I never claimed to be rational. Regardless of my general feelings of irritation whenever I see Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about pop science things I think this books was pretty awesome. It's definitely a short read that manages to be accessible and comprehensive. The only thing I didn't like was the closing chapter, mostly because I'm belligerent and bitter and when people try to be hopeful or just thoughtful the way he was being 99% of the time I'm like god please don't. Still would recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn more about space and doesn't know where to start.!121!Just spend a half a day with this book, time you spend, reading or listening won't be wasted.From the big bang 14 billion years ago, to today. Milky way was formed 9 billion years ago, how it was named? How the planes and asteroids was named? How we fit in the universe, or the universe within us? Kuiper belt and Pluto, and wonder are we all Martians.!121!""The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.""- Neil deGrasse Tyson""People who believe they are ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the universe.""- Neil deGrasse Tyson, Astrophysics for People in a HurryPhysicists are a unique breed. Most people exist in a sphere that is directly impacted by the work of physicists, but only possess a minimal knowledge of some basic Newtonian physics. But even with this gap of knowledge, a few physicists rise to the level of rockstars. Albert Einstein is arguably one of the most recognizable figures of the 20th century. Newton may be one of the most important, and influential, men to have ever lived and exists both in myth and history as a figure almost as important as the founders of major religions (Jesus, Moses, Muhammed). The group of physicists that came to age during the nuclear age also achieved a near rockstar-level reputation and noteriety (Oppenheimer, Fermi, Feynman, etc). In our modern age, a physicist needs to be at one level a genius at math and high-level physics, but also needs to be a great communicator. Neil deGrasse Tyson is almost as much a translator of physics as an astrophysicist in his own right. He bridges that gigantic gulf between the bleeding edge of science and the average person's attention span (not an easy task). He has a talent for understanding his subject, but also getting his audience. He is funny, cheeky, and cognecent that the average reader isn't going to read a 500+ page book on physics (no matter how interesting). So Tyson distills, refines, and delivers just a glimps of what is happening and has happened in the Universe during the last 13.8 Billion years. He does this just as easily in a 140 character tweet as he does in a 208 page book. Some academics are geared toward research and some are geared toward education. Dr. Tyson = Education^3!121!Neil deGrasse Tyson has the gift of helping non-geniuses get a slight clue on what those geniuses are talking about. Slight.Don't even think you can sit down and read this baby in a night. It is definitely a read-a-chapter/think-for-a-bit kind of book. I read a chapter after each fiction book I was reading, and then I would talk about it with my genius son who somehow understands all this stuff. I homeschooled the kid. How does he know so much more than I do? I think he might have been cheating on me!! He was out learning shit on the side! Little bastard!Anyway, like all geniuses, Neil deGrasse Tyson can only dumb stuff down so much, so there are quite a bit of mathmatical and scientific terms in the book that he assumes we can understand. Those geniuses don't get just how dumb we are. See? I know something he doesn't. People are morons. Myself included.Damn! Because pictures really would have helped.Still, I really enjoyed getting less dumberer from reading this. I'm going to read more by NDT and hopefully find something my son doesn't know and rub it in his smug little face. Ha! That'll teach him!!121!I borrowed this book through kindle unlimited. It is an excellent astrophysics book for the layperson.However, it is chock full of scientific information about the universe, electrons, neutrinos, etcetera.A solid 4 stars.!121!Astrophysics is a complex subject. Even years of study barely scratches at the understanding of the universe. Nevertheless, Neil deGrasse Tyson has an amazing ability to make the cosmos fun and understandable. Filled with wonderful ideas -- galaxies devouring dwarf galaxies, massive radio telescopes, a fun run through the periodic table of elements, comets, a study of time --so much is packed into just over 200 pages! Tyson can make the heavy subject engaging, and the strange and ominous fantastically enthralling. I just wish he would leave his political and social agenda out of his scientific presentation. I loved the facts he is an expert with, but I could do without the politics and social theory about which, in my opinion, he has no special knowledge to share. Let's just focus on the matter and energy, please! Tyson is brilliant, but some things in this world are truly subjective.That said, if you don’t mind the author’s platitudes, “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry” is a wonder. It helps you understand a bit of the immensity of space in which we reside, and the extraordinary discoveries we have made in the course of trying to make sense of it all. All the more amazing since some of these discoveries took place over 300 years ago. For some, this may not be the best gateway book if you’re trying to have a better grasp on Astrophysics, but I think this is a lovely addendum for folks that have watched Tyson’s ""Cosmos"" TV series.!121!I believe, and I'm sure many of you agree, that every book has its time. This one's been sitting on my bookshelf since I pre-ordered it. I'm glad I didn't get to it because where better to look than up right now to be uplifted and inspired. Just in our little Milky Way, there are at least a hundred billion suns, probably hundreds of billions and just as many planets with their moons. Planet Earth is just a tiny, insignificant part of a single solar system in a single galaxy. In our universe there are trillions of galaxies and this universe may be a small part of a multiverse. Knowing this doesn't make one's problems go away or the world's, but it's a beautiful direction in which to point your mind. It's entirely possible all of us are made from material that originated on Mars. Neil says he stopped counting moons in our solar system at seventy-nine. As I write it's known that there are at least two hundred moons, and asteroids and comets and a certainty that there are more living things than the ones on Earth. it's humbling, he says. It's also intensely fascinating. Reading this book reminded me of things I'd forgotten and taught me a lot of new things. It had me wrestling with chemistry and physics which generally go over my head -- but it had me wrestling. He never lost me and I never gave up trying to understand parts that were hard for me to comprehend. As he showed in the two seasons of Seth MacFarlane's ""Cosmos,"" Neil is the one you want as your guide to the basics of astronomy which among all the sciences has the most to discover. How exciting! Reading this been an educational, enchanting and uplifting experience. Yesterday a paper was published detailing the discovery of an unprecedented collision of two massive black holes -- which happened 1.3 billion years ago. We are just seeing the light from that collision now. Better and different sorts of telescopes are being developed, other ways to make discoveries involving math and physics and chemistry and -- so much being learned now, in our time, and in our future. How exciting! Thanks to Neil's gift for writing and explaining, his patience and his wit, ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"" is full of wonders and it's wonderful.!121!Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most remarkable scientists of our time, having devoted a large part of his work to popularise astrophysics, one of the most counterintuitive of all fields of science. I loved his “remake” of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos TV show, and this book is in the same vein. As announced in the title, it is a slim pop-science book that can be read in one sitting. It covers a wide field nonetheless: from the Big Bang to black holes and multiverses, to the chemistry of the universe, to life evolution, to exoplanets, to astronomical observatories. Tyson has a knack for making everything quite accessible and even fun to the layperson. He also is an expert in the history of physics and, while covering contemporary subjects (one of his favourites being dark matter and dark energy), he manages to drop a few facts about Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday or Albert Einstein.I remember reading other books written by astrophysicists, like Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time, Trinh Xuan Thuan’s The Secret Melody or Hubert Reeves’ Patience dans l'azur. Somehow, in each case, and probably unbeknownst to their authors, these books have a distinctive poetic flavour, a sort of lyrical flight somehow, which is best expressed in this sentence by the Scottish astronomer James Ferguson, quoted at the end of Tyson’s book:
Of all the sciences cultivated by mankind, Astronomy is acknowledged to be, and undoubtedly is, the most sublime, the most interesting, and the most useful. For, by knowledge derived from this science, not only the bulk of the Earth is discovered . . .; but our very faculties are enlarged with the grandeur of the ideas it conveys, our minds exalted above [their] low contracted prejudices.!121!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is a very readable account of the creation of the universe and how the universe works, as related by Neil deGrasse Tyson.I had this on my watch list for a long time but didn't pull the trigger until it went on sale for $1.99.Since the first movie I saw in the theater was a rerelease of Star Wars sometime in the early 80s, space has always given me a sense of wonder. Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is an easily digestible summation of the universe, from the big bang to the present.Neil deGrasse Tyson breaks down the universe into manageable chunks, from leptons to galaxies. He does a good job with theoretical concepts like dark matter and dark energy, pulsars, quasars, and other flashing bits. Since I've watched many of his appearances, it was easy to hear his voice in my head. There's a fair amount of humor but not enough to distract from all the sciencing going on.Seriously, it's a pop science book about the universe. How much else can I say? If you already know a lot about astrophysics, it's probably not the book for you. However, if all you know about the formation of the universe is dimly remembered things from grade school, you'll probably enjoy it. Since most of my recent scientific knowlege comes from Doctor Who episodes, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Four out of five stars.!121!This book, as its author, is difficult to rate. I am always happy to see ""normal"" people like me interested in sciences instead of not caring or just accepting what they are told instead of questioning and discovering for themselves. Naturally, we can't all be scientists of the first grade, having deep knowledge of every aspect of the natural world (or technology or whatever). However, curiosity only killed the proverbial cat - in reality, it's vital and good.Many people feel clubbed to death, however, when you start conversations about black holes and the theory of relativity, which is not too hard to understand. It's the problem with many teachers, professors, and other lecturers: they lack the charisma to hold people's attention. What is more, if you can't explain something in layman's terms, don't bother.NDT is one of those rare people, who do not only know what they are talking about (more about that further down), but also have a very unique way of HOW he explains phenomena. Some people even call him a rock star of science. And that is where the problems begin.Many people are of the opinion that we should leave science to the experts, much like the Vatican wants us to leave faith to the priests/cardinals/popes and just blindly accept what they put in front of us and that people like NDT are counterproductive by ""dumbing"" complex matters down (funnily enough, the people complaining are NOT scientists themselves). I, as you probably have guessed, disagree.Yes, compromises have to be made when explaining highly complex matters like the beginning of the universe (as much as we know about it at least) to people without any science degree. Nevertheless, the easy way is not always the right way (yes, I just quoted Dumbledore in a review about a science book but I think NDT would approve). As long as people are interested and learn, we - as a society - can only gain from that. Many discoveries have not necessarily been made by people who already had big names or held titles in their respective fields. And even if it only serves to make someone infect their children with a natural thirst for knowledge, it's worth it (when I look around day after day, I see enough people who enjoy sticking their heads in the sand because it's easier to let others do the work for them).Admittedly, even I (very interested in all sciences and reading a lot about different fields) only know half-truths because some things are too difficult to understand by simply reading about them. But knowing half is better than not knowing at all. Especially since it results in me constantly wanting to learn more.So to all people criticizing NDT and people like him, I say this: keep in mind that the guy is a graduate from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science, then went and got a BA in physics from Harvard and a PhD in astrophysics from Columbia, before being with the American Museum of Natural History (NYC) and serving as their Director of the Hayden Planetarium. He knows what he's talking about.The fact that he's a funny guy who can break down the most complex things into an interesting narrative is an added bonus!This book then is his introduction to the topic of astrophysics. In my opinion, even young teenagers can read it. Make no mistake, it's not even scratching the surface, but only tickling it. However (and this is vitally important), it does so in a way that makes you get hundreds of books of secondary literature and really start digging into the respective topics discussed in the 12 chapters of this book. And THAT is how you catch 'em and reel them in! Really, it's a stroke of genius if you think about it. :DNDT plays his cards right. He knows he's charismatic and he knows that people like listening to him because he makes them laugh in an intelligent way. Just look at this photo from the cover:Yep, playing the rock star card. Big-time. But so what?! He's playing to his strengths and we're all benefitting from it!I've seen a few interviews with him, my favourite being when he dismantles someone who verbally attacks him (idiot) about GMOs. Bwahahahahaha! This man's mind is as sharp as a whip and as far as I can tell from what I've seen/listened to/read from him (I'm following his podcast too), he's never been wrong with what he told people. So yeah, I'll read more about the topics in this book and I'll read more of NDT's books. Sometimes it takes a rock star to make you care about the sincere topics.!121!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by Neil deGrasse TysonWhere does one start writing a review of a book like this? So many complex theories, so many names of particles, planets, galaxies, quarks, and quasars. So much physics, theory, and history. Forget about this being a book for people in a ”hurry”, this is complicated stuff. Don’t be in too much of a hurry, take your time when reading this. So, to continue the themes of topsy turvy thinking, upside down confusion and downright blatant ignorance – I will start my review by describing the end of the book.The final chapter Reflections on the cosmic perspective, I found to be utterly profound. After all was said and done in the previous chapters it’s important we think what this is all about. Tyson describes a study were subjects felt ‘insignificant’ when being taught about the universe. A feeling I am sure we have all felt when trying to grapple with such weighty matters. Some of us (me included) have felt the same when pondering the very small world of quantum physics – tiny, tiny particles zipping around sub-atomic space. However, Tyson makes the point to feel inadequate and feel miserable about it, is a measure of our ego. Humankind is such a minuscule part of this wonderful universe; we are no more significant or less significant then all the creatures who live and who have ever lived (Oh my – I love that!!). I mean, numerically we aren’t significant – for example, There are more bacteria in one inch of our colon than all the people who have ever existed. Intellectually, sure we are more intelligent than say Chimps (or Rugby Players) with only a minor genetic variation between us and our furry friends (the Chimps). But what’s to say there are no other intelligent life forms out there, more intelligent than us caused by an equally miniscule genetic variation? Imagine what they could do? Calculus in the womb? The Count from Sesame Street playing with the imponderable infinity?Perhaps, feeling more humility about our place in this universe (and Earth) is a good thing. Reflecting on our place as just one member of a family of life and matter. Understanding we are breathing oxygen previously breathed by others, drinking water once consumed and urinated by all manner of life forms, using Carbon atoms in our essential biochemical molecules handed down to us by forests and algae. In fact, we’ve been recycling for millennia. We are very much a part of this world, Solar System, Galaxy and Universe/s - but we’re not in charge of it. The universe is indeed a cold, dispassionate place but the most beautiful thing one could ever imagine. I was moved entirely with Tyson’s closing thoughts, not because of my lack of theism and the congruence of his thinking with mine (although that always helps) – but because it makes sense and truly puts this reader at total peace with how things are.Onto the science....The chapter on Invisible Light was one of the most fascinating. The discovery of invisible light, that is, light with wavelengths longer than red in our rainbow such as infra-red and radio waves and the discovery of those wavelengths shorter than violet in our rainbow such as ultra-violet, x-rays and those nasty gamma rays. Importantly, he describes what we do with these invisible light rays, particularly with regards to astronomy, how we detect various rays of invisible light to study different features of our universe.Dark Matter and Dark Energy featured heavily. This stuff makes up 27% and 68% of the universe respectively, leaving only 5% for the stuff we can see – like planets and stars. It’s this 95% of stuff we know hardly anything, or nothing about that make scientists incredibly excited. These were ‘discovered’ when Hubble showed the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, not being retarded by the pull of gravity. Hence, some other form of energy is pushing the universe to expand it faster and faster. Maybe the next Newton or Einstein is in utero, right now, ready to unleash his or her intellect on solving the mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Surely that’s not much of an ask – expecting answers to the misunderstood 95% of the universe. It’ll happen – to be sure.Tyson describes Einstein as a “Bad Ass”. Meaning he was strutting his stuff in his theoretical physics world, with just his mind and something to write with – and really clever experimental physicists since have confirmed his theories such as The Theory of General Relativity and Quantum Theory. Einstein’s remarkable work has truly stood the test of time. So, if you want to have your mind spiked into action in a smart, easily digestible (mostly) way – this is a book for you. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Tyson which was excellent, and I found it added to the experience. This book needs a re-listen – for example, next time I might be more interested in the chapter on Between the Galaxies and can read up on that topic and bore family and friends shitless again. Why not?Blistering and magical 5-Stars!121!3.5 starsNeil DeGrasse TysonNeil DeGrasse Tyson, an American astrophysicist, is the Director of the Hayden Planetarium, and the host of 'Star Talk' and 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.' Tyson is also a very funny guy, and his sense of humor lightens the 'lessons' in Astrophysics for People in a Hurry - which contains a brief overview of cosmology.I'll just touch on some topics in the book I found interesting.....some new, some not so much.******Fourteen billion years ago the universe was teeny tiny, 'a trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.' It exploded in 'The Big Bang' and expanded at a phenomenal rate - one second after the big bang the universe was already several light years across (at least 18 trillion miles). The Big BangBy then, the forces we're familiar with had formed: gravity, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force. At the same time, a large array of particles had appeared, including photons, electrons, neutrinos, quarks, and more....all the stuff that makes up 'matter.' For the first billion years the universe continued to expand and cool, and matter coalesced into galaxies. Scientists estimate that there are about 100 billion galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars. Debris around some stars merged to form planets, and Earth formed in a 'Goldilocks' zone where oceans remain liquid.....allowing life as we know it to develop.Matter coalesced into galaxies*****Sir Isaac NewtonAfter Sir Isaac Newton determined the laws of gravity, scientists discovered that physical forces are uniform throughout the universe. Tyson notes, ""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."" The astrophysicist has a fun story about this: When Tyson told a waiter that his hot cocoa had no whipped cream, the server insisted it had sunk to the bottom. But whipped cream has low density, and floats. So Tyson gave the waiter two options: ""Either someone forgot to add whipped cream or the universal laws of physics are different in this restaurant."" LOL Cosmic background radiation (CMB), seen in every direction we look, is the microwave radiation emitted by the cooling universe 380,000 years after the big bang. It's the remnant of something that was once enormously bright, but now requires special instruments to observe.CMB was first seen by two American physicists that worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories. They accidentally discovered CMB while trying to develop new channels of communication for AT&T.....and later won the Nobel Prize for this achievement (so that's a nice perk!). *****Ordinary matter makes up everything we see and feel. It has gravity and interacts with light. However, this ordinary stuff makes up only 15 to 20 percent of the universe. A full 80 to 85 percent of the cosmos is made of a mysterious substance called 'dark matter', which has gravity but doesn't interact with light. Scientists have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what this is. As if dark matter isn't sufficiently enigmatic, the universe also contains a large amount of 'dark energy.' This is a kind of 'negative gravity' that's pushing the universe apart - accelerating its expansion. As a result, anything not gravitationally connected to the Milky Way Galaxy (where we live) will rush away at an ever increasing speed. So galaxies that are now visible to our telescopes will eventually disappear from view. Tyson notes, ""In a trillion years, anyone alive in the Milky Way may know nothing of other galaxies, and will see nothing but a dark, endless void."" :(*****William and Caroline HerschelIn 1781, British astronomer William Herschel discovered a new planet in our solar system. He wanted to name it after his King, in which case the planets would be called: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and George. More traditional heads prevailed, and planet was named Uranus. :)*****To communicate with life elsewhere in the universe - who probably wouldn't understand our spoken languages (just watch the 2016 movie 'Arrival') - we would have to use the language of science. The Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, carries a plaque that shows humans, our solar system, our location in the Milky Way Galaxy, and the structure of hydrogen and the atom.Voyager Plaque It also carries a gold record album that has whale sounds, and music from Beethoven, Chuck Berry, and others. Tyson mentions that his favorite parody of this 'gift' is an old skit on Saturday Night Live, in which we receive a written reply from the aliens that asks ""Send more Chuck Berry."" Ha ha haVoyager Record******Tyson's book has lots more interesting information about the universe - and how we study it. On the (slight) downside - since the book is based on a series of essays - it's a little repetitive. And there's a section on elements that veers off the topic of astrophysics.I'd highly recommend this 'astrophysics light' book to non-specialists interested in the subject. (If you're a physicist, you presumably know all this already.) In this life I've studied tons of biology and geology. In my next life I'd like to be an astrophysicist who solves the mystery of dark matter and dark energy. :)You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....!121!“Ray, pretend for a moment that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.” – Dr. Peter VenkmanAs a matter of fact, Ray, I DID study, though it was more than 20 years ago, so it’s entirely possible I’ve forgotten a thing or two…so you can suck it. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s book is a joy. Do you need to have some basic grounding in physics to understand and appreciate it? Yes. If you have some basic grounding in physics, will you still be totally overwhelmed and perplexed by some of the ideas it presents? I certainly hope so, or else I’m an idiot (which is entirely possible…okay, probable). But, Tyson has a gift for making the impossibly complex digestible, and this brief overview of some of the most fascinating topics in astrophysics (not dissimilar, though slightly more reader friendly, than Rovelli's Seven Brief Lessons on Physics) is not only enlightening and entertaining, it also provides ample food for thought and a much-needed reason to reflect on things that transcend the day-to-day insanity we call life these days. It’s difficult to grasp the overwhelming size of space when you struggle to figure out how to properly fold a pizza box (as some of us do—shut up), but it’s intellectually rewarding to wrestle with concepts that challenge your brain and force you to think in a different way.Highly recommended for people who want a better grasp of a fascinating scientific arena and who want to sound smart in 30-second soundbites at parties (though be warned that follow-up questions will leave you doing the verbal equivalent of fumbling with a pizza box).!121!Short and sweet introduction to astrophysics. Science was bit basic for me as I posses some knowledge of the subject but it's perfect gift for my nephew who has shown interest and keeps asking me to explain this stuff to him. Neil deGrasse Tyson is great with words and simple explanations of complicated things. His writing style is fun and even funny at times and makes all of this sound incredibly cool. That in combination with very short length makes this book perfect if you are trying to set child onto the righteous path of nerd or trying to convert an adult.Also I plan to get it as hardcopy for my nephew but I listened to audiobook version and Tyson's narration is just marvelous.!121!What a fun science book!I have always been a science nut and had to get this book! The library was backed up so I know I wasn't the only one. I truly love the way he teaches the reader science on the reader's level without talking down to us. So many fun, witty remarks that stick the info in your head helps. He makes science fun! No wonder the kids these days know him, besides the fact he 'killed Pluto'. LOL. Wonderful book and I learned and laughed.!121!3.5 StarsThis rating may be more reflective of my personal tastes than the book itself, as this is definitely about large-scale, broad-spectrum science. My interests always veer towards understanding people and the world around me, less than wondering about our beginnings or the scope of the cosmos. As much as I want to learn, all the theoreticals tend to bore me. But, this book does a really great job of presenting the material from a grounded, real-world approach. Tyson uses funny anecdotes (my favorite is the one about whipped cream and gravity) to help explain these strange, difficult concepts, and it's overall very well done. Plus that chapter on Dark Matter? Spooky and all types of interesting.At the end of the day, I can't rate this any-higher, because I still zoned out more often than I want to admit. But, I was less confused than I thought I'd be, and more interested than I thought I'd be, so that's something?!121!I had different expectations about this book, and the problem is likely me and not the book. The book explains astrophysics, or what we know to date about this subject from the beginning (the Big Bang) to today and also the possible future. Everything is explained theoretically and clarified as that.I love reading about science facts and that's what I expected but the subject is astrophysics which is defined as: ""the branch of astronomy concerned with the physical nature of stars and other celestial bodies, and the application of the laws and theories of physics to the interpretation of astronomical observations."" (source)So clearly I didn't have an idea of what I was getting into. However, the definition of astrophysics was clarified while reading this book. Neil deGrasse Tyson does an excellent job of explaining these complex ideas and putting it in simple, understandable terms. A lot of the concepts went over my head and require abstract thinking from the part of the reader. I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, he did a wonderful job at that. Overall I liked it but did not love it. I recommend it to all those interested in the cosmos, astrophysics, dark matter and other theoretical subjects. Review posted on blog.FINAL NOTE: The author is very charismatic and if you follow him on twitter you probably have realized this by now. His tweets are poignant, interesting and funny.!121!I guess I’m not in that much of a hurry! Or I’m just not very bright. This book is not accessible for the average person, in a hurry or otherwise. I was lost really early on and trust me, things didn’t get clearer with time. It felt like a convoluted textbook to me. I will accept all the blame for my totally honest take on this book: I hated it. My biggest takeaway was that I’m not interested in astrophysics at all...and I’m okay with that!!121!I know that Neil deGrasse Tyson has been the new poster child of capital-S Science in the last few years, but I have lived in blissful ignorance. I didn't watch Cosmos, for instance. But I like astrophysics, the parts I can grasp, and have an admiration for people who can grasp the science and math and concepts enough to push our understanding forward.This is a short book, and I will recommend the audio read by the author. He is very passionate and exuberant about his topics, and it still came across a bit sped up (which I felt it needed.) The different chapters are sometimes previous essays, compiled into this layman's overview of astrophysics - intentionally short, concepts boiled down to the core of where our understanding started, what we know now, and what we do not know. It's clear that the one thing we really have gained understanding of is all that we do not know!I was least thrilled by the periodical table chapter, but I get it, the elements are not unique to earth, and that can be used as evidence for some things, mostly things I'm not super interested in the debate on. But I loved his cosmic perspective and where humanity fits as much as I loved his visual description of what the galaxies looked like in the past, and his questions about the things that we can never know we don't know because they are gone. This is the best science book I've read all year, and possibly also the only science book I will have read this year.!121!Actually, if you're in a hurry to understand astrophysics, might want give that pipe dream up. Although this book is a brilliant and well written group of essays by one of the greatest minds of our time, it is not a quick read.  I'll grant ya that it's not a huge tome, but the amount of info on every page is amazing. I often had to put it down and let just a few lines sink in.  If you truly want to grasp even just the edges of astrophysics you won't read this book in a hurry. You will take the time to savor every sentence.!121!I have always been more of a words person than a numbers person. I stopped enjoying science in school when numbers got involved, somewhere around Honors Chemistry. This book was perfect for me. Written in an engaging, approachable style, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry has reignited my interest in science, particularly in astronomy. I learned a lot, only by rereading passages several times and then putting the book down to think for a few minutes before continuing, but mostly I came away with a sense of amazement and humility in the face of the universe and the people so much smarter than me that study it.The last thirty pages were so profound, just so shockingly profound and inspiring, that I actually feel differently about the world and my place in it. And now I’m off to watch Cosmos and probably order another NDT book to read once my brain recovers from this one.!121!Neil deGrasse Tyson is cool. No question. He doesn't pack much into this short book, but whatever he does talk about is always cool. Even too cool sometimes. Sagan used to awe us with this stuff, but deGrasse Tyson makes it easy to feel like a nerd, by oversimplifying concepts and letting some of his smooth arrogance pass onto the reader.But, there are always enough nuggets to keep your true inner nerd interested: Like when he explains how Quarks have fractional charges that come in thirds, and that the force that keeps two or more of them together actually grows stronger the more you separate them... Wow, right? And the whole discussion on dark energy and dark matter is the coolest bit, because Tyson is at his best in dealing with still unexplored bits of the subject.All in all, Tyson's geeky, aloof, arrogant voice remains consistent through this book as well - and those of us who derive pleasure from a likeable know-it-all like Tyson talking down to know-nothings, will enjoy every bit of it. Especially, when the arrogance arising from the backing of science and its capabilities are laced with just the right dose of Sagan-like, pale-blue-dot-like humility about how the arrow of knowledge always gives us humans a smaller and smaller role in the universe.!121!It was interesting and full of information about the universe. A few chapters go into more detail than others and I didn't ""get"" everything, science wise. But I did get a few good ideas for stories!!121!***I received an advance reader copy of this book from Netgalley for an honest review***I love Neil deGrasse Tyson and the way he so easily puts concepts into terms regular people can understand. I love how excited he gets about the universe. This short and simple book is a great intro to our place in the universe. Also, watch the documentary ""We are Stars"" at your local planetarium if you get the chance (this book and that documentary go very well together). I ❤ science!!121!All right, what we have here is a failure to communicate. Say what?!I guess I should start with Astrophysics for Dummies . . . Nah, just forget it.I'm having a good laugh at my reading aspirations right now. I think I'll content myself with stargazing and wondering.I am not worthy to rate this book.!121!3/23/2020 - I have suffered with some insomnia lately, what with all the chaos going on in the world right now. I found that turning the television on in the bedroom with the volume on low works well to quiet my insanely hyperactive mind, especially if the voices are soothing and calming. Some of my favorites: any of those documentary shows that deal with oceans and animals and such, the shows about our vast universe, and Bob Ross. The voices are super quiet and there are no drastic/sudden increases in volume to shock me out of my almost sleep. While flipping through the YouTube app on my TV last night to find something, I came across the audiobook version of this that had been posted. (Hint hint the audiobook is free on YouTube hint hint). I read the book in 2017 so I didn’t necessarily need to read it again, but I know that Neil’s voice was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, I had the volume a little too high and got interested again in how well he explains mind-blowing science. Do I understand it all? Heck no. But that wasn’t the intention of the book. The intention was sort of to make me understand that I didn’t understand anything, that the universe is so much more complicated than anyone can understand in a 3.5 hour audiobook reading. It helps me understand what some very intelligent people are doing to figure out some things that even they don’t know yet. 3.5 hours later, I was still awake but much more at peace. And sleep finally came. 6/6/2017 Original Review - Sadly, this is just more proof that the universe doesn't revolve around me. I highly recommend the audiobook, read by Neil himself. His voice is soothing, and the astrophysics seem somehow easier to understand coming directly from him.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Audiobook', 'Physics', 'Space', 'Astronomy', 'History']"
Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup (Hardcover),John Carreyrou,4.41,258260,2018,"The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup ""unicorn"" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at The Wall Street Journal, got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the Journal were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.","""The resignations infuriated Elizabeth and Sunny. The following day, they summoned the staff for an all-hands meeting in the cafeteria. Copies of The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho had been placed on every chair. Elizabeth told the gathered employees that she was building a religion. If there was anyone not prepared to show complete devotion and unmitigated loyalty to the company they should “get the fuck out.”The Steve Jobs SyndromeI have covered Silicon Valley as a journalist and author for three decades now. I’m not big on attending conferences, but made a point to go to an awards event at a favorite forum in September 2015. Among the recipients that year was Silicon Valley legend, Andy Grove, getting the lifetime achievement award.Also on the list, getting the “global benefactor” award at this 2015 event, was someone I had never heard of, Elizabeth Holmes. I had also never heard of her company, Theranos. Though I once worked for a business magazine, I never read any others. And Theranos was in the medical device “space,” which is pretty different from software and social media.Her presentation was last. Joining her on stage was her Stanford professor and mentor, Channing Robertson. He spoke first. He told this story of Holmes as a kind of prodigy who camped out at the doors of his office and lab until he admitted her as a freshman into his upper division courses in chemical engineering. I would learn later that he considered Holmes a once-in-a-generation genius, comparing her to Newton, Einstein, Mozart, and Leonardo da Vinci. Heavy praise, indeed.Holmes was up next. She wore a black, mock turtleneck that reminded me of Steve Jobs. Her dyed blond hair was up, slightly skewed, that struck me as a bit calculated. She had large, unblinking blue eyes and spoke in a low baritone. By the end of her talk, it struck me that she had essentially said nothing of substance about her product or her company. Instead, it was high-falutin’ claims that reminded me of the rhetoric Steve Jobs used when rolling out a new product, except that he had a real product he was demonstrating each time. I was immediately suspicious of Holmes and Theranos. I had seen too much over the years to take something like this at face value.When I got home, I did a computer search and learned that Holmes had been on the cover of numerous business magazines as the first female tech billionaire. (My wife would always add: “on paper.”) In some photos she posed with a tiny vial of blood that was supposed to represent all that would be needed to do numerous tests with the company device.Almost a month later, the first in a series of Wall Street Journal articles about Theranos, by the author of this book, were published. It reported that their technology did not work. (I was to learn later that the author interviewed 60 former Theranos employees for his research). My suspicions were confirmed. I eagerly read every new installment of the WSJ series.But “Bad Blood” goes much deeper than those articles. It turns out that Channing Robertson was not the only older man over whom Holmes had a kind of hypnotic power, like the mythical Mata Hari. There was veteran venture capitalist, Donald L. Lucas, whose backing and connections enabled Holmes to keep raising money. Then Dr. J and Wade Miquelon at Walgreens and Safeway CEO Steve Burd, as well as General James Mattis (now Trump’s Secretary of Defense), George Shultz, and Henry Kissinger. All of these men served as enablers, when they were in positions where they could have put a stop to the fraud. Most of these operations had experts who knew the science and tried to warn their superiors, but were ignored. And there’s no doubt that the medical miracles Theranos promised were very appealing to these older men, as well as to so many others who heard her spiel. One of the most important older men was Sunny Balwani, her romantic partner 20 years her senior. He knew nothing about science, but was essentially her primary henchman for bullying dissenters in the company, heading up employee surveillance and doing the dirty work of firing people. He also subbed as CFO after the only one they had was fired for questioning company honesty. Balwani would pull numbers out of his butt and claim they were legitimate revenue projections.Those who weren’t fooled were veteran venture capitalists who had been investing in the medical device space for years. During one of her pitches to these firms, she was asked so many questions she couldn’t answer that she stormed out of the conference room. In a one-on-one encounter with another successful venture capitalist he asked to see her device. Instead, she slapped her notebook shut and said: “if you can’t trust me, I can’t work with you” and slammed the door behind her as she departed.In turns out that in spite of her time at Stanford, Holmes didn’t know much science. She described the process of her device as follows….“A chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel.”The selling point was no more needles, just a slight lance of a fingertip could provide enough blood to do countless tests. When the author queried Timothy Hamill, from the UCSF Department of Laboratory Science, he told him…""….the pitfalls of using blood pricked from a finger. Unlike venous blood drawn from the arm, capillary blood was polluted by fluids from tissues and cells that interfered with tests and made measurements less accurate. “I’d be less surprised if they told us they were time travelers who came back from the twenty-seventh century than if they told us they cracked that nut,” he added.[It's odd that Holmes continues to be referred to as ""brilliant"" when she lacked knowledge of the basic science noted above]The whole concept was flawed from the beginning. Holmes used non-company technology to try to cover this up. In a PowerPoint presentation she made to investors one slide showed scatter plots purporting to favorably compare test data from Theranos’s proprietary analyzers to data from conventional lab machines. But all the data came from non-Theranos technology. They often used other tech than company technology that could not generate accurate results for patients. Theranos even resorted to using hypodermic needles, instead of the promised fingertip prick. Meanwhile, Holmes continued to expand her Steve Jobs persona. She drank green kale shakes (Jobs was vegan), leased cars with no license plates (as he had), had several bodyguards who referred to her as Eagle1 (Eagle2 was Balwani) and flew in a Gulfstream Jet. She referred to her device as the i-Pod of Health. And even hired the ad and pr firm that Apple once used, Chiat-Day, even though Theranos could not afford them. And looking back, it appeared that her dropping out of college was part of a script, just the way Jobs and Gates dropped out to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.When she went on the Jim Cramer’s “Mad Money” show to denounce the WSJ, she sounded very Jobs-like when she said: “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, and then, all of a sudden, you change the world.“Not surprisingly, Theranos kept missing their deadlines. Its contract with Safeway fell through, but Walgreen’s was more important to them. Several stores in Arizona went “live” with testing. Most tests done there were way off, resulting in unnecessary trips to the ER and potential over-treatment. Various doctors and patients published negative reviews on Yelp. This put the company in the realm of reckless endangerment: “a crime consisting of acts that create a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.”This reality upset many employees who wanted no part of a fraud that would harm people. At company meetings, Holmes would say: “If anyone here believes you are not working on the best thing humans have ever built, then you should leave.”Many took her up on that, but it was never without controversy. Meanwhile, bulldog Sunny was dispatched to Arizona to intimidate those who had posted negative Yelp reviews. And the company had hired super-lawyer David Boies to threaten suit against anyone who revealed insider info on the company. Just as one example, it cost the Schulz family $400k in legal fees to defend George’s nephew Tyler. Theranos knew Tyler had met with the author because they had a tail on both Tyler and the author.When I finished the book I thought back on that awards ceremony I had attended where I first saw Holmes. I recalled Andy Grove, whose lifetime achievement award represented the original Silicon Valley of sweat equity. Grove lived through the Nazi occupation of his native country of Hungary and escaped after it became Communist. In New York, he worked as a busboy while he learned English and obtained a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from City College of New York. Graduate work took him to the west coast, where he earned a Ph.D from U.C. Berkeley in chemical engineering. He would go on to help found chip maker, Intel, a company that truly changed the world.These days, what I see in Silicon Valley is an increasing obsession with wealth and an absence of ethics, and the spread of the Steve Jobs Syndrome, like some kind of disease. Theranos epitomized all of this. The result is a lack of the honest work that Grove epitomized, in which wealth and notoriety were by-products not goals. The real goal was to do good work, first and foremost. And always tell the truth.======And the beat goes on, Sam Bankman-Fried and Crypto and the new Michael Lewis book and some looking for AI to bring Silicon Valley and San Francisco back again in a good way.!121!I don’t read a lot of page turners. I often find myself unable to put a book down—but they’re not the kinds of books that would keep most people glued to their chairs. Still, I recently found myself reading a book so compelling that I couldn’t turn away.Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou details the rise and fall of Theranos. If you aren’t familiar with the Theranos story, here’s the short version: the company promised to quickly give you a complete picture of your health using only a small amount of blood. Elizabeth Holmes founded it when she was just 19 years old, and both she and Theranos quickly became the darlings of Silicon Valley. She gave massively popular TED talks and appeared on the covers of Forbes and Fortune.By 2013, Theranos was valued at nearly $10 billion and even partnered with Walgreens to put their blood tests in stores around the country. The problem? Their technology never worked. It never came close to working. But Holmes was so good at selling her vision that she wasn’t stopped until after real patients were using the company’s “tests” to make decisions about their health. She and her former business partner are now facing potential jail time on fraud charges, and Theranos officially shut down in August.The public didn’t know about Theranos’ deception until Carreyrou broke the story as a reporter at the Wall Street Journal. Because he was so integral to the company’s demise, Bad Blood offers a remarkable inside look.Some of the details he shares are—for lack of a better word—insane. Holmes would invite prospective investors to the lab, so they could get their blood tested on a Theranos machine. The device had been programmed to show a really slow progress bar instead of an error message. When results didn’t come back right away, Holmes sent the investors home and promised to follow up with results.As soon as they left, an employee would remove the blood sample from the device and transfer it to a commercial blood analyzer. Her investors got their blood tested by the same machines available in any lab in the country, and they had no idea.There’s a lot Silicon Valley can learn from the Theranos mess. To start, a company needs relevant experts on its board of directors. The Theranos board had some heavy hitters—including several former Cabinet secretaries and senators—but for most of the company’s existence, none of them had any expertise in diagnostics. If they had, they might have noticed the red flags a lot sooner.Health technology requires a different approach than other kinds of technology, because human lives are on the line. Carreyrou writes a lot about how Holmes idolized Steve Jobs and his unwillingness to compromise on his vision. That approach is okay for consumer electronics—if a new phone doesn’t work as promised, no one gets hurt—but it’s irresponsible for a health company. Holmes pushed a vision of what Theranos could be, not what it actually was, and people suffered as a result.Bad Blood is also a cautionary tale about the virtues of celebrity. On the surface, Holmes was everything Silicon Valley loves in a CEO: charismatic and convincing with a memorable personal story made for magazine profiles. There’s nothing wrong with that on its own. A rock star CEO can be a huge boon for a startup. But you can’t let fame become the most important thing.Theranos is the worst-case scenario of what happens when a CEO prioritizes personal legacy above all else—but I hope that people don’t use it as an excuse to write off the next young woman with a big idea. I also don’t want Bad Blood to scare people away from next-gen diagnostics. Theranos went to extraordinary lengths to get around quality standards. The industry is highly regulated, and new diagnostics undergo rigorous testing.Bad Blood tackles some serious ethical questions, but it is ultimately a thriller with a tragic ending. It’s a fun read full of bizarre details that will make you gasp out loud. The story almost feels too ridiculous to be real at points (no wonder Hollywood is already planning to turn it into a movie). I think it’s the perfect book to read by the fire this winter.!121!Fascinating accounting of the Theranos scam and I do mean SCAM. Exhaustively reported. I do wish there had been more analysis of how a scam of this magnitude was made possible and enabled. This girl dropped out of college and convinced Henry Kissinger, George Schulz, Rupert Murdoch and a bunch of other famous and/or incredibly talented people to give her money or work with her even though there was no there, there. WHAT? There are so many incredible WTF moments. Just wow. Privilege is a hell of a drug, I guess.!121!Tips on how to make an unicorn:- Be a sociopath- Excel at sales&marketing- Get some cool people on your BoardTips to how to fake it till you make it?- Hire a lot of lawyers- Intimidate all your employees- Pretend that you are a vocal proponent of a cause that you are actually againstHow to make it as a woman in the tech world?- Baritone- Intese staringWhat can fuck up your amazing future as a tech billionaire?- Facts and data :( I love any story that shows how sales&marketing can change the world. This one is awesome. Scary, but awesome.!121!Last night when I finished this I just wanted to write a review that was haha repeated like four hundred times. I've gotten some sleep since then and calmed down though. This was really good, like I stayed up until 3 am reading because I didn't want to put it down good. Most I'm just befuddled that this happened at all and at the fact that most of the people implicated in this are just probably never going to face any repercussions. I don't even necessarily mean legal repercussions but like just there seems like there's zero contrition or embarrassment on the part of people like George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, James N. Mattis, or Channing Robertson. Like just their instance until even recently that Theranos has proprietary technology that was novel and that there wasn't merit to anything being said, or the way Mattis was even confirmed as Secretary of Defense not too long ago. I'm just baffled and I think the book shouldn't have said Holmes was solely responsible for the mess that was Theranos when so many people who we're supposed to think as credible couldn't be bothered to do any due diligence. When Schultz's own grandson came to him to tell him that things weren't right at Theranos and he just disregarded him. I honestly couldn't even comprehend how someone could be like that, but I guess what else can you expect from someone involved in something like the Iran-Contra affair. Really good book, would totally recommend, personally could not look away from this god damn train wreck of a situation that was entirely preventable.!121!Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou is a 2018 Knopf Publishing Group publication. ‘Super high turnover rate means you’re never bored at work. Also good if you’re an introvert because each shift is short-staffed. Especially if you’re swing or graveyard. You essentially don’t exist to the company.Why be bothered with lab coats and safety goggles? You don’t need to use PPE at all. Who cares if you catch something like HIV or Syphilis? This company sure doesn’t!! Brown nosing, or having a brown nose, will get you far. How to make money at Theranos:1.	Lie to venture capitalists2.	Lie to doctors, patients, FDA, CDC, government. While also committing highly unethical and immoral (and possibly illegal) acts. This is the story of Elizabeth Holmes’ meteoric rise and her swift and spectacular fall from grace-I didn’t closely follow this case in the same way I do some true crime stories, but I did keep up with it enough to get the gist of what had transpired, who some of the players were, and why the company was sued. So, when I saw this book, I knew I wanted to read it. I had to know all the details, the how, when, where, and why because it was just such a bizarre situation. However, after I read this book, I sat back in complete shock. Sometimes, I just could not believe what I was reading!! I also couldn’t believe all the names that popped up in this book!! Before anyone starts pointing fingers at one side of the other, people from all political stripes were misled by the charismatic Holmes. These people are supposed to be the best and the brightest, but frankly, every one of them left me with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. For those who many not have kept up with the news stories-Elizabeth Holmes, barely out of her teens, was behind a Silicon Valley startup called Theranos. The company claimed to have invented a device that could take a very small amount a blood, usually from a single finger prick, and perform as many as eight hundred different tests on it, often promising instant results or diagnosis. The demonstrations showed mixed results, so to be sure the results wowed the potential investor, the tests were often rigged. Any unfavorable statistics were simply tossed out or ignored. The device and its potential capabilities were pitched to Safeway, Walgreens, and even the Military. Elizabeth’s magnetic personality was enthralling, and she had a way of convincing people to do what she wanted them to, persuading even the most skeptical to put their faith and trust in her. However, multitudes of her employees found out the hard way, what might happen if they challenged her, or her Svengali -like lover Ramesh ‘Sunny’ Balwani. Many people were disturbed by the false claims Elizabeth made and were very concerned about the false positive results the blood tests produced on real patients. Employees at the company dropped like flies. Eventually, one employee, Tyler Shultz, grandson of former secretary of state, George Shultz, became a whistleblower, bringing down a nine -billion -dollar operation in the process. This story is utterly chilling, and mind boggling. I marveled at the gullibility of people we entrust our lives to, not only at the base level of health care, but at high levels of the government and the military. I’d have thought some of the people were smarter than that. Apparently not. Look, even someone like me, from Podunk, Texas, would know better than to take a medical claim such as this one at face value. I wouldn’t invest in it, promote it, or test it on patients until the thing had been approved by the FDA or whoever else had to put the seal of approval on it. I damn sure wouldn’t allow our military to be subjected to something so unreliable. Good God! Is common sense dead in the water? It just seemed too far-fetched to me and I really struggled to believe so many wealthy and even powerful people fell under Holmes’ spell so completely.Which of course brings us to the core issue: At the center of all this is Elizabeth Holmes- a greedy sociopath, a megalomaniac- or whatever word you want to use. This woman’s behavior is unconscionable!! She really should be behind bars!! This is a crazy story, just nuts!! You will have to read it to believe it. Now, as far an investigative or true crime book goes- this one is above average, especially give the journalistic background of the author. At times all the medical testing and lab jargon was a bit dry, and sometimes the information or patterns of all the players felt repetitive. The organization of the material was well done, but not as tight as I would have liked. Still, I am thankful the author pursued this story for the WSJ, writing an article which helped to bring down this dangerous company before any truly horrific damage was done!! Theranos ceased operations in August of 2018- Thank God! Holmes and Balwani face up to twenty years in prison-4 stars!121!This was fucking BANANAS.!121!Lessons learned:1. Elizabeth Holmes speaks in an unusually deep voice.2. What matters is who you know. If you look good and have the right connections, you can get millions of dollars for your imaginary device, particularly if you model it on the iPhone and dress like Steve Jobs.3. Even very rich people can be stupid with money.4. Sometimes the people that aren’t stupid are just supporting you for the grift.Rather outside my normal genres of mystery, sci-fi and fantasy, Bad Blood intrigued me both because of its medical focus and because I heard it was a particularly well-done story. Although I will once again offer up a more appropriate title: Bad Blood Tech, because the blood itself here is perfectly fine. Absolutely normal, in fact. Perfectly healthy blood that’s put into a nefarious machine, sold by a flim-flam operator of the highest level.The storytelling is very straight-forward, generally devoid of literary flourishes and with only minor asides. In fact, at times the writing seems simplistic. On reflection, I think Carreyrou had to keep his sentences as factual as possible, knowing that Holmes’ lawyers would go over every word looking to dispute it. As such, it reads quickly. Until, that is, you you develop Toxic Exposure Syndrome, the experience of immersing yourself in the world of unrepentant and awful people. I found I had to take a break, and once stopped, was reluctant to pick it up. I solved my little dilemma by reading backwards, and was relieved to discover that the narrative eventually switches from the meteoric ‘rise’ of Thantos to the development of the Wall Street Journal‘s expose. That’s when the crazy took an actively evil direction with Thantos harassing former employees, potential sources, and anyone who might speak to Carreyrou about Thantos.What surprised me the most about this story is how many people Elizabeth Holmes was able to convince to part with their money. Sure, it seems she genuinely believed in her product and its potential. But the goal was a product used to test blood for diagnostic purposes. Even the most simple nurse (cough-cough) could tell you that there’s certification involved. This isn’t a Kickstarter for your new book, or a new design for luggage, or even an up-and-coming app that will tell you if the concert you are at will burst your eardrums (this is a thing). Tests almost always have to be run past the FDA. And Holmes never showed anyone proof of such things. Essentially, thanks to an impressive amount of seed money through family connections, she was able to keep her pyramid scam going by finding new people and just enough opportunities to parlay small successes into looking like big ones. Until they turned to outright lies. I will note that many of the scientists and engineers she hired did ultimately quit after sharing their (ethical) concerns with their boss, whose response seems to have been, 'don't worry about it.'I do have to thank Carreyrou, though. We were sitting around work in the break room the other day, in our fifteen by fifteen space shared by roughly twenty people a shift, and someone was commiserating on how awful our jobs were right now. “Well,” I said, “at least we have our souls.”Three stars, through no fault of the Author. I just didn't enjoy reading about a rampant narcissist and her team of parasitic lawyers.!121!If you are working in the Health care or the Engineering sector, or if you are interested in Business, start-ups, or Tech firms, or if you love page-turners, this is one of the best books you can read. 

 CEOs like Elizabeth Holmes, who were manipulative and lacked empathy, should never come to the Health care, which will put millions of innocent people's lives in jeopardy just like what Theranos did by giving false Medical reports.!121!Early in my career I worked at a next-generation sequencing startup with Theranos-level ambitions. In fact, it went further. The founders’ mission was to cure aging. Literally, the goal was immortality.There were other similarities: The company was founded by wunderkinds, they won the attention and support of a prominent professor in the field, they dropped out and raised millions of dollars from non-hard tech investors off the back of a concept, then tens of millions of dollars off the back of a glued together prototype, all while pursuing a fantastical goal.The company was wild but not fraudulent. Quite the contrary: When the founders realized that the technology was not going to work (or would take many more years to validate) they decided to fold the company. All of the scientists - even the skeptics - were shocked and disappointed. We were on the verge of breaking through in key areas. But, it was over.And, the irony? Many of those scientists went on to work at Theranos. It was just down the street.By 2012 they had all left Theranos. ‘It's too crazy’. ‘It’s way worse’. Way worse than an immature company that blew up on a whim? I started following Theranos: the Glassdoor reviews, the funding announcements, the glowing press coverage. It was surreal to know that the company was a fraud and yet to see it rise.Carreyrou exposed it all. How Holmes and Balwani drove an employee to suicide, how they strong-armed employees, investors, even generals and statesmen, how they lied to win multi-million dollar deals from credulous partners. The pulp in Bad Blood is juicy. I read the book on one overseas flight.Theranos is extreme but not singular. Silicon Valley lionizes founders and ‘overnight’, 100X successes. Investors are pushed & pulled toward a hands-off approach. Founders retain board control and investors don’t meddle. This environment is prime for fraud. My management philosophy: In a vacuum, everyone cuts corners. Everyone gets lazy. And, unscrupulous people do worse.A couple years ago I tweeted: ‘At what point do high-profile unicorn frauds irreparably damage the philosophy and practice of founder-friendly investors?’ That was about Hampton Creek. It could have been about Zenefits, or Uber (in a sense), or, of course, Theranos. Who will be next? The odds-on favorite is WeWork. Does Tesla (a public company) count? The whisper-consensus has many candidates.There are many frauds left to be exposed. But, none as big as Theranos. Well, maybe one or two.!121!The True Cost of IdealismI have been guilty of the grave fault of idealism in much of my professional life. Consequently I cringe when I read of the young Elizabeth Holmes and her idealistic trajectory from the thrilling emotionally-laden launch of Theranos, which promised a breakthrough in medical technology, to its ignominious destruction as a fraudulent scam. In her I see myself - not in her level of talent or her self-confidence but in her profound self-delusion. It is this self-delusion which seems the universal cost of idealism, a cost which is borne not just by the promoter of an ideal but by the rest of the world as well - in her case about a billion dollars in round figures.Idealism sells. What it primarily sells is itself - its promise, its enthusiasm, its own inherent goodness. Modern serial idealists in places like Silicon Valley are idealists about idealism. It is their idealistic energy and talent for putting together pieces in a technological/conceptual/commercial puzzle that gets them what they need: ideas, contacts, talented colleagues, reputation, and money. The code phrase of the idealist is ‘Making a Difference.’ So Holmes “wanted to truly leave her mark on the world, she would need to accomplish something that furthered the greater good, not just become rich.” But most of all their energy and enthusiasm gets them power, the power to promote their own idealistic self-image. Idealism is always couched in terms of abstract altruism, that is, improving the human condition. But no matter what the area in which a particular ideal is to be pursued - business, politics, medicine, academia - the idealist imperative, his or her sine qua non, is the acquisition and maintenance of power for themselves. Power is a logical and practical prerequisite for the realisation of any ideal. Idealists therefore want to enrol the rest of us in their ideal. This is their route to power. Their role model is not that of Albert Schweitzer or Mother Teresa and the selfless doing of good but that of Pericles and the talking of doing good, usually about what others are required to do to prove their goodness.The world of the idealist is constrained and defined by power regardless of the merits of the ideal put forth as its rationale. Power is the elephant in the room that no one talks about but that must be constantly fed. Eventually there is room for nothing else. The ideal one has started with becomes a nostalgic memory, restored to mind only at the behest of power to increase itself. This is the essential paradox 0f idealism: it will always end in tears.The more articulate and forceful idealists are in presenting their ideal, the more power they accumulate. The idealist is a visionary, a prophet who deserves power because of the strength of their vision and prophetic acumen. Holmes made it clear to her employees that she was “starting a religion.” It is faith which justifies, for the idealist as for any believer, those actions necessary to acquire power. Chief among such actions is lying. Chronic mendacity is not incidental or exceptional for the idealist. It is a necessary virtue of technique and substance. Lying is expected because all communication is negotiation, is it not? This is the common thread among idealists of diverse backgrounds, views, and personalities. Donald Trump is an entrepreneurial idealist; Benedict XVI is a religious idealist; Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are high-tech idealists; as indeed is Elizabeth Holmes. However else they differ, they share this distinctive trait: they lie instinctively and routinely, and without remorse, indeed, I suspect, without consciousness of lying at all. Although idealists have to be enthusiastic salesmen, they are not mere evangelists who tout the advantages of their ideal, while staying silent about its possible defects or adverse consequences. Idealists are true believers. Unlike typical salesmen they do not present half truths, distortions, overstatement, and tendentious arguments knowing them to be such. They believe firmly in everything they say. They are compelling, even for hard-bitten venture capitalists. The guy Holmes recruited to do the engineering was mesmerised by her take of difference-making: “Edmond, who went by Ed, felt himself drawn in by the young woman sitting across from him who was staring at him intently without blinking. The mission she was describing was admirable, he thought.”The ideal consumes idealists, including their awareness of reality. In their own minds they do not lie, they convince - themselves as much as others - in order to further the ideal. Lies are aspirational statements not false claims. Their repetition is constructive truth, an embodiment of hope, and a demonstration of that very Christian virtue of faith. So from the start of Theranos, Holmes was faking the results of her diagnostic devices through high-tech trickery - believing, much like Bernie Madoff (another idealist), that the breakthrough was at hand. She was selling nanobot snake oil to West Coast money men at the same time as Goldman Sachs (an exceptionally idealistic firm, just ask them) was pushing its sub-prime portfolios into German pension funds. Same product - efficiency - just different labels, one procedural, the other financial.In short idealism is not merely a neurosis; it is a sociopathology. Idealists don’t simply have ideals; they seek to impose them on the rest of us - at a profit. Idealism is an infection spread from mouth to ear to mouth. As both a philosophy and a practical ethic it is the secular residue of the Christian idea of faith. It may not move mountains directly but it certainly can generate the cash to develop the machines which can. And idealism justifies anything for those who have it; it makes the idealist immune from self-criticism, and indifferent to the consequences of his actions. Idealism certainly gets things done in a world which expects and respects it. But what it gets done is rarely discussed.In business the consequence is constant low-level deceit punctuated by not infrequent criminal fraud; in politics the consequence is extremism and ultimately terrorism; in religion, fundamentalism and doctrinally-justified inhumanity. Idealism, like its progenitor of faith, is something we culturally value. The central question that Bad Blood raises is not legal, or organisational; nor is it essentially about the moral code of Silicon Valley. It is about whether this legacy of what we glibly call Christian civilisation is a salvific virtue or a destructive vice.Postscript: It is also clear that idealists have no shame: https://gizmodo.com/disgraced-therano...!121!HOLY COW. I followed the Elizabeth Holmes/Theranos story slightly but this book does such a fantastic job of showing how completely banana pants this situation was. This was also great on audio, and so addictive that I started making up chores I could do just so I could keep listening.Watch me discuss this book in my July wrap up: https://youtu.be/8kaQcaNn9uw!121!How does a woman who was once lauded as the youngest self-made female billionaire find herself now broke and charged with fraud? Her face was on the cover of many financial magazines as the golden girl of Silicon Valley, the female Steve Jobs. In her black turtlenecks, she even dressed like Jobs. Elizabeth Holmes had an idea for a medical device that used breakthrough technology that could provide lab results from a simple finger prick and a minuscule drop of blood, and thereby revolutionize the health care industry. Founded in 2003, she raised millions of dollars from investors and named her company Theranos. The problem? The medical device didn’t work. It was all an elaborate scam. Still, the company managed to get Walgreens and Safeway onboard to build on-site clinics and she received multiple awards for her work. Elizabeth was a master manipulator and a dynamic force to be dealt with. She didn’t start out with a plan to scam but she would not accept the fact that her device simply didn’t work. Many people were fooled and she worked her way into rubbing elbows with people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, and Rupert Murdoch. The story is so unbelievable, it reads like fiction. How did she do it? Partly because the company had a culture of intimidation and obsessive secrecy to cover up the fact that it was all smoke and mirrors. And partly because Ms. Holmes had a massive ego. She was charismatic and brilliant but couldn't accept failure.After finishing the book, I spent some time online, still in disbelief that something like this could happen. Kudos to the author, the investigative journalist who blew the cover on this massive fraud. The bigger question? If someone like Elizabeth Holmes could pull off such an elaborate scheme, one that ultimately put patient’s lives at risk, how do we prevent it in the future?A riveting page-turner, and a must-read for everyone! Soon to be a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence.!121!“Bad Blood” details the fascinating journey of a brilliant, soulless, young entrepreneur in pursuit of riches and fame. The story has heroes and villains, twisting and turning subplots, political intrigue and -even while we know the eventual outcome- plenty of surprises. It has all the elements of a good fictional thriller, but what makes this story most shocking and intriguing -- is the fact that it really happened. The details in this book will leave you shaking in your boots when you realize the scale of Elizabeth Holmes’ deception and the impact it might have had on public health. While aware of the Theranos story playing out at the time, “Bad Blood” provides a more detailed accounting of events. This book doesn't sugar coat the bitter pill and is a triumph of investigative journalism. John Carreyrou's research and reporting for this book were outstanding! By exposing the fraud that Holmes and Theranos were, we now know that intelligent people were duped, money and resources were wasted, and lives were saved. Non-fiction is not really my cup of tea, but I find this captivating , well documented, and it’s narrated like a novel. Don’t let the blood testing science specifics in the first half drive you away --the second half more than makes up for it in drama, and it ramps up at the end. I do carry some doubt that every word written in the book is true. Most of us will never know the whole story, and even every story has two sides. But Holmes certainly didn't make it easy to see her side of the story when all the facts were laid out. I felt Carreyrou tried to give an even hand as much as possible, but the evidence is too damning to be sympathetic on the very long term deception. Transparency and accountability should be paramount in corporate governance, government, and personal relationships --and this is certainly reinforced in this book. While I find it disgusting what Holmes and Balwani did, I’m even more disappointed our society would allow such a sham to be perpetuated. No one brave enough to say “the emperor has no clothes!”Everyone wanted to believe in the story so badly, that no one did the basic due diligence on many of Theranos’ claims. We should all be grateful that there are people like Tyler Shultz and John Carreyrou out there.!121!4.5 Stars
Elizabeth told the gathered employees that she was building a religion. If there were any among them who didn’t believe, they should leave.
Wow! What a powerful story. I'm a fan of financial stories and I personally work in the tech industry so when I heard about this book I knew I had to read it. If you like shows like Shark Tank, I think you will find this story interesting.Elizabeth Holmes is 19 and an incredibly smart girl. She decides to dropout of Stanford because she has an idea for a medical device that could literally change the entire medical industry. The device is supposed to eliminate drawing blood through a large needle and instead simply prick your finger and get results faster. She becomes romantically involved with a guy 20 years her senior named Sunny who becomes a powerhouse at the company. They name the company Theranos. Elisabeth is called the next Steve Jobs. Her company goes and eventually is valued at 9 Billion dollars and she becomes the most valuable female CEO ever. Walgreens and Safeway buy into the idea and invest millions. Other famous names invest as well such as, Rupert Murdoch. This all sounds good and well right? Well what if you worked at a company and found out the entire product was a lie and didn't actually work? What if you realized that the company you are working for made a product that can potentially kill people because the company is faking results and putting innocent lives at risk? Would you quit or say something? If you quit you get harassed & sued (you have to sign an NDA) if you speak a word. If you speak up you immediately get fired and harassed. Let's just say the grass isn't always greener. One day the lies start to come out from a WSJ article when ex-Theranos employees start to speak anonymously...
But how could this woman continue to keep this lie going for over 10 years?
This story honestly blew me away. I have no idea how large companies such as Walgreens and Safeway were able to not see through the lies. Maybe Elizabeth was an amazing negotiator but if I invested hundreds of millions of dollars and the product wasn't hitting timelines I would end that ASAP. I think that the companies had FOMO (fear of missing out), at least Walgreens did. They were afraid of CVS getting the business instead, only to be duped. The author, who is also the WSJ journalist who broke this story, calls Elizabeth a sociopath. He says they are defined by: not having a conscience in regards to actions they've taken. I'm not sure I would have pegged her as that but when you think about it, she literally could have killed people if doctors actually believe this medical device worked. Luckily, the WSJ article broke before it became a real problem. But morally how can someone do that? Oh and if you look Elizabeth up online she's already starting to try to get people to invest in a new business idea she has. I guess she's moved on...This story was so interesting and I highly recommend for those who enjoy good business scandals/investment stories. It was a wild ride and I also learned a lot about blood science! This definitely lives up to the hype.!121!Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, John CarreyrouBad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup is a nonfiction book by journalist John Carreyrou, released May 21, 2018. This book is a triumph of investigative journalism. It covers the rise and fall of Theranos, the multibillion-dollar biotech startup headed by Elizabeth Holmes. In late 2015, Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, published in The Wall Street Journal on the blood-testing startup founded by Elizabeth Holmes. The articles questioned the company's claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick.Holmes and his company soon became so popular with Silicon Valley that he was nicknamed ""Steve Jobs"" in the medical field, and his picture was constantly featured on the covers of magazines such as Forbes and Fortune. Everything was fine and the value of Theranos was increasing day by day until suddenly everything collapsed.تاریخ نخستین خوانش عنوان: خون بد: رازها و دروغ‌ها در استارتاپی در سیلیکان‌ ولی؛ نویسنده: جان کریرو؛ مترجم میلاد بشیری؛ نشر دنگ، 1398؛ در 320ص؛ شابک9786226593182؛ موضوع داستانهای واقعی از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: خون بد (کینه و دشمنی): رازها و دروغ‌ها در شهرک سیلیکون ولی شروع شده؛ نویسنده: جان کریرو‏‫؛ مترجم سیدحمید پورموسوی؛ تهران، الماس دانش، 1398؛ در 288ص؛ شابک 9786001892059؛ عنوان دیگر شرکت ترانوس؛عنوان: خون کثیف: رازها و دروغ‌های استارتاپی در سیلیکون ولی؛ نویسنده جان کریرو؛ مترجم محیا حسینقلی؛ تهران، معیار علم، 1398؛ در 471ص؛ شابک 9786226247689؛ عنوان دیگر: رازها و دروغهای استارتاپی در سیلیکون ولی؛ ‬فهرست: سخن نویسنده؛ مقدمه، اول: «زندگی هدفمند»؛ دوم: «ربات مایع ریز»؛ سوم: «حسادت به اپل»؛ چهارم: «خداحافظ ایست پلی»؛ پنجم: «همسایه دوران کودکی»؛ ششم: «سانی»؛ هفتم: «دکتر جی»؛ هشتم: «مینی لب»؛ نهم: «بازی سلامتی»؛ دهم: «سرهنگ دوم شومیکر کیست؟»؛ یازدهم: «نابودی فیوش»؛ دوازدهم: «ایبن گیینز»؛ سیزدهم: «آژانس تبلیغاتی کیات / دی»؛ چهاردهم: «عرضه به بازار»؛ پانزدهم: «اسب تک شاخ»؛ شانزدهم: «نوه»؛ هفدهم: «شهرت»؛ هجدهم: «سوگند بقراط»؛ نوزدهم: «سرنخ»؛ بیستم: «کمین گاه»؛ بیست و یکم: «اسرار تجاری»؛ بیست و دوم: «لا ماتانزا»، بیست و سوم: «کنترل خسارت»؛ بیست و چهارم: «ملکه لباس ندارد»؛ سخن آخر؛ تقدیر و تشکر؛ یادداشتها؛ درباره نویسنده؛عنوان: خون نحس: پشت پرده رازها و دروغ‌های یک «استارت‌آپ‌» در «سیلیکون ولی»؛ نویسنده جان کریرو؛ مترجمها: صدرا امامی‌، ثمین امامی‌؛ ویراستار علمی: عادل طالبی؛ ویراستاران: یوسف اسدی، شهره زمانی، سجاد محمدی؛ تهران، برآیند، 1398؛ در 364ص؛ شابک9786006466552؛ چاپ دوم 1398؛ عنوان: دشمن خونی: رازها و دروغ‌های استارت‌آپ‌های سیلیکون‌ولی؛ نویسنده: جان کاری‌یرو (کریرو)؛ مترجم محمد علی‌نژاد؛ تهران: موسسه انتشاراتی دانش ماندگار عصر، ‏‫1399؛ در 382ص؛ شابک 9786008608387؛ عنوان دیگر: رازها و دروغ‌های استارت‌آپ‌های سیلیکون‌ولی؛عنوان: ‏‫خون بد‬‏‫؛ نویسنده: جان کریرو؛ مترجم: سجاد غلامی؛ تهران، سروش دانش، 1399؛ در 358ص؛ شابک 9786007099704؛شرکت «ترانوس» وعده می‌داد با استفاده از مقدار کمی خون، به‌ سرعت، تصویری کامل از وضعیت سلامتی بیمار ارائه میکند؛ «هولمز» و شرکتش خیلی زود محبوب «سیلیکون‌ولی» شدند تا جایی که به او لقب «استیو جابز» حوزۀ پزشکی دادند، و مدام عکسش روی جلد مجلاتی چون «فوربس» و «فورچون» چاپ می‌شد؛ همه‌ چیز خوب بود و ارزش «ترانوس» روز به‌ روز افزایش می‌یافت تا اینکه ناگهان همه‌ چیز فروریختنقل از متن: (تاریخچه شرکت «ترانوس» را بیان می‌کند؛. این شرکت چند میلیارد دلاری برای کلاه‌برداری تعطیل شد، و مدیرعامل آن «الیزابت هولمز»، در حال محاکمه است؛ داستان براساس صدها مصاحبه با بیش از یکصد و پنجاه نفر، شامل بیش از شصت کارمند پیشین «ترانوس» نوشته‌ شده است؛ بیشتر مردان و زنانی که در نقش راوی حضور دارند، با نام‌های حقیقی‌شان در مصاحبه‌ها شرکت کرده اند، اما برخی از آن‌ها درخواست کرده اند هویتشان را پنهان کنم، آن‌ها یا می‌ترسیدند شرکت «ترانوس» تلافی کند، و یا نگران بودند که درگیر تحقیقات کیفری وزارت دادگستری شوند، یا درخواست حفاظت از حریم شخصی‌شان را داشتند؛ به‌ منظور ارائه حقایق کامل‌تر و دقیق‌تر، موافقت کردم این افراد را با نام مستعار نام ببرم؛ با این‌ وجود هر مطلب دیگری که در مورد آن‌ها و تجربیاتشان شرح می‌دهم، درست و حقیقی است؛ همه نقل‌قول‌هایی که طبق ایمیل‌ها یا اسناد به کار برده‌ ام، دقیقاً براساس اسناد خودشان هستند؛ نقل‌قول‌هایی که در گفتگوها به اشخاص نسبت داده‌ام، از خاطرات شرکت‌ کنندگان در مصاحبه‌ها بازسازی شده‌ اند؛ بعضی از فصل‌ها مبتنی بر مدارک موجود در دادرسی‌ها، مانند شهادت‌های رسمی در دادگاه‌ها، هستند؛ در صورت وجود چنین مدارکی، آن‌ها را مفصلاً در بخش یادداشت‌ها در پایان این روایت آورده‌ام؛ تیم «کِمپ» خبرهای خوبی برای گروهش داشت؛ مدیر اجراییِ پیشین «آی‌بی‌ام»، مسئول بیوانفورماتیک در «ترانوس» بود؛ «استارتآپ ترانوس» روی سیستم آزمایش خون پیشرفته‌ ای کار می‌کرد؛ به‌ تازگی «ترانوس» اولین نمایش بزرگش را برای یک شرکت دارویی به انجام رسانده بود؛ «الیزابت هولمز»، بنیان‌گذار بیست‌ودو ساله «ترانوس»، به «سوئیس» رفته و قابلیت‌های این سیستم را به رخ مدیران «نوارتیس»، غول داروی «اروپا»، کشیده بود؛ «کِمپ ایمیلی» با این مضمون به تیم پانزده نفره‌ اش نوشت، «امروز صبح، الیزابت با من تماس گرفت، اظهار تشکر کرد و گفت، عالی بود!

Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup is a detailed account of the (perceived) rise and demise of Theranos, a blood testing startup once valued at nearly $9B. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and barely wanted to put it down. It was baffling to read about the scams, stunts and lies this company pulled, led by founder Elizabeth Holmes and her former boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. The red flags surrounding Theranos were rampant, and Carreyrou does an excellent job presenting the full scope of the situation and the company’s timeline.“Why had Holmes always been so secretive about her technology? Why had she never recruited a board member with even basic knowledge of blood science? And why hadn’t a single venture capital firm with expertise in health care put money into the company?”Holmes was a Stanford dropout who at the age of 19, started Theranos with the intent to revolutionize blood testing using just enough from a finger prick size sample. She exaggerated the company’s technological capabilities and grossly inflated its financial projections, as well as use of its device(s), regulatory approvals obtained, and partnership agreements. 
“Theranos operates under a culture of secrecy and fear.”
 The company was a revolving door for the majority of its existence - Employees were frequently fired for raising any concerns and forced to deal with Balwani, Holmes’ second in command, who, according to the book, was perceived as a tyrant by many. There are plenty of supporting examples for this description of Balwani too. Numerous employees also resigned, unwilling to engage in deceptive, unethical practices and/or impatient with Holmes’ lack of direction, lies, and sharp corner-cutting. In addition to establishing the secretive culture and work environment of Theranos, there is a fair amount of information in Bad Blood regarding the science and technology attempted by the company, as well as its involvement in legal proceedings. Both topics are easily digestible and not written with overly technical language. I am dumbfounded that so many investors just went along with the pitch and that more of them didn’t challenge the constantly ambiguous information being provided. Due diligence is real! It makes you wonder how some people got to where they are. Bad Blood mentions several times that Holmes has a deep voice, often taking many people by surprise. Finally, after reading about it for the 7th time, I Googled a video of her to hear it for myself and I too was taken by surprise - It was not a voice I was expecting! Some former employees noted they suspected it was a front Holmes put on, to be treated equally and gain the same level of respect as men in the male-dominate culture of SV. Maybe, though this seems exhausting - I know I’d be tired from changing my voice that drastically ever time I spoke at work. Holmes had an unabashed fascination with Steve Jobs. It is clear she liked the idea of being perceived as an innovative genius, though she is far from one herself. She wasn’t truly willing to do the hard work with a genuine “whatever it takes” attitude to get there. Hence the drastic cutting of corners, faulty devices, and unreliable work product of Theranos. She just wanted the fame and fortune, and inflated her sense of worth along the way, hiring excessive security detail and taking up most invitations to speak at industry events. After I finished the book, I found myself reading more about the company and Holmes online, still in disbelief that this BS actually went on for so many years. The following quote from an October 2018 MarketWatch article notes: “After Holmes burned through executives, cash, investor goodwill and regulatory patience, nothing of value was left but the company’s patents.”Though Holmes settled her “massive fraud” charges with the SEC in early 2018, I am extremely curious to see how the remaining various lawsuits will pan out. Part of me suspects wealth and privilege will play a role in saving the day for Holmes, but given the critical nature of Theranos’ deceit (human health), I am hopeful this will not be the case. At some point, we need to bring down the hammer and demand enough is enough - False test results impacting doctors’ treatment plans and patients’ medical decisions seem like a great opportunity to do so.!121!Mesmerising. Unbelievable. Compulsively readable. I cannot recommend this highly enough. I sped through this audiobook in a few days because I just could not stop listening to it. There were so many unbelievable things in this true account of the Theranos scam that my mouth dropped open in a way I wouldn't have thought happens in real life.John Carreyrou traces the story of Elizabeth Holmes and her medical start-up Theranos from the beginning with the help of countless interviews and other insights. The picture he paints is breathtaking: of a firm run like a cult, of incompetence that can only be explained by a complete lack of understanding of science by nearly everyone involved, of unethical hounding of those who did see the bad science for what it was. I can tell you, if I can see the science as flawed it is really flawed – my knowledge of biology and chemistry is lacklustre to say the least.While I overall enjoyed this book a whole lot, there were a few things that did not quite work for me. First and foremost the framing of the story – as Elizabeth Holmes did not give any interviews for this book, her story is told from the other end, which I am absolutely fine with and I do think Carreyrou did an exceptional job with this, but his clear distaste for Holmes shines through in a way that I did not always appreciate. For example, early on he uses an anecdote of her playing Monopoly with her brothers and being a super sore loser as an indication for how horrible and competitive a person she is – and I don’t buy that. Lots of kids are sore losers, most of them grow up not scamming patients. I do agree with his assessment that Holmes scammed her investors purposefully and did not care about the patients being misdiagnosed because of her flawed technology but I wish he had let me come to this assessment on my own a bit more.As a case study of how the lack of diverse knowledge can harm a company, this book is priceless. There were many instances where having somebody on the board of directors with just a little bit of knowledge of the science between the big idea would have led to a totally different ending. I would have liked to have seen an analysis of the social structures in place that enabled Holmes to build her company and run it for many years without any pertinent experience as a 19-year-old college dropout just based on knowing the right people and acting the part. But still, this book is amazing in achieving what it set out to do.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog.!121!I don’t read a lot of nonfiction books. I love the imagination of fiction. When I heard about this book from a television show, it sounded unbelievable. The fact that this was a true story that seemed stranger than fiction, I had to give it a read. I’m really glad I did because this was really good. This story is about the youngest woman, to become a self-made billionaire, and the giant fraud she committed on Silicon Valley. Elizabeth Holmes, was a Stanford drop-out that used her knowledge and family connections to build a billion dollar start-up name Theranos. Theranos invented a blood testing portable machine that could test all the different blood tests a major lab would with just a drop of blood. This was a major breakthrough as it could stop the need for needles and vials of blood sick patients have to constantly be subjected to. Not only that but these machines were to be rolled out in Safeway (a supermarket) and Walgreens (a drug store) all over the USA so everyone could afford to be tested. The problem with this great idea; the machines never actually worked! This truly is one of the biggest scams Silicon Valley had ever seen. The cheating and lies and manipulation are unbelievable. The amount of people Elizabeth managed to bewitch is staggering. These were smart people she swindled. If you live in the USA, you will be shocked by many of the big names that totally fell for the scam. Actually, the names are so big you will probably recognize them even living outside the USA. At one point Elizabeth was worth close to 5 billion dollars. This book is written by the Wall Street Journalist that fought to bring her lies to light. This book is also about the brave men and women who were ex and current employees that risked lawsuits and bullying to blow the whistle. If you have heard about this book and were considering reading it I absolutely recommend it. This is not my normal fiction I love to read, instead it’s the unbelievable truth.!121!A Sanford dropout with no extensive engineering or medical or science or business knowledge 'created' an idea for a product and company that required all of those things. It not only ultimately failed but also put untold numbers of people at risk and harm? You don't say. One thing, for me, that was truly surprising in this story is that the dropout in question wasn't a white male, instead it was a woman, Elizabeth Holmes. Elizabeth Holmes had on the surface a brilliant idea - what if just a couple drops of blood could be used to test multiple health indicators/diseases/chemical levels instead of the large and painful blood draws typically used? Unfortunately this idea was not built on any knowledge of how different types of blood tests work, the limits of accuracy when diluting blood, the difficulties in preventing minute amounts of blood from drying out, and the medicals risks incurred when blood tests cannot be held to the same level of accuracy as normal larger blood draws. So basically her idea was more magical thinking without any actual plan on how to implement it, but that didn't give her pause never mind stop her.This story of how corporate greed and ignorance went unchecked for so long kept me up way past my bedtime. I was completely engrossed, shocked, and dismayed by how this fraud was perpetrated. Even the pharmacy company Walgreen's, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and now ex-Secretary of Defense General Mattis were ultimately involved!!121!When we get our blood tested, we naturally assume the results that come back are trustworthy. High LDL cholesterol levels? We're either going to change our diet (whole food plant based is the way to go!), start exercising more, or decide to take statins (tip: WFPB diet and exercise are much better for your overall health than statins). Same thing if our blood work comes back saying we're diabetic. Or any other number of disorders. One thing is certain, when our blood work comes back saying there's something wrong, most of us are going to do something to remedy the problem. We take the results at their word, not second guess them and decide to do nothing. Imagine getting blood work back saying you have cancer. You're going to have a whole lot of stress and worry, hope you have decent health insurance to cover the expensive tests you now need to have before you can start treatment, lose money taking time off work to get tests done, etc. We don't usually question the results of blood work; instead we rely on them to diagnose medical issues or to assure us that we are healthy. Doctors also rely on them, basing 70 percent of their treatment decisions on lab results.Unfortunately, Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos didn't care about the reliability of blood tests. In the early 2000s, she started a company that would, she promised, revolutionize the medical industry. She guaranteed a medical device that patients could have in their own homes which performed hundreds of different blood tests, safely and quickly, and with only a tiny drop of blood. Sounds awesome, doesn't it? No more waiting at least a couple days for results. No more feeling and seeing long needles plunge into your veins, watching (or not watching, in my case!) your blood pour from your body into small tubes. Ick! I get grossed out just thinking about it!  Moving along..... the idea Elizabeth Holmes had was brilliant.... and yet it was just that, an idea. She raised billions of dollars assuring investors that she had a machine that worked and accurately tested blood, quickly and safely. She sold machines to the Mexican government to test for Swine flu (even though she was told you could more accurately test for it through a nasal swab). She signed deals with Walgreens and Safeway and the US military. She became the youngest person to win the Horatio Alger Award. President Obama made her a U.S. ambassador for global entrepreneurship.There was one problem though: the machines didn't actually work. This didn't bother Elizabeth Holmes; she consistently ignored faulty tests and wouldn't listen to her employees when they suggested something was wrong with the technology. She showed not an ounce of regard for patients' well-being; the only thing she seemed to care about was money and fame. She likened herself to Steve Jobs, even going so far as to dress like him, name parts of her lab like he did, and lower her voice several notches to speak more like him. Unfortunately for patients, Ms. Holmes' technology rarely worked, but that didn't stop her from raising billions of dollars and hoodwinking investors and company CEOs alike. I am amazed at how she was able to manipulate people and how these (usually) men took her word that her machines worked, this equipment that could cause suffering and even death to patients if it didn't work. No matter how evasive and dishonest she was, many people couldn't see past her blonde hair and red lips. Thankfully it eventually came out that her technology was not reliable, before it became responsible for the death of anyone. As the author notes, there are ""two nightmare scenarios false blood-test results could lead to. A false positive might cause a patient to have an unnecessary medical procedure. But a false negative was worse: a patient with a serious condition that went undiagnosed could die"". As of the writing of this review, Elizabeth Holmes is awaiting trial on fraud charges, along with her former boyfriend and the company COO “Sunny” Balwani.This book is meticulously researched. For me, there was a bit too much detail (I don't care what kind of cars the people in the book drove or where they went to eat) and I think I would have preferred a lengthy magazine article about the story to such a detailed book. I don't care what individual emails said (unless they revealed something new) or who said what about whom. At times, this felt like a gossipy tabloid and at others it was overwhelming with the details. However, it is well-written and well researched and so, whilst it's 3 stars for how much I personally liked it, I think it deserves 4 stars. Unfortunately, I am already cynical and have a difficult time trusting doctors (who often seem to care more about the profits of pharmaceutical companies than about the well-being of their patients) and the for-profit medical system in this country. I think my level of distrust has risen by what I learned in this book. Still, it's always better to be informed.!121!From an early age Elizabeth Holmes, wanted to become an entrepreneur, maker her own fortune. Going to Standford, she revered Steve Jobs, and wanted to succeed in a life changing invention of her own. She dropped out of Standford and started her own company. She would Implement, invent and sell a small machine that would only take a pin prick of blood, getting instantaneous results that would allow doctors to make medication changes, much more quickly. Sounds good, many thought so, she raised millions, contracts from leading companies. Many including Joe Biden and Betsy de Boss, contributed money to this promising silicon valley startup. She hired top people in different fields, but soon her company became revolving door as the littlest thing to get someone fired.So what went wrong? How was she able to pull the wool over do many eyes. Smart people, CEOs of leading companies, and the public at large? That is the story Carreyrou uncovered and made public. This journalist from The Wall Street Journal exposes Elizabeth and her company Theranos.This is an engrossing read and another that proves the adage that truth is do often stranger than fiction.!121!Money isn't the root of all evil. GREED is.....
A Fascinating story, a tale of corporate fraud and a Journalist who uncovers the biggest corporate fraud since Enron. An intriguing story about a college dropout by the name of Elizabeth Holmes who becomes by the age of twenty nine, CEO of a company called Theranos and Silicon Valley’s first ever female billionaire entrepreneur but by 2018 was facing federal charges of massive fraud which could see her facing up to 20 years in prison. I knew nothing about Elizabeth Homes or Theranos but this was an interesting and detailed account about of her amazing rise to fame and her demise and how one reporter uncovered a massive fraud. I think what shocked me most about this book was the gullibility of people in power and how the wealthiest are held in such high esteem that a fraud of this nature could go unnoticed for so long. There are a lot of employees names, medical and legal jargon to get through in this story and it was by times quite repetitive but I do understand it was necessary to the story, however I felt it dragged the story down and hence my 3 star rating. Having said that what an eye opener of a story that has to be read to be believed. There are photos included in the book but I did a little googling after I had finished as I just had to hear “ the voice of Elizabeth Holmes”!121!Well, friends, by now I’ve read this here book, I’ve listened to The Dropout podcast, and I’ve watched that crazy ole HBO documentary where Elizabeth Holmes stared at me with those creepy, unblinking eyes in front of a white background. I think I’ve covered the story from every angle, consumed it in three different ways, and now I’m wondering how I missed this story when it was a thing. Before all the books and documentaries and stuff. Oh well. It’s always good to read a book directly from the source/ in this case WSJ’s own John Carreyou. He’s the guy who busted this thing open, and when he gets to that point in his little book here you can almost picture him all giddy at his computer, furiously typing away with his fingers just bouncing off the keys and his legs shaking under the table, a big grin on his face, standing up to clap and throw his hand into the air with a loud Ric Flair “Woo!” as he wraps up the chapter. But it’s the details he pulls out along the way that make this book so captivating. He unravels things slowly, introducing us to the vast amount of characters and the Theranos headquarters, making us feel like we’re an employee working in a fake lab. But it’s the story the book is telling that is so unbelievable, as if this must actually be a fiction book because this couldn’t actually happen, right? Somewhere along he way this guy must be embellishing or maybe this is just based on true events and not a true event itself. There’s no way this could have actually been pulled off. It’s a cautionary tale of what money and power can do. I still don’t know if Holmes started with good intentions of changing the healthcare industry and saving lives only to get in way too deep, or was her goal always to just lie and cheat her way into fame and fortune? And why the scary low voice? There are so many intriguing things surrounding this story. It’s now spawned a movie and a Hulu series so we are nowhere close to done with this. There’s also a real life trial coming with real life consequences. This is the only the beginning, and now I’m fully invested to find out where this all ends.!121!Elizabeth Holmes convicted today: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/te...A ""bloody"" gripping true crime, reads like a thrillerA story on how everyone wants to believe a conman, or in the Theranos case, Elizabeth Holmes. She is a Stanford dropout with a mix of youth, charisma, vision and ruthless sueing and suppressing people who do not agree with her.Meteoric rise against the oddsIt’s really amazing how so many people had negative experiences with either Elizabeth as CEO and Sunny Balwani, her lover and COO, and how Theranos could still just march onwards for such a long time. Basic checks are bulshitted out of or overridden because everyone wants to believe in the vision of Elizabeth or is awed/afraid of her C level connections and expensive lawyers. A board with almost no knowledge in the medical field, not critical to their young dropout CEO, who they think will be the next Steve Jobs and a fear of missing out by established parties like Walgreens, helps even more in keeping things covered up. Fear also ruled internally at Theranos, with secrecy between departments and very high employee turnover masking people having troubles with their conscious. Loyalty and long hours were key and anyone critical would be put on a side track or fired on the spot and got warnings from lawyers. Holmes is evangelical in the importance and transformative quality of her products, calling a Theranos miniLab “the lost important thing humanity produced” during a Christmas party and actually referring to Theranos as a religion in an office meeting.Playing with lives and the fall of the companyHowever Theranos was really playing with lives, much more so than for instance Tesla, an other company that came to my mind when reading this book, also strong in being cool, having a vision and making claims that are sometimes more future oriented than based in reality. Clinical tests were done (poorly, by unqualified staff) without any disregard to the people relying on the results. People being diagnosed with cancer or diabetes, and worse, people who think there is nothing wrong with them even though they do have a disease. Some people were rushed to the intensive care and paid $3.000 in hospital bills because of false positives; others were pregnant and could have lost their baby when they’d adjusted their medication based on the outcomes of the Theranos tests. The soaring popularity of Elizabeth, who became a paper billionaire when a funding round valued Theranos at $ 9 billion puts the faulty quality of the products to scrutiny. Despite top lawyers working for Theranos more and more people contact Carreyrou and in the end the authorities ban Holmes from running a company for 10 years and the trials for fraud will start in 2020. Bad Blood is a chilling read of ambition trying to defy reality, without any due care to people and read like a thriller: I enjoyed it a lot!!121!What an audacious fraud! Elizabeth Holmes must be the Queen of self-hype to get so many powerful (and allegedly smart) men to support this scheme (Jim Mattis! Henry Kissinger!). I would enjoy seeing both her and Sunny Balwani in jail, for what they'd done not only to their customers, but their employees.Although I am not a fan of Wall Street Journal and the baloney they peddle in their opinion pieces, I was impressed by how their investigative department stood up against legal pressures from Theranos. Real journalism is great!!121!I loved (and was disturbed by) every second of this. It's the exact kind of investigative story that I find fascinating filled with strange figures, secrecy, and moments that will make you say ""how is that possible?!"" Not only an incredible story, but Carreyrou does an absolutely wonderful job in telling it. Though some of the science is fairly complex, he's able to explain it clearly enough to show you just how critical Theranos' missteps were and the impact it had on real people's lives. I powered through because I just had to know how it all would play out; and even though I knew the general outcome in the end from the news, that didn't take away from the power of the story.Stories like this really make you question important things like, do you ever really know a person? How can we be so blinded by what's right in front of us? What is our duty when it comes to protecting ourselves versus protecting others? And how do we allow our desires and fantasies to keep us from seeing reality? Incredibly thought-provoking, well told, and simultaneously infuriating, this all makes for a great read.!121!3 ""important and brave work but underwhelming telling"" stars !!!Third Most Disappointing Read of 2020 Award There are so many reviews of this that I am going to keep this very short-courageous and admirable work in unearthing a huge medical scam that could have put thousands of patients at risk-a good sequenced telling of events as they unravelled at Theranos labs-very little on the developmental histories of Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani that may have deepened understanding of what occured-little analysis of why this occurred from bureaucratic, economic, political and sociological perspectives-overall somewhat underwhelmed by the writing and presentation of very carefully researched factsVery glad I read this but I really wanted and yes expected so much more ! Here is a little clip of an office party and her dancing there :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrT0j...!121!Just when I thought all reporters ever did anymore was see what was trending on social media and write stories with titles like ""You'll cheer how this mom clapped-back at her body-shamers on Twitter,"" this book gives me hope that old-fashioned investigative journalism is alive and well and doing exactly what it's supposed to: shine an unflinching hot light on those who abuse their power and privilege. Here, it's aimed at the bizarre cult of Elizabeth Holmes and her ""disruptive"" ""game changing"" company, Theranos.Silicon Valley is the epitome of mediocrity dressed-up as brilliance. Having wasted several years of my career working for two different Valley-based ""start-ups"" (one now on its 18th year of ""staring up""), I saw a lot of familiar patterns in this thorough, well-organized and well-told story of how a teenaged college drop-out with all the right connections managed to bamboozle people who we would otherwise assume should know better. There was the usual unprofessional office behavior, the disorganization, the endless cheerleading bordering on religious hysteria about how ""we're changing humanity!"" all wrapped with the constant disregard for convention and ethics and the truth. In this case, there were a few new wrinkles: complete contempt for the law, and a willingness to bully people to the bitter end to protect their lies.Although free of literary license and told straight-ahead as a journalistic piece, this book still reads a bit like a thriller. This could easily be adapted to a psychological horror movie, where young impressionable minds sold on the lie that Silicon Valley is full of the world's smartest people operating on a higher plane of existence go to work for a ""disruptive"" start-up, only to slowly have their perception of reality warped by the bullies running the place until they doubt themselves and everything they knew. At the top we have the calm, collected evil genius of Elizabeth Holmes, dressed the part all in black, speaking in hypnotic, reality-distorting tones, staring unblinking at you with massive blue eyes; to her right is her henchman and lover, a mysterious and wealthy older man named Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who dishes out abuse, punishments, diatribes, and hatchet jobs with complete impunity, to the point you can hear the evil music swell every time his name is mentioned. In the Hollywood version of this story, he would get his comeuppance by being tossed from a cliff, to an eruption of cheers in the theater. (In real life we have to settle for an ongoing criminal investigation.) Backing them up are the tentacles of a powerful law firm; the mere mention of their name sends shivers down people's spines and causes them to give up before they even start. They deploy a nationwide network of spies who know your every move, and who almost literally leap out of the shadows (or in one case, down the stairs) to serve you with papers and bully you into signing away your life.The duping of so many otherwise smart people is like a real-life retelling of 
Being There
, where everyone believes that Holmes is a genius for no other reason than everyone else believes she is a genius. There is a passage of a recalled conversation with brand-name people attributing high qualities to her that she herself probably didn’t even say. Once again “too good to be true” took a back seat to “wanting to believe,” reminding us of how Bernie Madoff managed to scam a different group of supposedly smart people. Apparently no one is immune to magical thinking.The author did an amazing job exposing this entire sham and documenting it in a way that gives a complete and chronological picture of what is likely just an extreme example of business-as-usual in Silicon Valley. The difference here is the scope and gravitas, since instead of a forgettable and unimportant software company, Theranos was a healthcare provider, operating in a heavily regulated industry, producing flawed results that directly affected patients' lives. (One person, for example, was out over $3,000 in unnecessary medical tests due to an erroneous blood diagnosis from Theranos. At least no one died, though another person is suing for a heart attack he said could have been prevented if their test had been accurate.) It was also an extreme example of paranoia and litigious bullying, using investor money to buy the finest in legal muscle to intimidate anyone and everyone: former employees, former board members, the journalist who broke the story (this book's author), the  Wall Street Journal itself—even the doctors and patients who complained about faulty test results received a personal visit from Sunny, where he threatened to ruin their careers if they didn’t sign away their right to complain. It was one step below a global drug cartel.So even if you never heard of Theranos before this scandal (like me), or are sick of seeing Elizabeth Holmes’ turtlenecked head all over the internet (also like me), this book is definitely worth reading, even if just for the schadenfreude it inspires. And hopefully it will burst people’s notion that the Silicon Valley’s “disruption” is somehow wonderful. Far from being a bastion of the future, the Valley is firmly stuck in the past of its gold-rush days, and this book shows just how far some of those opportunists will go to protect their gains, even if at the expense of employees, investors, patients, doctors, regulators, and any one else they perceive as a threat. Perhaps next time, people will actually do their due diligence.Most of all, I'm just thankful that real investigative journalism is alive and well and keeping us safe and free. Buy this book if for no other reason than that.!121!20/11/22 - Update: Elizabeth Holmes sentences to more than 11 years (135 months) in jail, for what prosecutors called one of the “most substantial” white collar crimes ever seen in the US. In a separate trial, Holmes’s former boyfriend and Theranos chief operating officer Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani was found guilty for his part, convicted on 12 counts of fraud. He is due to be sentenced in early December.——————————————————————-28/1/22 - Update: Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty Jan. 3 on four counts of criminal fraud against investors. She was acquitted on four counts tied to patients. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the remaining three counts tied to investors. Holmes’ sentencing is set for later in 2022 (possibly September) to allow for the trial of Sunny Balwani, her former personal and professional partner, whose trial for related fraud charges will begin in March.——————————————————————-10/9/21 - I'm interested to learn that the trial of Elizabeth Holmes has now commenced, in California. I'll be watching closely for updates on proceedings.-------------------------------------------29/1/21 - I’ve been on a bit of a roll with books telling the story of successful American companies, of late: Tesla and SpaceX, Google and Yahoo all had inspiring leaders who’s drive and focus meant that they developed innovative products and services that caught the public’s imagination. So what about a company called Theranos? No, I hadn’t heard of that one. This account of the formation and ultimately the failure of a Silicon Valley startup company who produced what they claimed to be an innovative way of drawing and testing blood samples was written by an investigative journalist, John Carreyrou, whilst working for the Wall Street Journal. Having been contacted by a whistle-blower he wrote series of articles questioning claims made by the company’s founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes. In this book, Carreyrou takes us back to the forming of Theranos and explains in some detail how the company was formed, the idea that Holmes propagated and how the company drew in investment from a string of venture capitalists (raising over $70 million) and struck huge deals for the roll-out of their product with Safeway and Walgreens.The company was obsesses with secrecy and when Holmes brought in Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani as Chief Operating Officer he became the de facto enforcer, ruthlessly stamping down on anything and anybody he thought might be compromising the strict rules the company had laid down. Brutal sackings were the norm and a posse of colleagues were frog-marched from the company's headquarters, often for most minor of transgressions. Unknown to the other board members, Holmes and Balwami were in a romantic relationship and due to the way voting rights were structured the pair were able to maintain rigid control over all of the company’s activity’s.At its peak, the company attracted a valuation of $9 billion and Holmes had cemented close relationships with a number of very high profile figures, including Henry Kissinger, George Schultz and James Mattis. She had also become a presidential role model for American entrepreneurs and had hosted a visit from vice-president Joe Biden. But it all came tumbling down as Carryrou persuaded a number of ex-employees to disclose the tricks and lies that had managed to hoodwink not only investors and customers but also the regulators. In essence, the the product did not work as advertised and more importantly it provided dangerously erroneous readings for many customers. Theranos ceased operation in 2018 and both Holmes and Bulwani have since been charged with fraud, with a trial likely to take place in 2021.It’s an amazing story, but I wasn’t quite so taken by the manner in which it is told. There’s a lot of detail here, much of it of a medical nature, and without the requisite background knowledge I found chunks of it somewhat hard to follow. Then there’s the way this audio version was read, by Will Damron – to me, the pace felt too slow and the tone sometimes over dramatic. But overall I did find it a fascinating account of so how many seemingly savvy people can get taken in and put money and/or their personal reputation on the line without having undertaken due diligence.","['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'True Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Science', 'Crime', 'Biography']"
Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis (Hardcover),J.D. Vance,3.87,410182,2016,"Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love,” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.","I read this book as an advance galley, long before it became a Thing and I did not read this book because I wanted Vance to explain Trump, though he's somehow been chosen by liberal media as the person to do just that (though the handful of interviews I saw seemed more like Chris Matthews wanted to pat himself on the back for having a guest with hillbilly cred than actually listening to what Vance had to say). I didn't think this book would have mass appeal because no one outside of Appalachia seems to give a shit about Appalachia, and its success has surprised me. It's not a perfect book, but I do think it's an okay starting point as long as you remember that this is just one guy's perspective on his own experiences. I picked this up because Vance is from the same part of the world as me and I wanted to read about something that I could relate to. That cover photo looks like it could have been taken on the road that I grew up on, in one of the poorest places in Ohio where Appalachia and the Midwest intersect. It was so poor that a girl who made me cry in first grade was featured on a CBS news story on American Poverty. I always knew it was different from the cities and suburbia reflected in pop culture, but moving away and realizing just how different it is from other places was still a weird experience for me. It’s so rural that I struggle to describe it adequately to the people I’ve met since living in Philadelphia and the DC Metro area. It matches stereotypes to some extent, but the stereotypes also often miss the mark. People not from Appalachia really don’t get it, and they’re often way too quick to dismiss it. I never really fit in in Appalachia, for so many different reasons, but I’ll also fiercely defend it. Put me in a room of East-Coast natives making jokes about “uneducated rednecks” and I will probably grow a second head. Poor rural white people are the last group that you can make fun of without being considered un-PC, and I think that’s a huge problem that creates a lot of divisiveness. Books like this one show a culture that is underrepresented.Vance grew up in a small town between Cincinnati and Dayton. His family experienced many of the same migration patterns, cultural touchstones, and poverty-related struggles that describe the lives of my extended family and the families of my high-school peers. His father was never a consistent presence in his life, his mother struggled with drug addiction. His grandparents were the greatest source of normalcy in his life, but they taught him to live by a hillbilly code of loyalty and self-sufficiency. Though they encouraged him to take his education seriously, wanted a better life for him than they’d had, he didn’t do well in school and didn’t seems to think he’d ever have a future outside of Appalachia. But then he joined the Marines and it turned his life around. With a new sense of self-determination, a broader perspective of the larger world, and developed leadership skills, Vance enrolled at Ohio State University and, eventually, went on to Yale Law School—an unheard of achievement for someone from his family, his hometown, and his struggling public high school. A lot of the experiences he had in New Haven frustrated him, and that was definitely something I could relate to. However, I think those experiences caused Vance to dig into his conservative values in a way that I can not relate to. There's been some sociocultural analysis of Appalachia, but I don't think anything's ever focused so specifically on Appalachia Ohio. I'm also unaware of any exploration of the region that's actually been done by a native and therefore possesses an insider understanding of what makes the people tick. There really are a lot of very specific personality traits that are unique to the people who settled in the Ohio River Valley, and these traits make no sense to outsiders. When people talk about how ridiculous it is that West Virginia tends to vote Republican even though it seems to be against their interests, they are fundamentally misunderstanding a lot of these traits that are so ingrained in the psychology of the state and that frustrates me to no end. Vance focuses primarily on his own personal story. He does cite some research about the region in general—but this is mostly for context and is not meant to be exhaustive. I think it’s important to remember that Vance is conservative, though he doesn’t seem to be as far right-wing as the Tea Party, so his ideas may not appeal to the point of view of many liberals coming to this book trying to make sense of Trump. By giving this book three stars, that’s not to say I necessarily agree with his political point of view but I think it’s important to hear different voices and his I'd certainly one that I recognize from my time in Southeastern Ohio.Vance makes an attempt to extrapolate from his own experience to explain why social welfare is not enough to help address the problems of Appalachia. The short answer is: there are no easy solutions, because so many of the problems are circular. People don't succeed because they don't see anything to be hopeful about, and they don't see any room for hope because so few have succeeded. Without hope, no one bothers to take baby steps towards the kind of changes that can move the region into a better economic reality. I think some people see that as blaming the poor for being poor but I do think there are some things that need to be changed from inside the house (I just think those things are different than Vance). I do wish I'd come away from this book feeling a little more optimistic, that it offered up some more concrete solutions, but I suppose that wasn't really Vance's stated purpose. And it's not really something that falls squarely on his shoulders. He's still young—just 31, he likely only finished Yale two years before this book was written, if I've done the math correctly. Regardless, I do think it's important to listen to the voices of Appalachia. Change is never going to happen until we all start listening to each other and not just applying our own prejudices to each other's words.!121!Very candid account of growing up disadvantaged and white. The parallels between his demographic and a historically, systematically marginalized Black America are evident. Both populations deserve understanding and empathy, but I tend to think the author thinks his people are somehow more noble. I would have like to seen an acknowledgment that the two groups should not be antagonistic but work together to achieve mutually beneficial economic goals.!121!I'll be honest I didn't totally finish the book before giving up. I hear Vance on NPR and the story caught my attention. Yet, what I thought would be a better analysis of American economics and poverty proved to be very different. It's one of those conservative love stories of "" I got my shit together so everyone can"". While I respect the struggle Vance had, I also believe it's a very naive picture of what is going on. It explains why people FEEL a way. It does not explain the systemic issues that are also at play. Skip it if you want anything profound.!121!2016 is the year of Donald Trump, and J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy should be at the top of every politico and thought leader's reading list living in the Acela corridor. Vance is both an excellent writer and a thoughtful person—and when combined with a compelling story, he's able to shed some light on the lives of those living on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains.Let's start with what this book isn't. It's not an explanation of why Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, or at least not directly. Nor is it a guide for how to alleviate Appalachian poverty. Vance is too smart to offer simplistic explanations or solutions. Rather, it is one man's experience living in the culture of Appalachia and placing his experience in the broader context of American society. It is the fact that he doesn't try to do too much that makes this book as compelling as it is.Vance grew up in southeastern Ohio and eastern Kentucky, largely raised by his grandmother (Mamaw) and having a complicated relationship with his family members. Hillbilly Elegy is a story that demonstrates the full measure of the brokenness that wracks Appalachia, but it is also a story that exemplifies the depths of familial love and opportunity.Vance's description of Yale Law School is interesting, because while he portrays it as an institution in which he feels out of place (very few people from poor backgrounds go to Yale Law School), he also was afforded the opportunity to go there. That tension—the fact that he managed to ""beat the odds"" while still acknowledging the deep cultural divide between elite institutions and wide swaths of middle America (the region of the United States sometimes derisively referred to as ""flyover country"")—pervades the book and ultimately makes it such an important book.For that tension exists not merely in the people like Vance who have a foot in both worlds—one in southeastern Ohio with his hillbilly family and the other in downtown San Francisco working for an investment fund. It also exists in the United States writ large, as college-educated urbanites express confusion at the values of those outside of their spheres. There are, therefore, two Americas—one divided less by race or geography (though those certainly matter), but by class and values. In order to break down those barriers, we need books like Hillbilly Elegy and people like Vance to help us build bridges across those cultural barriers we have today.!121!HILLBILLY ELEGIST: YOUR BOOK SMELLS BAD ENOUGH TO KNOCKA BUZZARD OFF A SHIT WAGONMa lives in the hollerway back yander thar.she plays the fiddle and singsjust like Emmy Lou.Mamaw chews tobaccoand spits the wad right in her old Styrofoam cup.even in front of company.my pa was a coal minerand beats us younguns cus he meaner than a polecatand a little touchedwhen he is drunker than Cootey Brown.We refused welfare don't believe in eatinghigh on the hog,so I picked my poor self upand so can y'all. just go out and git a job cus it is y'alls falt if y'all ain't a workin'And if you read this farI got your attentionso I want to say that this here writer feller plumb needs some more book larnin,and a whole lotta more empathy.He makes me fit to be tied;I am madder than a wet hornet.cus getting anywhere in lifetakes luck and opportunity.and that means it has tocome up and bite you in the butt. it isn't always their faultif they are down and out,but now you have writtena book for republicansto use against your kinfolk.written by Jessica Slade, 2017!121!Have you ever wondered what became of the Scotch-Irish, who dug America’s coal, forged America’s steel and built America’s automobiles, who worked for the American Dream Monday through Friday. prayed to The Good Lord on Sunday, and revered F.D.R. and J.F.K. every day of the week? The last thing I heard, they elected Donald Trump. And I am still looking for explanations.If you want somebody who knows Appalachian culture from inside to explain it all to you, I highly recommend  Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance. Vance has his roots in Eastern Kentucky, a troubled childhood in the rustbelt city of Middletown, Ohio, and yet has succeeded in graduating from Ohio State and matriculating from The Yale Law School. He tells us about his family of “crazy hillbillies,” and, in the process of telling us the story of his family, he tells us the story of America too.The hillbilly seeking the American Dream in industrial Ohio was always “a stranger in a strange land”, for he cleaved to his Appalachian identity—the church in the wildwood, the old folks in the hollers—and returned to the welcoming hills every chance he could get. But economic decline left its mark on both mountain culture and urban manufacturing. Opportunities shrunk, hard liquor was supplemented by painkillers and heroin, church attendance fell and so did belief in the American Dream.J.D.’s were most powerful influences were his grandparents Mamaw and Papaw: fierce, hard-drinking battlers with a proud belief in individual honor and family solidarity. They might beat their kids, sure, only when they deserved it...but no outsider better say one harsh word to them, much less lay a finger on them. They probably did their own children little good—especially J.D.’s mother, addicted to heroin and a bewildering succession of men—but by the time J.D. needed them they had mellowed a little, and gave him the love and determination he needed to succeed.The early chapters about family are compelling, but the last few chapters, touching on the cultural hurdles a hillbilly in a high class East Coast law school must overcome, are fascinating too. J.D. shows us how many things the upper middle class takes for granted—how to dress for an interview, how to schmooze a prospective employer, how to strive for what you really want not what you’re supposed to want—are difficult for a young man from a poor background.J.D. Vance’s insights are noteworthy not only because of his family background but also because of his political philosophy. He is a conservative, one of those cautious, reflective conservatives who are growing increasingly rare these days. (Former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels is one of his heroes, David Frum is a former employer and mentor). He is critical of specific government practices (the high barriers grandparent’s face if they wish to be foster parents, for example), but he also realizes that government has a role—although limited—in raising the Appalachian people from poverty. The major responsibility, however, he puts squarely on the shoulders on the hillbilly himself:
There is a cultural movement in the white working class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains adherents by the day.Here is where the rhetoric of modern conservatives (and I say this as one of them) fails to meet the real challenges of their biggest constituents. Instead of encouraging engagement, conservatives increasingly foment the kind of detachment that has sapped the ambition of so many of my peers...What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are the expectations that they had for their own lives. Yet the message of the right is increasingly: It’s not your fault that you’re a loser; it’s the government’s fault.!121!Update, 02/06/23A Tale of Moral Degeneration:...People talk about hard work all the time in places like Middletown. You can walk through a town where 30 percent of the young men work fewer than twenty hours a week and find not a single person aware of his own laziness.Why is this guy the darling of the talk show circuit right now? He thinks his fellow hillbillies just need to work harder. Problem solved! He thinks because he made it everyone else should be able to do the same. He asserts social programs won't help his lazy people but then is short on solutions. ...There is a cultural movement in the white working class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains adherents by the day.True- so when he is asked in interviews and by the media about Trump's appeal he needs to be more honest. He indicates that it is because Trump is a political outsider & not part of the political elite, speaks to their issues, & sounds like one of them. He doesn't talk about the racism & xenophobia that is much a part of his people. That is also part of Trump's appeal & needs to be included in his narrative.!121!This books had so much more depth than I expected and honestly, I am more than a little overwhelmed.
What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are the expectations that they had for their own lives.
 J.D. Vance, an ex-marine, a Yale law school graduate and self-proclaimed hillbilly, provides an absolutely unique, heart-wrenching and poignant analysis of his culture - the poor white working class.
If you believe that hard work pays off, then you work hard; if you think it’s hard to get ahead even when you try, then why try at all? 
 J.D. Vance's family originated from the Appalachia region in Kentucky but he spent most of his childhood in Ohio. And while he felt the all-consuming love from his grandparents, he also suffered through a tumultuous childhood, unstable mother and unending poverty. 
Psychologists call it “learned helplessness” when a person believes, as I did during my youth, that the choices I made had no effect on the outcomes in my life.
 And yet, he managed to pull himself out of the dregs and live a relatively normal life. So, what made him unique? What events occurred to ensure that his life was different? What kept him from being a statistic? 
I don't know what the answer is, precisely, but I know it starts when we stop blaming Obama or Bush or faceless companies and ask ourselves what we can do to make things better.
 This book was 
enthralling
 - I was thoroughly hooked from start to finish. Definitely one to check out!Audiobook CommentsRead by the author! I always love it when that happens. And J.D. Vance was a superb reader - an absolute delight to listen to!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads!121!This is an incredibly fascinating and well done book. I think that the thoughts and opinions of the author might be controversial, but he lived through it and saw the good and the bad so I will give him the benefit of the doubt on how he sees things after the way he grew up!When I saw the name, I figured this would be reading about a real life Deliverance-esque town. However, this is more about how a boy develops into a man when dealing with being raised by a family with a “Hillbilly” background. The setting is suburban Ohio where many Hillbillies have relocated for blue collar jobs. In fact, the town is Middletown, Ohio, which is not far from where I was growing up at the same time that the events of this book were taking place (Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati). Because of this, it hit home even more for me. When I say that his opinions might come across as controversial, it is because he gives his opinions about his upbringing and the Hillbilly culture and how he had to struggle to overcome it. Some of what he says might get people riled up if it came from an outsider. But, again, since he lived with it – I feel like his input and opinion are a very important viewpoint.I did a little background search on this book and the author online. It sounds like there are some people who scoff at this book because it isn’t about a Deliverance-esque town, the author is well spoken, and he does not necessarily paint the Hillbilly culture in the best light. I agree that all these things are true about the book, but I think that is what makes it even more fascinating and amazing to me. When you read this, you will probably be surprised that he made it away from abuse, drug use, poverty, and crime at all. Is he supposed to feel bad about that? I think that some people think that he should; kind of like he turned his back on his rootsIf a thought provoking book about growing up in lower middle class suburbia over the past 30-40 years sounds interesting to you, this is your book. I can easily recommend this book to anyone who loves a good memoir.!121!Hell hath no fury like a strong Protestant Work Ethic without work. Okay – that was my original, but it should have been Vance’s! Instead, he mostly blamed the poor for being poor, lazy, and generally culpable for all (and few) choices. No wonder anger and angst filled their days and nights, and they needed drugs, alcohol, and violence to trigger some brief if dysfunctional relief. Vance was born right after the decades of American prosperity post WWII when if you wanted a job you simply got one. Vance sneering that people do not realize how lazy they are and presenting that human failure as a social problem indicates a lack of understanding both who the poor are and what they do in the US, as well as what has happened to the industrial Midwest. President Elect Trump negotiated last week with Carrier to keep 1000 jobs in the Rustbelt or “rustexit” (as Michael Moore correctly called it as a vote bloc) area of Indiana. Paul Krugman calculated that even “if Trump did a Carrier-style deal every week for the next 4 years, he could bring back 4% of the manufacturing jobs lost since 2000.” For the greater Middletown, Ohio area that Vance is from it’s not about shoring up an ailing, regional economy but rather to face the demise of an economy that has drastically changed what Max Weber called generational “life chances”, including the perception and reality of those.Middletown, OH is only about 50 miles from where I was born in Muncie, IN and where I still have a large, extended family, so I relate quite strongly to his story, although my ""hillbilly"" family, also a mix of working- and middle-class, was quite the opposite of his often violent and abusive one. Indeed, while I’m fully aware of domestic violence and drug abuse statistics, I’m not sure we should take his family as generalizable although it’s a familiar rendition of the typical, “poor White trash” family (an ethos that stretches from the lowest rungs of socio-economic status through some parts of the middle-class, as with Vance’s family). Does his story warrants the blanket acceptance that this is what people in this area are like? The real story is the downward mobility of the US middle class back to the working class, not the lack of hard work or enough hard work by the poor who were and aspired to stay McWASPs, as is said (Middle-class, White Anglo-Saxon Protestants) and a smattering of upwardly-mobile Catholics. Vance’s family and mine share a geographically similar notch along the Bible Belt, a Kryptonite mix of mostly German, English, Irish, Scots, and French stock.I wish Vance would have described our cultural geography more directly for what is it – the US South. The ethos of the South geographically sits like a triangle encompassing all “deep South” states then narrows while shooting up hari-kari-style right through to the Northern border with Canada, encompassing the ethos and ideology of Nixon’s racist “southern strategy” that includes part the Rustbelt states of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and those environs. Urban centers are different (but Indianapolis the “the South”, believe me…) but let no one forget that Indiana was the birthplace of the KKK, after all. Vance joins a large bloc of other lower- through middle-class Whites in the Rustbelt area of the ""South"" that deny the impact of race and nativism on their ideology, behavior, and vote.Patriotism, military, and militarized police states seem normal and something to respect in my extended family, too, although my own set of parents were less so. Bitter resentment and multi-levels of “trigger happy” reactions (with actual guns and also their anger) physicality was similar – I was the size and strength of my linebacker dad so relished all the wrestling we regularly did with both children and adults involved. We played hard and rough, stopping only when somebody got hurt. Even then, men would tell crying children with a hurt arm, for example, to “wipe it off”, as if the pain would then stop. Even though many in my family were hunters, I didn’t know anybody who carried guns on their person, nor the similar ‘trigger happy” personalities, ready to grab their guns or spit the f-word with threats if somebody looked at them or their kin “wrong”.My family also shared Vance’s fierce loyalty, but embraced the opposite of his family’s fear and suspicion of “outsiders” and strangers. There were some fights, but generally issues were talked out, sometimes loudly, then the modeled behavior was to laugh and move on. The laughing part was key, and I hope Vance got some of that. Vance’s family often had a violent or abusive element featuring how Mamaw was threatening to virtually all others outside her family. Several weeks after reading, Mamaw seems a bit less funny or lovable. Yes, she was clearly the main entertainment in the book, and she was Vance’s “rock”. While we can be grateful for that, but I don’t think that Appalachian women generally use the f-word in every sentence like she did, and I didn’t know anybody then who carried guns on their person, even though most all were hunters and my uncle owned a large gun shop. Some of Mamaw and his mom seems more like mental illness the further out I go from this reading, and I’m not sure we can take it as “hillbilly” common.As girls of 7 and 9, and right before my own nuclear family of six schismed away from the “clan” out to Wyoming, we took a summer-long class at a local university called White Gloves and Party Manners. Here, aspirational working-to-middle class Whites in the late 60s learned etiquette, genteel politeness. My grandparents and parents were taught to be social, to engage people directly and fearlessly, but with civility and a laugh, if possible. I wonder if Vance was blaming culture or genes on the possible mental illness in his family? I remember some powerful fights – more with words but sometimes physical - in and out of my family in that Indiana small town, but it wasn’t typical or common. We all worked hard and played hard. Starting at age 16, even though I should have focused on academics (and getting out of high school and into college early) I worked at K-Mart merging full-time work, full-time school, and full-time social life (with youth exquisitely wasted on youth, surely). Working hard is what everybody did, although it was a generation before Vance’s when everybody was employed (including the Blacks on the other side of the tracks in the small city down the road from our small town.My Grandma repeatedly said that there were two kind of people, the ""here I am!"" and the ""there you are!"" type, and reminded us grandkids that WE are the latter! Her ethics and manners were, as females are still socialized, of a selfless focus on the other. She also told my mother than a kindly Black woman they passed and chatted with on the street “couldn’t help that she was Black”, and was a nice woman. She told me we must be nice to Black people, but “we’d NEVER marry a Black, as that would be unfair to the children!” She had trained to teach elementary school, and I was in awe when she was “installed” as some Grand Queen of the Masonic Temple. This was back when social capital was strong and created and accumulated as most adults in the US were involved with some kind of community or social groups, whether Lion’s Club, Masons, or just a bowling league, as Robert Putnam uses as a metaphor in Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. My Grandpa repeatedly said, ""you're entitled to my opinion, even if it's wrong!"" With his high school education before the Army, he'd figured out the need for a tolerant relativism in a pluralistic, civil society, yet also realized without studying moral development theory that judgment or some kind of stance always should come back into play, too.  Much of the strength of Vance’s descriptions lie in how vulnerable are our children in one of the wealthiest countries of the world with only thin policies and support for the family that struggles to take care of itself, by itself. I often ask undergraduates if they believe that we've set up our country to ""do"" family well - to support them staying intact. Virtually all of them disagree. Vance is right to ask what role culture played in his family’s plight, but it’s really the abuse, violence, and drug addiction for which I hold the culture accountable well over individual choice. An important study to me was one on the variable of resiliency for children – what creates it, enforces it, and erodes it. Resiliency here included perceptions of safety, well-being, and the potential for self-advocacy. I was taken that a “resiliency index” was strongest for children that believed that there exist two adults that would do anything for them - that essentially ""had their backs"". These adults did not have to be heterosexual parents, or even relatives, or even nearby, but the child was secure in the knowledge that one of ""their"" people, even if halfway around the world, would do whatever they could to get to the child if needed.Ultimately, this is all that Vance describes – a memoir (as he correctly titles), an auto-biography, not social science (it’s a problem this is categorized as “sociology”) as the story is based on the perceptual arc of a single individual spinning through his own life. Even though Vance discusses and sometimes argues about recollections he discussed (especially with his sister, as I recall) this is basically a “sample size of one” (as social theorist Peggy McIntosh said she wished to rehabilitate). It is a biography. Why is this important? Because I suspect his family was not the typical “Appalachian Scot Irish” as he insisted they, and he, were throughout the work. There were just as many Germans and English as Scot-Irish, or even just Irish, in the tri-state area where Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana join and from where both our families hailed. Certainly, there was much mixing of White ethics during the approximately six-to-ten generations from the 17th- and 18th-century Scot-Irish migration until Vance’s birth in the late 20th century. To understand the ethnic enclaves that did survive into the 20th century and the mix of White Ethnics are make up our Midwest roots, I’d suggest (rise of the…) I am interested to get the Ancestry DNA test at some point, to see what percentages I am of German-English-Scot-Irish and French, and perhaps Vance should take the test, too, to see how strong or “pure” his Scot-Irish roots really are.I was annoyed at how Vance inserted data to back up his view of his family and the community, and seemed to over-generalize with them. Still, the problem is more with what “sociology” has become, where anyone can quickly rake the coals of their particular foci through the research e-bases, and wrap theory around their anecdotes. I could not get a sense of the research tidbits he scattered through this, but do hope some younger sociologists are following up with better statistical data. I sensed he had considerable loathing for his family and other like types in his community, and, by extension, himself? I believe he was trying to be honest, and I appreciated his sardonic and deprecating humor. Surely he, like me, were taught to try to do good acts while trying not to take much of life too seriously. My parents constantly say, “don’t sweat the small stuff”, so perhaps that life stance may be a Midwestern defense mechanism, too.The crime, truly, is that so many women in his family were pregnant much too early. Instead of casting that as part of a problem with either the “culture” or the “family”, he tends to shade his view of his mother as an object of pure disdain for low or missing morals, essentially a prostitute, with a rotating door of boyfriends and husbands and the threat of domestic violence almost often present. We know that, for example, teen mothers have greater risk, statistically, of lack of education, under- and unemployment, and domestic violence. In the US, close to a third of US teenagers are pregnant by age 19, and with just a third of those ending in abortions at this point – a number down considerably. The US teen pregnancy rate is 5-6 times higher than that in comparable European countries, with no less sexually active teens but with comprehensive sex education and access to birth control. As the AAUW noted several decades ago, sex education is “Civil Rights” for women, but in many Conservative, more rural areas of the US it is a joke. I did appreciate how Vance learned “never say never” and while enforcing strict boundaries against his mother for his own psychological well-being, he also decided he should help his mom. I fear Vance didn’t see that Mamaw viciously hating each of the men that came in and out of her daughter’s life was likely the projected pain of limited opportunity in Mamaw’s own life.Remember that Late Capitalism started with its Golden Era post-WWII, when people like his Pawpaw got jobs just by going out and getting one. By the time Vance was born, it was almost a decade after the “falling rate of profit” for capitalism, and the “land of plenty” was in terms of good jobs. “Choice” enjoys a consistent reign as a central metaphor for hyper-individualism in capitalism. Vance is right that individual accountability matters, but “it’s the economy, stupid”, and he errs on the side of blaming the community and the individuals within it for their plight. As others have noted, and how advertising by FOX News confirms, the worst part of this book is how racism and race resentment among lower- to middle-class Whites, largely un- or under-educated in the Midwest, is hidden and denied. I assume this was Vance’s conscious decision, and he even said something to the effect of not focusing on race (can we say asserting White Privilege with impunity?) I slowly went numb with the awareness that Trump would likely pull it off when I realized summer before last that every single member of my extended family in the Indiana was voting for him. This included a large number of Liberal- to Conservative-Methodists (the latter more devout), a good number of evangelist-fundamentalists, and even the younger, non-religious, and even apolitical ones. The hypocrisy of the White evangelicals voting for Trump was made possible by nativist-racist fear, the thing that Vance said makes little difference. Rust-belt, moderate Christianity has been on a trajectory to the right over the last couple generations, and that movement certainly quickened with this election. My cousins generally found the American Dream and are doing as well economically as our parents, but it looks considerably bleaker for the next generation, made more scared (and thus Conservative) as those that went to college face overwhelming student loans and few prospects for jobs that will keep them in the middle-class. I’m skeptical of how typical is Vance’s family of violence, abuse, and suspicion (and I share details of mine from the same ‘hood) and am taken on how other reviewers just assume Vance’s family is typical and generalizable. While I tried to parse out both similarities and differences between our families, I would add to the former the assumption that Vance’s family voted for Trump as did mine. One of the best summaries about what has happened to “our” people in the Midwest and how there are no easy answers was right after the election in The Atlantic here: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/a....  For my money, there are many better reads to understand Midwest poverty, including Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City that I briefly reviewed. In the US, blaming the poor for being poor is an art form. We're socialized to blame it on individual ""choices"" and lack of ""responsibility"" rather than the social structural causes of poverty. Most in the US don't know who the poor are, so they accept Vance’s characterization of masses of lazy people not working at all. Census data from 2010 shows us that 80% of US homes are of are ""working poor"" (in which at least one adult works at least part-time – often seasonal or piecemeal) and not the benefit-collecting ""welfare poor"". Many don’t realize that a family of four does not meet the technical definition of poor if it makes over about $25K/year in income. Michael Higgins' Somos Tocayos on views of poverty argues that we tend to have two answers to the question of ""why poverty?"": either the social-structural or individual causes. Both views, however, rest of the notion of fate: the mistaken notion and validation of middle-class ideology that poverty is a hopeless, insurmountable social condition.This was only my second “book on tape”, but I’m looking forward to my next one. With six CDs, it took about 9 hours and was a relaxing way to pass the commuting time over several weeks. If anybody would like it, I’d be happy to drop it in the mail if you’d PM me with your address.!121!The first problem I had with this book is the author is a bonehead. On page 8 he tells us “I have known many welfare queens; some were neighbors, and all were white.” I have no idea what I’m supposed to make of that statement. Or actually yes I do know but even so I try to look away. Because of course “welfare queen” is a derogatory term used by people of means to deride the poor, and of course it’s most commonly used to demean and dehumanize urban black poor women, but an author bragging that he knows white “welfare queens” doesn’t really get to the core problem of using a derogatory term to describe poor women, does it? I guess he thinks himself enlightened for declaring that poor people of all colors are equally lazy and undeserving. The entire book is based on the premise that the poor are poor because they are lazy and bitter.The second problem I had with this supposed memoir is it has all the depth and compassion of a Three Stooges episode. It’s an endless string of anecdotes that involve outrageous behavior, destruction of property, and/or grave bodily harm. Take for instance a time when someone douses another someone with gasoline and sets that someone on fire. Don’t worry! No one was seriously hurt! It’s okay to laugh! Or if anyone was hurt, they deserved it! Also don’t forget that hillbilly folk actually like to hurt one another, because we’re all kind of stupid and lazy! Except me, because I went to Yale and made something of myself, just like anyone can, if they have grit and spitfire!Ok. That's about it.!121!Update.... Paul and I watched only about 30 minutes of the movie on Netflix. We both felt it was way too dark. It didn’t feel as authentic as the book. The cinematography was gorgeous in many parts of the movie... but with an award winning director, and two award-winning actresses… All is who I totally respect and admire their talents—-We both felt it was way too depressing and the acting was uneven and the directing was uneven. We just had to turn it off and are not going to finish it. Thoughts from others? Audiobook..... read by the author. My local book club will be discussing this book this month. I’ll be attending- I almost took a ‘pass’. I’m really glad I didn't. THE CONTROVERSY and DISCUSSIONS from reviews on Goodreads is already ENGAGING!!!! Seriously, I spent more time reading through every review - and all the comments on THIS BOOK - more than any book in all my years on Goodreads. My interest elevated - and my emotions were entangled. The passion of expression from people about this book - positive and negative - both - shook me up in a way that's hard to explain. Julie's review had me in tears. April's review deepen my compassion for pure courage. Diane first brought awareness to me that this is a ""timely"" book, Rae express Mamaw and Papaw sooo lovely - ( I melted again reading about them especially after having my own experience too)... and Melora brought up points that I spent time thinking about. My entire review could be about my inspiration from something everyone else has said.So.... I'm going to express random notes:I WAS engaged while listening to Vance's Appalachian roots in Eastern Kentucky and the rust-belt city of Middletown, Ohio. Although he grew up in an unstable family --(abuse, abandonment, and poverty)-- his grandparents ( Mamaw and Papaw), were strong positive influences. It was hard NOT to give Vance my full attention with the type of stories he was sharing. Vance has a VERY PLEASANT AUTHENTIC SOUNDING speaking voice by the way. He is very 'easy-on-the-ears'. Half way through this audiobook---I started to notice a problem beginning with the title of the book. If the title were ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir"".. that would have been. Enough!!!!Once he added family -Culture - and Crisis into the title.....my expectations as a reader was different than and ordinary memoir'. So, the intentions of this book - memoir - purpose - cautionary tale - all get a little blurry. What we 'mostly' get is a straight memoir. BUT.... at some point I started having so much fun--- ( fun not being the best word for all this tragedy)...but yes I started enjoying listening to Vance so much I no longer cared what the name of this book was--or even his purpose. My first belly laugh came when he wanted to stick a golf club in a guys ear. I actually liked when Vance used profanity, because it seemed against his character to who he is or the experience I was getting from him anyway.... His voice sounds so darn level headed - kind -inappropriate and smart- that I actually had a hard time imagining him being the little kid of some of these horrific things he was telling us. Something about hearing it, as opposed to reading it... from a very successful conservative responsible American -- kinda blew my mind. I'm glad I listened to the audiobook. It wasn't a picnic hearing about how his mother physically beat him, but I sure was touched by his love for his sister. It's inspiring to listen to Vance share his story - his thoughts - and he did contribute some awareness about the culture.......""ALL RICH PEOPLE PLAY GOLF""... ( you can laugh now... but he does talk about this)... It's all a little funny. For me....it comes down to --in the end --I basically really like the guy. He touched my heart. I also want to thank so many people for 'their' reviews--readers here on Goodreads -- all your reviews and comments made a big difference to me. This is really a community book in my opinion.!121!Three month non-ranty political review time is ovvvvvvvvvvvvvvver. Woo Hoo!!! Loooooook out Beeoooootcheeees!“I know you real Americans hate being called stupid, but you gotta meet me half way and stop being stupid.”Bill MaherMy empathy level for stupid Americans has diminished this last year. I have un-friended a few people I once thought to be good, intelligent, and sane. This year has opened my eyes to an ugliness and a selfishness in people that I never imagined existed in so many. And that doesn't mean I AM LESS tolerant. It means I have less empathy and sympathy for people who lack empathy and are devoid of tolerance. I am a proud Libretard-I own it. Because Libretards care about the environment, wildlife, and future generations. They care about people who have fallen through the cracks. People who need a boost up...other races...other religions...people who may not always fit the white Christian mold. I am not a hypocrite who says I believe in one thing yet lives and breathes another. I am law-abiding agnostic- with good values...and if I whole-heartedly ever decide to believe in Jesus and God- I know they would be absolutely ashamed at what is playing out in the USA at the moment. I am sorry folks...but Jesus and God would be Libretards- Trump put out there as a test by SATAN!! Oh, and by the way...YOU ALL FAILED miserably.If I could choose one word to express my feelings about HILLBILLY ELEGY it would be conflicted. Because I usually have all the feeeeelz for people who have had hard knock lives....but the hillbillies that voted for Trump obviously failed to think about anyone but themselves- they refused to see a bigger picture for the world as a whole with their ""America first"" bull#%@t. They also voted against themselves in their absolute ignorance of the facts laid out before them. Why?...This is where this book came in- but even after reading (listening to) it-I still don't completely get it.As half Canadian I understand what it is like to be stereotyped and ignored. Some see us this way...Your right-wing ""Fair and Balanced"" Fox ""News"" has been especially kind over the years...and sees us this way...Anne Coulter talking about invading us...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Eq9...Tucker Carleson calling us stalkers and retarded...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_nC...Or Fox making fun of our military just days before 4 dead soldiers were about to shipped home. ""Oh, I didn't even know Canada was fighting with us in Afghanistan Hahahahaha...really?""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVRx0...So yeah- this part I get.......but I do not get why women and the poor voted against their best interest. I do not get how you ignored and still ignore the facts today. I don't get why you blame your government, immigrants, minorities, proven science and a changing world for everything that is wrong with your life. I don't get why you chose a lying millionaire, conman, who doesn't care about anything but himself as your savior- and why you are still the holdouts who have faith in this idiot even though he has proven himself to be beyond incompetent, corrupt, and dangerous- over and over again for the last 90+ days.J.D Vance did little to convince me to empathize with the hillbilly plight. I found him a tad obnoxious (not everyone is lucky enough to have people who love and support them in their endeavors. It makes a BIG difference J.D)...and if I never hear the words Mamaw and Papaw again that would be wonderful. Maybe I would have found it less cringe-worthy if I had been reading it instead of listening to them repeated over and over again in his voice...I do not know. I am not going to read it next time to find out. Once is enough thank you very much.!121!UNA TRANQUILLA INFANZIA DI PAURA Bandiera americana sulle colline di Altoona, Pennsylvania, alla vigilia delle elezioni presidenziali del 2016.Il lancio lo presenta come il libro che spiega il successo elettorale di Trump. Qualcuno dice che è il caso editoriale dell’anno scorso, ha venduto un milione di copie in nove mesi, è tradotto in diversi paesi, e per essere l’esordio di uno sconosciuto avvocato sotto forma di saggio autobiografico, è un traguardo ragguardevole. Il suo autore è diventato un oracolo politico, commentatore della CNN, ascoltato politologo, intervistato ogni giorno. Un homeless di East Liverpool, Ohio, area a maggioranza bianca duramente colpita da disoccupazione e tossicodipendenza.Ma J.D.Vance, pur dichiarandosi repubblicano, non ha votato Trump del quale dice in un’intervista:Ho votato per Evan McMullin, il candidato indipendente-repubblicano dello Utah. Trump aveva individuato un po’ di problemi, ma non aveva nessuna strategia per portare del lavoro nella regione che mi sta a cuore. Trump fa le cose facili. Il problema per l’America del 21esimo secolo non è riportare indietro il lavoro che abbiamo perso, ma riuscire a prepararci per una nuova generazione di lavori. Questo significa istruzione, formazione. L’orologio non torna indietro, le miniere non verranno riaperte. Trump potrà avere anche qualche successo, ma se non riuscirà, la gente sarà frustrata e arrabbiata e si rivolgerà all’opposizione. Le parole durano poco nella politica americana, i risultati invece sono premiati nel tempo.Sostenitori di Donald Trump.Inoltre, i sondaggi dicono che a votare Trump con più ardore e accanimento non sono stati gli elettori più poveri, ma piuttosto i piccolo-borghesi, la classe tradizionalmente più attratta dal fascismo. In queste pagine, invece, si parla di un’altra classe sociale, il proletariato operaio diventato sottoproletariato con la crisi (trasformazione iniziata ben prima del 2008, impoverimento e marginalizzazione progressivi per conseguenza della globalizzazione), un folto gruppo umano che sopravvive sull’assistenza pubblica (welfare), senza casa (homeless) alcolisti, tossici (non solo droghe, anche: sonniferi, antidolorifici, analgesici, medicine in genere - infatti, nella parte di Stati Uniti di cui parla Vance, ci sono piccole contee in cui la McKesson, la più grande distributrice americana di farmaci, spedisce centinaia di milioni di pillole).Sono bianco, ma non mi identifico di sicuro nei WASP, i bianchi anglosassoni e protestanti del Nordest. Mi identifico invece con i milioni di proletari bianchi di origine irlandese e scozzese che non sono andati all’università. Per questa gente, la povertà è una tradizione di famiglia: i loro antenati erano braccianti nell’economia schiavista del Sud, poi mezzadri, minatori e infine, in tempi più recenti, meccanici e operai. Gli americani li chiamano hillbilly (buzzurri, montanari), redneck (colli rossi) o white trash (spazzatura bianca). Io li chiamo vicini di casa, amici e familiari..La parte di Stati Uniti di cui parla Vance è quella soprannominata Rust Belt, la fascia dei Monti Appalachi: Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, nel Sud del paese. Le acciaierie (e The Deer Hunter brilla nella memoria), fabbriche e industrie in generale sono dislocate, ridimensionate, chiuse. Gli operai finiscono a vivere di sussidi pubblici. Ed è quella parte di paese che la globalizzazione ha reso senza opportunità, dove il sogno si è inceppato e non si realizza più, è nel Sud, nella Rust Belt e negli Appalachi che i poveri sono destinati a rimanere poveri, a restare senza santi in paradiso, bianchi relitti urbani. È quella parte del paese dove l’epidemia di eroina e oppiacei (ossicodone, idrocodone, fentanyl, 35 mila morti solo nel 2015) colpisce di più: c’è un’impennata nazionale delle morti per overdose di oppiacei, che per la prima volta superano le morti per arma da fuoco e, di nuovo per la prima volta dal 1993, hanno fatto abbassare l’aspettativa di vita americana. Amy Adams, sempre notevole, Gabriel Basso e Haley Bennet, con Glenn Close, sono i protagonisti dell’omonimo recente film Netflix diretto da Ron Howard.A dire il vero, globalizzazione a parte, e a parte la crisi del 2008, si direbbe che è una parte di USA dove la povertà è sempre rimasta endemica, un proletariato che in 150 anni si è spostato inseguendo la produzione industriale, ma mai avvicinandosi al Sogno Americano. Sono loro i volti disperati delle famose fotografie di Walker Evans durante la Depressione, i tontoloni protagonisti delle barzellette, gli ignoranti, chiusi, lontani dal mondo.Nel mondo che J.D.Vance ha conosciuto e frequentato, nell’ambiente in cui è cresciuto e che lo ha circondato, litigare senza alzare la voce e senza ricorrere a brutali insulti tutti i giorni, bere moderatamente, o astenersene perfino nelle occasioni sociali, ricorrere a punizioni corporali senza eccesso come strumenti di correzione più che punizione, senza accompagnare le sculacciate a cattiveria, urla e parolacce, erano eccezione, erano miraggio.Un film da Oscar, Un tranquillo weekend di paura, nel 1973 mostrava le terribili avventure della gente di città che si spinge nelle loro terre. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhnA...Un momento di marca hillbilly in un film capolavoro – questa scena è rimasta nella storia come Dueling Banjos.La coppia protagonista del mitico Duelling Banjos 40 anni dopo: a sinistra l’attore Ronnie Cox, a destra il ragazzino del banjo, Billy Redden. Per rRedden il film di Boorman fu la prima e ultima esperienza cinematografica.Nella vita politica c’è sempre stato interesse a usarli come argine contro l’emancipazione dei neri e, a parte la stagione kennediana degli anni Sessanta, quando le fotografie di John e Bob erano appese e venerate nelle catapecchie di legno, gli hillbilly tornarono a Nixon e ai repubblicani. Obama era riuscito a conquistare questi Stati con i massicci aiuti che aveva dato a industrie fallimentari, ma la globalizzazione ha lavorato contro. Le fabbriche sono andate via (i sindacati erano già stati cacciati).Le grandi miniere di carbone, ormai troppo costose e inquinanti, sono irrimediabilmente chiuse. Lì lavorava il padre di J.D.Vance, ed era alcolizzato pur avendo lavoro. Glenn Close e Amy Adams nel film.C’è comunque buona sintonia tra il linguaggio rozzo, misogino, arrogante di Trump e la quotidianità dell’eterna depressione descritta da Vance. Come evidente appare che in questa parte del paese una donna di città (Hillary), diventata ricca, amica dei banchieri, una snob, una liberal, una che vorrebbe togliere agli hillbilly i loro fucili, in luoghi in cui i preti li benedicono e tuonano contro l’aborto, non ha mai rappresentato una vera alternativa a Donald Bellicapelli. In comunità dove si impara fin da piccoli ad alzare i pugni se qualcuno offende tua madre, dove nessun sogno si è mai realizzato, le scuole cadono a pezzi, l’eroina e gli analgesici hanno sempre avuto un consumo altissimo, i discorsi razzisti, ad alzo zero, di chiusura, di arretramento del candidato repubblicano sono stati ben accolti e hanno trovato terreno favorevole.Le pagine più toccanti del libro di Vance riguardano proprio la tossicodipendenza. Il padre minatore attaccato alla bottiglia e la madre che tentò di dargli fuoco con la benzina. La stessa madre, infermiera, che prese a iniettarsi eroina e che faceva pisciare il piccolo J. D. al posto suo quando all’ospedale facevano i test antidroga. La madre che cambia cinque fidanzati e si sposa altre tre volte; otto amici morti di overdose, il nonno e la nonna (gli adorati Papaw e Mamaw) che lo adottano e lo portano fino all’arruolamento nei Marines e, dopo quattro anni di Iraq, all’università. C’è molta violenza nel libro, ma anche rispetto per un’umanità nella miseria e nella disperazione, un senso di amicizia e lealtà, una solidarietà tra consapevoli perdenti che J.D. Vance riesce a trasmettere. E si tende a dargli ragione quando dice:Ho l’impressione che il capitale umano che si trova sui monti Appalachi non sia stato costruito per il 21esimo secolo.”The Deer Hunter-Il cacciatore” di Michael Cimino, 1978. I cinque amici escono dall’acciaieria per preparararsi al weekend: caccia al cervo, matrimonio, a seguire partenza per il Vietnam, con un attacco di montaggio rimasto nella storia. Gli amici sono: Robert DeNiro-Mike, Christopher Walken-Nick, John Savage-Steven, John Cazale-Stan, eChuck Aspegren-Axel – l’assente in questa still è l’amico proprietario del bar, George Dzundza, dove si svolge una delle scene più belle che il cinema ci abbia mai regalato. Eccola…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V95cS...!121!Possibly the most timely read of the year, here in the United States. Not just a sociological view of this group of people I had heard nor read little about, but the experiences of a young man raised in this environment and pulled himself out, though he does acknowledge to receiving much help along the way. This book enlightens the reader about the huge disparity in thinking between those making the leas and those receiving the benefits of these laws, which probably hinder more than help. His story, his journey is inspirational, his thoughts provoking, and his story clear, concise and well told. The working class is seriously under represented in this country, and lack of knowledge and insight is a huge factor in why this has happened. Learned helplessness, a very good term and one it is hard to disagree with. He makes it clear that he loves his family, warts and all but his special connection and the help he received from his memaw was priceless. She was his saving grace. Some of his family members, an aunt, his sister, have broken the chain of drug use, alcoholism, many partners in and out, as they both have long marriages behind them. Vance does go into some sociological aspects, explains the exodus of many from his small Kentucky town to Ohio, jobs offered by the new steel mill being the draw, the problems those who moved away from their families experienced. All in all this is a very informative book, Vance's story both harrowing and touching in turns.!121!5/4/2022. I am revising my review of this book because the author has proven himself to be a sham with his embracing of Donald Trump in order to win the primary in Ohio. If he can revise his opinion of DT just to get elected, how do we know anything in this book is even true? We certainly don't need more lying, unethical politicians in this country. Down to one star, and it doesn't really deserve that.I am not quite as enamored of this book as a lot of people. It tells this young man's story of his journey out of poverty and violence into the world of an elite pursuer of the American Dream. He had luck, intelligence, and a Mamaw and Papaw who cared enough to help him along. The Marine Corp was another catalyst into the good life. He was smart enough to use all these things as a way out of a downward spiral.I'm not sure where the idea that this book explains Donald Trump's rise came from, but I didn't get that here. I found it to be just another book about a dysfunctional family, and a guy who was able to escape. Had to hand it to Mamaw though, she was one tough old biddy.!121!UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 14, 2023""Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has called out members of his own party for putting their political ambitions ahead of the best interests of the nation.""And there’s one GOP lawmaker in particular he seems to have special disdain for.""'I don’t know that I can disrespect someone more than J.D. Vance,' Romney told journalist McKay Coppins during Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign, according to a book excerpt published Wednesday in The Atlantic.""Romney, who on Wednesday announced he will not seek reelection next year, told Coppins at the time that he was impressed by Vance after reading his book, Hillbilly Elegy.""That changed when Vance went full MAGA and embraced Donald Trump as he ran for the Senate.“'How can you go over a line so stark as that — and for what?' Romney said. 'It’s not like you’re going to be famous and powerful because you became a United States senator. It’s like, really? You sell yourself so cheap?'"" -- Huffpost UPDATE: JUNE 21, 2023""... Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, announced that he intended to block all of the Biden administration's nominees for Justice Department jobs, because he's angry that the department indicted Mr. Trump for purloining classified military secrets from the White House and lying to investigators about it.""-- David Firestone, The New York TimesUPDATE: MAY 13. 2022Why would I retract the good things I wrote about J.D. Vance in my review? Read this: Vance used various descriptions of his disdain for Trump. Vance said he was a “Never Trump guy,” “never liked him,” “will never vote for Trump,” “loathed” Trump, called Trump’s election “terrible for the country,” and described him as “dangerous” and “reprehensible.” Vance claimed to have voted for Independent candidate Evan McMullin in 2016, but previously said he might vote for Hillary Clinton if it appeared that Trump would win in 2016. Vance criticized Trump’s policy proposals, saying they ranged “from immoral to absurd.” Vance likened Trump’s candidacy to heroin for his supporters and accused him of appealing to racism and xenophobia. Vance expressed support for women who accused Trump of sexually assaulting them, and wondered on Twitter “what percentage of the American population has @RealDonaldTrump sexually assaulted?” -- HuffpostUPDATE: APRIL 24, 2022Vance told an audience earlier this week that Trump was the “greatest president of my lifetime.”“We’ve got a ridiculous leadership, even on the Republican side, that tries to undo some of the best things that Donald Trump did over the past four years,” Vance said, after Trump called him up on stage.UPDATE: APRIL 16, 2022Trump Endorses J.D. Vance in Republican Primary for Senate in Ohio -- New York TimesUPDATE: JANUARY 30, 2022""As for Vance, he has pulled off a transformation, morphing into an avid supporter of Trump, whom he once bashed as 'noxious,' 'reprehensible' and an 'idiot.' -- HuffpostUPDATE: JANUARY 25, 2022In light of J.D. Vance's abject, self-abasing, about face surrender to Donald Trump, and his blatantly opportunistic campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate, I hereby retract any positive comments I made about him in my review of his book in 2016.!121!I set dozens of reading goals for 2017, but I won't bore you with all of them. However, this book helped me accomplish two reading goals this year: 1. Read better books2. Read more nonfiction This book, while difficult to read at times, is an important book, and I can't recommend it enough. It hit me pretty hard at times. I mean, I wouldn't consider myself a hillbilly, but i did grow up in the suburbs of Nashville, and I'm honestly not too far removed from some of the family members depicted in the book. Im very fortunate, but, man some of the people and scenes depicted here feel like stories I've heard from my own family. And it's crazy because it wasn't until I grew up and moved out that I got to hear about all the craziness in my extended family. Families are insane. There are so many great books and memoirs out there now that peel back the curtain on what it's like to be black, Muslim, female, Hispanic, whatever. So, yeah, it's weird to read a book from a 30 year old white guy and think he has something interesting to bring to the table. He does have something to bring to the table though. A whole class of people that are living and fighting to survive and dreaming and voting and being pushed to the fringes of society. Hillbillies. Who knew?Vance's stories of his upbringing are jaw-dropping and feel more like fiction at times. We quickly learn his childhood was anything but ideal as he walks us though various phases that shaped who he is today. While these stories were both terrifying and heartbreaking to read, it was his later message of not being a product of your environment that resonated with me. He admits he was fortunate to have people in his life to give him a chance, but he did everything he could to push against the life he found himself in. I also appreciated the humble tone throughout the book. It could have easily read as a guy who had a rough life, but he overcame it and graduated from college, went to Iraq, and graduated from law school at Yale (not in that order). He could have said, ""Look at me! I did it! And you can, too!"" Instead, it's more like, ""I had people in my life who gave me a chance. I carved a different path, but I felt like a fraud most of the time, and I still had a hard time dealing with my past. It wasn't easy. I also want to talk about how to fix the problem that impacts thousands of others, but I don't have the answers. The government can't fix everything."" That's a lot of paraphrasing by the way. Anyway, Hillbilly Elegy is a very eye-opening, important, emotional book to read- but I'm so glad I took the time to read it. It helped me understand some things in my own family structure that I also won't bore you with, and it gave me a new perspective to help relate to others I know with similar stories. It's rare that a nonfiction book read this quickly, but I read more than half of it this evening. You should, too.!121!When I bought this book I didn't really read the title closely so I really just assumed it said Hillbilly Energy and so I like assumed it was going to be something about solar energy on farms, I don't know I have a presumption problem clearly, so I was kind of confused when I started to read the book. The books is readable and I enjoyed in terms of it being one person's memoir. The framing is kind of one that doesn't align with me but we don't all always have to agree. Not much else to say, except the beginning was stronger than the ending, but that's a frequent complaint on my end. Also appreciated that it felt less self absorbed than other memoirs, where I'm usually left just feeling like why do I care about the happenings of this person's life?!121!A well written, thoughtful statement about our culture; where we are now, how we got here and where we could be going.I identify closely with the author: both of us were born poor and from divorced parents, both benefited from military service and both found a way to get through law school (coincidentally even though I am fifteen years Vance’s senior and am closer in age to his mother, he and I were in Iraq at the same time and both worked for military pubic affairs and both took part in civil affairs missions).That’s where the obvious similarities end. Vance’s Yale Law degree is oodles more prestigious than my very humble diploma and on the other end of the spectrum, his hillbilly family is far more dysfunctional than my redneck clan.The difference between “hillbilly” and “redneck” is more of regional semantics than of degree. Both terms identify a member of Scotch-Irish origin and synonymous with pejorative monikers like “white trash”, “poor whites”, “hayseed” and “yokel”.Vance makes the case early on that this European heritage is an important distinction. This ethnic group is a heterogeneous population that brought with it from the Old World a continent sized chip on it’s shoulder, a deeply engrained sense of oppression and dogged rebellion. Most pertinent to our society today is that this is the demographic that seems to have turned isolationist and whose skepticism of government has crossed the border of cynicism and cruised right into xenophobia. If it’s true that the Democratic party lost the middle in 2016, then it’s also likely accurate that this group makes up a big part of that middle.A reader can consider Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America to illuminate how this group has been instrumental in making this country what it is – bad and good. This tendency towards fierce loyalty and family on the one side and self destruction and irrationality on the other is also exemplified by Seán O'Casey’s 1924 drama Juno and the Paycock. Vance brings these dualities to bear on our own time and through the lens of his own experience.Besides Vance’s talented writing, this book succeeds on his unique perspective: he has seen the depths of family dysfunction and the heights of professional and financial attainment. Vance demonstrates both the opportunities available to a young person today and also the deeply held obstacles that make reaching these goals prohibitively difficult and unlikely.A very good book, highly recommended.!121!“One way our upper class can promote upward mobility, then, is not only by pushing wise public policies but by opening their hearts and minds to the newcomers who don’t quite belong.” ― J.D. Vance, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis (my dad's father [center on the stairs], uncle, and other workers during harvest)The writing and conclusions of this book are probably a 3-star, but emotionally this is a 4-star book for me (thus my vacillating between 3&4-stars). J.D. Vance is my father. Reading his memoir is like reading a story about my dad. My dad, like Vance, grew up in a family with a lot of dysfunction. Neither of my dad's parents graduated from high-school. He wasn't a hillbilly, per se, but he was born in a small dry-farm community in the mountains of Southern Idaho. Poor. And he wanted the hell out. He didn't get good grades, but a stint in the Navy and marriage to my mom provided the stability and the perspective that allowed my dad to climb. And climb he did. The GI-bill and my dad's grit enabled him to eventually graduate with honors from UC Davis' Veterinary school. His work ethic still is a thing of wonder to my brothers and sister. He is intimidating. He, by force of will, natural intelligence, etc. climbed (always with the assistance of my mom) up several economic and social rungs. His effort provided middle class, and eventually upper-middle class opportunities for his children. I will have to travel to the moon, I feel, to maintain the same trajectory he set.Vance's story about growing up a hillbilly in Kentucky and Ohio resembles not just my dad but many people I know from many cultures, races, and backgrounds. The positive of this book is Vance's lack of meanness married to his willingness to criticize. That is a fine line, but I think Vance is right. There is no magic bullet, but there are several things that need to come together to help address some of the cultural, economic, and societal challenges facing not just poor whites in Appalachia, but inner-city poor minorities, Native American poor, etc.. Vance and Vance's publishers also benefited from timing. His book was published during the Trump movement of 2016 and 2017 (and yes, we are still trying to understand all of that). Vance seemed to offer SOME explanation why poor whites in Appalachia and the Rust Belt seemed to vote against their interest for a demagogue and pseudo-populist. Vance seemed available with at least SOME answers. If you look at the way this book was published, this book almost seems like a Yale project to get J.D. Vance into congress. A hillbilly Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance. I can't completely go down that caustic hole, but this book seems almost designed as a political answer, as a legitimizer. I have a friend from the poor town in Ohio whose BS radar is high on this book. I'm still not sure. We are a nation that is seeing a huge chasm open up between the haves and the have-nots. There aren't enough bridges, and not enough shepherds helping those on the edge across. I remember thinking about this very issue years ago. It was one area where I felt I needed to take a personal stake in someone else's development and progression. It is hard to see neighbors struggle with debt, single mother's barely keeping their heads above water, addiction, and hardest of all despair. Despair. I don't want to wait until government addresses the income gap. I think, because of the tremendous gift I've been given and the resources attached to that -- that I have a moral responsibility to pass that gift on. My kids will get it naturally enough. They will have a stable home (mostly), education, too much food and exposure to opportunities that will allow them to maneuver through the hurdles and the traps of the modern economy and upper-middle-class culture. What I need to do, because I have been blessed, is find a way to extend this opportunity to more. I really think -- and like Vance I don't have all the answers -- my way is person-to-person. Mentoring. Looking for an opportunity to take a kid who, given the opportunities I was BORN with, could excel me -- and helping her or him out. I've done this a couple times and it is miraculous and I think going forward necessary. Both for the economic survival for our nation, but also for our nation's soul.!121!I didn't really want to read J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, but it sort of felt like a car crash you know is right in front of you. It's tough to keep your eyes closed and not peek. Even before I opened the book, I reflected that the 'hillbilly' culture Vance describes as in crises is the same culture that was in crisis 100 years ago. I wondered whether there was something about these people (my people as it turns out) who just need to act out every so often and make sure they're noticed. There were some insights here; however, early on, I had trouble with Vance's description or defense of racism. Vance seems to excuse the seeming racism of his hillbillies by claiming that it's not skin color that makes them uncomfortable, but rather people who are accomplished/have succeeded. No matter how many times Vance makes this claim, I'm not buying it. It doesn't help when Vance argues, “my people were on the right side….hillbilly justice…the best kind!” As a memoir which describes how powerless his family felt, and how he overcame that dynamic by leaving (“the best way up for the hillbilly is out”) it's more effective. Still, even though I went into the book with mixed feelings, I was hoping for more out of Hillbilly Elegy.!121!Poverty is in the eye of the beholder. My father grew up in the hollers of West Virginia in a small town that hasn’t changed very much (if at all) since he lived there. Oh, wait. They changed the name of the street he grew up on from Pennsylvania Avenue to something sounding less presidential. Other than that, I’d be surprised if anything had changed. His grandfather built the house he grew up in when my grandfather was a little boy in short britches. It was a big jump up from living on the family farm for them. Despite that, or maybe more because of that, my father grew up believing that all men are basically the same, some are good, some not as good, but all are capable of decency. None are of greater worth than another, and all are worthy of respect. Like J.D. Vance, my father was able to move away, find a way to make a living doing something he loved, to rise above the poverty of his youth. I’m not sure that money was his objective, he just wanted to fly, and to a young man in the 1930s/40s, it was an adventure and a dream. His closest friends, for all of his days, were some of those pilots with whom he shared ownership of his first plane, pilots that he shared those early years of flight with. He went back a few times over the years to visit those who still lived there, but he never wanted to return to live there.  “Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks, or white trash. I call them neighbors, friends and family.”  Vance’s family are among the many Scots-Irish who settled in the Appalachians, as were my father’s parents, and a few others who have read this memoir. There was a lot I could relate to what I recall of my father’s tales of growing up “economically disadvantaged,” although Vance lived in a larger area, and two generations apart from my father. What both have so strongly in common is the tie that binds them back to the place where they grew up. A tie that binds them to the journey from the child to the man. “Hillbilly Elegy” is filled with the stories of Vance’s family, some are crazy-sad, some crazy-funny, some you just shake your head at, and some you can how the way he views things isn’t so far from how you might. I especially loved Vance’s views on his struggles, how he learns from them, how he adapted maybe not to those struggles but from them, learned strength from his Mawmaw, and also how to fight from her, learned to love despite the imperfections of others and find the good in what remains. The hardest of all is seeing the good in one’s self, and he is no exception. ""How much of our lives, good and bad, should we credit to our personal decisions, and how much is just the inheritance of our culture, our families, and our parents who have failed their children? How much is Mom's life her own fault? Where does blame stop and sympathy begin?""!121!Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, J.D. VanceVance describes his upbringing and family background in a family from a small town in Ohio. He writes about a family history of poverty and low-paying, physical jobs that have since disappeared or worsened in their guarantees, and compares this life with his perspective after leaving that area and life. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و دوم ماه اکتبر سال2018میلادیعنوان: هیل بیلی: روزگار آمریکایی‌های پشتکوه‌ نشین، خاطرات یک خانواده و یک فرهنگ بحران‌ زده؛ نویسنده: جی.دی ونس ؛ مترجم سیدعلیرضا پارساییان؛ تهران نشر نون، سال‏‫1396؛ در260ص؛ شابک9786008740162؛ عنوان دیگر روزگار آمریکایی‌های پشت‌ کوه‌ نشین، خاطرات یک خانواده و یک فرهنگ بحران‌زده؛ موضوع سرگذشتنامه ی ونس، ج.دی - خانواده - کارگران سفیدپوست - از نویسندگان ایالات متحده - سده21مجی.دی ونس، کودکی‌ خویش را در سرزمینی زندگی کرد، که مردمان آن‌‌جا در بگذشته ها کارگران مناطق دیگر، و معدنچی معادن زغال سنگ بوده‌ اند؛ زندگی مردمان این منطقه از آمریکا، تاثیر فراوانی در سرنوشت، و سبک زندگی این نویسنده داشته است؛ «جی.دی ونس» با اِشراف کامل، از زندگیش کتاب «هیل‌ بیلی» را به نگارش درآورده، که منبع دقیقی برای شناخت مردمان منطقه ی کوهستان «آپالاچيا» است؛ «جی.دی ونس»، نویسنده و سرمایه‌ گذار آمریکایی است، که برای یادمانهای خود، که با عنوان «هیل‌ بیلی» منتشر شد، شناخته شده هستند؛ ایشان در روز دوم ماه آگوست سال1984میلادی در شهر «اوهایو» به دنیا آمدند، و همانند سایر کودکان آن منطقه، با مشکلات اجتماعی زادگاهش روبرو شدند؛ خانواده‌ ی «جی.دی ونس» در کودکی او را ترک کردند، و او در کنار مادربزرگ، و پدربزرگش زندگیش را گذراند.؛ او توانست از دانشگاه دولتی «اوهایو» فارغ التحصیل شود، و پیشرفت او در واقع دستیابی یک نسل رو به رشد، به موفقیت بود.؛ این نویسنده علاوه‌ بر فعالیت در زمینه‌ ی حقوق، و سیاست، مدتی را هم در روزنامه‌ ی «سی.ان.ان» مشغول به کار بوده استنقل نمونه متن: (همان امید همیشگی، چیزی که نمی‌توانستم به آن نه بگویم.؛ همان امید بود که داوطلبانه پایم را به آن جلسات ترک اعتیاد باز کرد؛ جلسه‌های ترک اعتیاد، آن همه کتابی که در مورد اعتیاد خواندم، و مشارکت در فرآیند درمان مادر، تا جاییکه در توانم بود.؛ همان امید باعث می‌شد در دوازده سالگی سوار ماشین او شوم، با علم به اینکه با آن وضع روحیش ممکن است، دست به کاری بزند، که بعدا پشیمانی به بار بیاورد.؛ «ماماو» هیچ‌وقت امیدش را از دست نداد، آن هم بعد از انبوه دل‌ شکستگی‌ها و ناامیدهایی که تعدادشان بیش از اندازه‌ ای بود، که در عقل من بگنجد.؛ زندگی او مدرسه‌ ی آموزش ناامید شدن از مردم بود، ولی «ماماو» همیشه، راهی برای ایمان داشتن به کسانیکه دوستشان داشت، پیدا می‌کرد.؛ سر جمع من هم از آن همه کوتاه آمدنم پشیمان نیستم.؛ انجام خواسته‌ ی مادر در مورد نمونه آزمایش، کار غلطی بود، ولی هرگز از گوش کردن به حرف «ماماو»، پشیمان نخواهم شد.؛ امیدواری او بود، که باعث شد «پاپاو» را، بعد از آن سال‌های سختی که در زندگی مشترک‌شان داشتند، ببخشد، و همین امید «ماماو» را مجاب کرد، من را در زمانیکه بیش‌تر از همیشه به او نیاز داشتم، پیش خودش ببرد.؛ روی «ماماو» را زمین نیانداختم، ولی آن روز صبح، چیزی در درونم فرو ریخت.؛ با چشم‌های سرخ از گریه، به مدرسه رفتم.؛ به شدت از کمکی که به او کرده بودم پشیمان بودم.؛ چند هفته پیش‌تر با مادر در یک غذاخوری چینی نشسته بودم، در حالیکه او تلاش بی‌حاصلی می‌کرد، تا قاشق غذا را داخل دهانش بچپاند.؛ خاطره‌ ای که هنوز هم خون من را به جوش می‌آورد، مادر نمی‌توانست چشمش را باز کند، یا دهانش را ببندد، قاشق غذا تا وارد دهانش می‌شد، برمی‌گشت و می‌ریخت داخل بشقاب.؛ بقیه‌ ی مردم به ما خیره مانده بودند، «کن» زبان بند شده بود، و مادر در دنیای خودش بود، فارغ از این هیاهو.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 07/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 19/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی!121!I am really not impressed by the author's hillbilly credentials. He writes a ""memoir"" at 31 for starters. If you have not read this you may be disappointed as I was because he did NOT grow up in the hills and hollers of Kentucky. His grandmother's family did and she left there for small town Ohio at the ripe old age of 13. He even changed his name to Vance - which is one of his ancient ancestors who was part of the Hatfield and McCoy clan. So much of what he shares is hand me down stories from his grandparents' family. He visits their home town a few times along the way. I do agree it is important to know the story of these Appalachian people and also the struggling white working poor and it gets a couple stars for shining the light on that. I don't believe they are all violent drug addicted trash as portrayed however. And all the connections to Trumpism are very overhyped. So If you are afraid to read this because it is rally for Trump, it is not. I did not get that at all. So if he is a conservative he did not convey that to me in his writing. More importantly, you might be hesitant to read this because it is boring as heck in the way it is told and his woe-is-me attitude. Poor guy didn't know which fork to use at his Yale law firm recruiting dinner nor the difference between Chardonnay and Sauvignon! So maybe I'll write a memoir about growing up with the repercussions of WWII Nazi Germany because my grandparents and mother experienced this. No, I won't wear that badge because I didn't earn it. So why didn't he become a doctor or social worker and go back and help his people or enter a profession where he could create jobs for these forgotten people? We need another DC lawyer like we need a hole in the head. But he sure found a way to use his ""upbringing"" to sell books.!121!First and foremost, let me say that I am not a big non-fiction reader. Every once in a while, I need a change of pace or something catches my eye that isn't my typical smutty romance. Sometimes it works out for me and I learn something new. Other times, the ""enlightening"" read is about as entertaining as having a lobotomy. Sadly, this book fell into the latter category for me.I picked up 'Hillbilly Elegy' because the blurb sounded interesting enough and I really don't know much about the Appalachian people. To be clear, watching 'Deliverance' (or that TV show where they make moonshine in the woods) is just about all of the exposure that I had to the people from that region of the country. Needless to say, I am pretty ignorant of this particular subculture in the United States. I had hoped that listening to this audiobook would provide me with a little insight. I figured that the portrayals of the Appalachian people I'd seen were probably grossly exaggerated in order to increase ratings. I didn't believe that the reality could be so bleak or, for lack of a better term, ""trashy"". Being born in the deep south, I'm very familiar with the way that entire region is often falsely portrayed as being filled with ignorant, uneducated rednecks. I assumed that the same is true for the Appalachian region. That being said, if the people of Appalachia aren't as ""trashy"" as they are portrayed on TV, you would never know it from reading this book. If anything, J. D. Vance's autobiographical account of growing up in his hillbilly home only reinforced every negative stereotype that I know of regarding this subculture. Simply put, this book read like a low-class nightmare.His family was violent, uneducated and proud of breaking the law. Drug and alcohol addiction, as well as chronic unemployment and abuse of the welfare system were common themes. His mother was a real piece of work, with men coming and going with greater frequency than she'd change her underwear. Every time his Mamaw would say something I'd cringe, even though she clearly was the most loving and supportive person in his life. It was nearly unbearable.However, this wasn't a book meant to entertain. This book was written to shed some light on the cultural differences that have resulted in social and economic decline in this region of the country. J. D. Vance certainly shed light on some important social aspects that I was oblivious to before listening to this audiobook. His observations regarding the closed-off nature, and the pride of this group of people, was especially relevant to the discussion. I also appreciated his candid discussion of a declining work ethic, sense of helplessness, domestic violence and abuse of the welfare system. He also offered some insight into some of the networking habits of the wealthy, which are largely neglected by the poor.Although there were some things that I really enjoyed about this book, it was mostly like a slow death by audiobook. As a reader that has a strong preference for fiction, namely smutty romance, I'm probably not the best judge though. If the Appalachian people really are half as depressing as this book makes them out to be, all I can say is that I want to steer clear of that abysmal region. This book was really sad and a whole lot of trashy. Kudos to the author for rising above it.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com!121!This book is the worst, most pernicious type of hack ideological trash. I wanted to read it because it purports to offer a telling sociological portrait of the regions from which my in-laws hail, and the supposed ""hillbilly"" culture that ostensibly defines those same regions (SW Ohio and Kentucky). What this book actually is is a infantile memoir written by a self-hating, self-defining ""hillbilly"" who traffics in right-wing garbage arguments. The book's primary argument is that poor people suffer because they don't know any better because they are poor and don't work hard enough because they don't know any better because they are poor. He of course tries to cloak these pernicious arguments in ""patriotic"" garb. I made it 75% through and had to slam it shut once I got to the part where he pathetically tried to justify racism, and to justify racist right-wing attacks on Pres. Obama in particular. Did he learn how to apologize for racism while he was at Yale? I don't know and I don't care to know. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. JUST PLAIN AWFUL.!121!J.D Vance's grandparents set the basis for this life story. They move from the hills of Kentucky to Ohio chasing a better life. J.D.'s life is in both places. He does live a life that is very familiar here in the southeast. His real dad gives him up, he is told by his mom and Mamaw that his dad doesn't want him anymore. He is adopted by one of his mother's many men. Who also ends up leaving. J.D.'s mom is a revolving door of different men. (I'm not judging her as I see this lifestyle taking place around me daily.)She does manage to end up with nursing degree but then drugs move into her life and she loses even that. Mamaw and Papaw are the saving graces in this man's life. They fought tooth and nail early in their marriage and ended up living at different places and visiting each other during the day. BUT they did install some confidence in this boy. This seems to be typical in this area. My Gran also took me in from a bad homelife and she was as rowdy as Mamaw is in this book. Once when I took her grocery shopping she pulled out her gun and flopped it on the counter and about gave the clerk a heart attack. She didn't cuss as much as Mamaw did but I may just have glossed over that memory. The book is also pretty political, pointing out that most people from this area used to vote Democratic with a vengeance but things they have changed. He takes a look at whether it was President Obama's demeanor that turned average poor southerner's against him. Barack Obama strikes at the heart of our deepest insecurities. He is a good father while many of us aren’t. He wears suits to his job while we wear overalls, if we’re lucky enough to have a job at all. His wife tells us that we shouldn’t be feeding our children certain foods, and we hate her for it—not because we think she’s wrong but because we know she’s right. This does strike a cord with me because I've seen the millions upon millions of facebook posts that my friends and family have posted.Is that why we now have Trump coming into office? He was more approachable to the middle and lower class than Hillary? I remember everyone loving Bill Clinton, but truthfully he was more approachable than his wife was. Who knows? I'm not about to get into a political post. I just observe and do my own thing. Cuz I had a Gran that did teach me to be my own person also.This book did tend to make me think, I laughed with him when Mamaw would blurt out her opinion and I even teared up several times. The reasoning for my rating falls for some of the back patting he did. I got bored as shit in those parts. He does admit to having lots of help on his climb out of bad circumstances to go on to the Marines and Yale Law. So I'll give him props for that.!121!A good friend of mine told me I had to read this if I wanted to understand how Donald Trump won the election. But that's not to say this is a political book. Part memoir and part social treatise, the book attempts to explain the mindset of the poor whites of the Appalachian/Midwest geographic area. Mostly Scotch-Irish, they are a proud people with a split mindset when it comes to beliefs vs. actions, especially concerning work ethic, religion and the value of education. J.D. Vance basically goes beyond the loss of manufacturing jobs in explaining the crisis of what used to be considered the working poor, but is now mostly the non working, white poor. He blames the lack of family and thus, stability, for the crisis. If not for his Mamaw, his grandmother, and the US Marines, he believes he would never have made it out of the quagmire. His Mamaw provided him the stability he never got from his parents. And the Marines taught him self-esteem and discipline. Vance brilliantly explains why this sector of our country has come to feel alienated from the country and from the liberal elite. As he writes, “if you believe that hardwork pays off, you work hard; if you think it's hard to get ahead even when you try, then why bother at all?” Now, if you think Vance is a liberal, you'd be wrong. He identifies as a modern conservative. But he doesn't give them a free pass he thinks they have encouraged the detachment “that has sapped the ambition of so many of my peers”. There are so many deep ideas here that I will be pondering for days to come. Not just the ability to move up or down the economic scale, but who bears the blame for personal failures. I highly recommend the book and also recommend American Nationals: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America, which covers some of the same geography from a purely historic point of view. Is it too soon in the year to have a book I know will be on my top 10?!121!Didn't see what the fuss was about, but maybe that's because I grew up in a small town and am familiar with 'hillbilly' mentality. If you read this and are shocked, then you probably are a part of the 'elite' class and could use the experience of seeing how the other side lives. Actual hillbillies reading this (probably none) might feel inspired by J. D.'s story.There are some moderately intriguing tidbits of political insight. Notably a passage where Vance considers why the Obamas are so resented by poor whites. They hate how articulate and intelligent he is, he hypothesizes, they hate that his wife pushes for healthy eating. Not because she's wrong, but because they know she's right. They think the Obamas are intentionally insulting them by being so goody-goody.He skirts around issues of racism, but to me that's obviously part of the equation. Life is hard, but at least these 'hillbillies' are American. It is my opinion that many of these individuals do not view persons of color as American, however. Maybe it's conscious, maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's history still weighing them down, but it messes with their head when they see non-whites in power. It's why ""birtherism"" can gather such a large following. Anyone of color can't possibly be American! Where were they really born?That's just my armchair hypothesis, of course. I think this book does a good job of staying neutral and letting the reader draw their own conclusions. Rather than try to provide explanations, it focuses on starting a conversation. Unfortunately that didn't appeal to me. I read it hoping for answers; hoping someone could explain to me how the hell Trump is a thing and continues to be. Alas, that mystery remains unsolved. Or maybe it's simply too otherworldly for my comprehension.Anyway, not the worst book out there, but don't expect to be enlightened. I give it a so-so recommendation.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Sociology']"

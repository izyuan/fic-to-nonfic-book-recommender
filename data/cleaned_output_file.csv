n't think literary masterpiece itselft rightfully considered one historically relevant time simple loving word anne frank get know sister margot parent otto edith mr pfeffer neighbor hermann petronella peter van daan survived year hunger hardship strained relationship hidden precariously small living quarter constant threat discovery subsequent arrest death vivid thoughtful tearing touching word promising young lady much say live whose life tragically cut short anne come bit childish even bratty sometimes considering circumstance feel bit emotionally edgy year forceful confinement looking lockdown remember miep gy fondly heart also go strongly margot get lucky anne circumstance considering account one visit one must make least lifetime powerful message resilience unbreakable human spirit despite world cruelty horror happening around extremely recommendable diary anne frank 1959 fantastic adaptation plot reasonably faithful book aesthetic acting pacing good little bit long length taste extra time worth millie perkins playing possibly memorable version anne shelley winter also gaining well deserved praise ending gosh effing ending better pair tissue ready highly recommendable anne frank whole story 2001 great adaptation adequate pacing decent acting memorable performance ben kingsley otto frank lili taylor miep gy two episode miniseries go beyond scope original book add powerful heart wrenching scene day anne margot concentration camp maybe accurate faithful book interesting nonetheless terribly heartbreaking diary anne frank 2009 know watched adaptation reason remember anything specific rated 7 10 imdb account assuming must good memorable though apparently guess watching three thousand movie sometimes memory gap start appear clearly one looking forward rewatch pick risk personal note 1947 283p non fiction historical extremely recommendable spite everything still believe people really good heart posiblemente el mejor diario personal jamás ocupación nazi de países bajos 1942 escondida en el secreto anexo superior de un edificio de oficinas con varias otras persona judías annelies marie frank tenía trece años cuando empezó escribir gatito su diario personal en él volcó todos sus pensamientos sobre la vida el amor su vida diaria con su familia otros refugiados el diario llegando un abrupto final en 1944 cuando todos fueron descubiertos enviados campos de concentración donde murió en 1945 por fiebre tifoidea la tierna edad de quince creo que esta sea una obra literaria maestra en sí misma pero puede ser muy justamente considerada como una de la más históricamente relevantes de su tiempo través de la simple amorosas palabras de anne frank llegamos conocer cómo ella su hermana margot sus padre otto edith sr pfeffer vecinos hermann petronella peter van daan sobrevivieron años de hambruna dificultades relaciones tensas escondidos en precariamente pequeños cuartos de vivienda con el constante peligro de ser descubiertos el subsiguiente arresto muerte vívido profundo desgarradoras conmovedoras palabras de una prometedora jovencita que tenía mucho por decir vivir cuya vida fue trágicamente terminada ante de tiempo anne puede parecer un poco infantil veces incluso malcriada pero considerando la circunstancias quién se sentiría emocionalmente tenso después de años de confinamiento forzado te estoy viendo vos cuarentena recuerdo miep gy muy afectuosamente mi corazón va fuertemente hacia margot que pudo ser tan afortunada como anne considerando la circunstancias toda cuentas uno de esas visitas que uno debe hacer al menos una vez en la vida un poderoso mensaje sobre la resiliencia del inquebrantable espíritu humano pesar de un mundo de crueldades horrores sucediendo alrededor extremadamente recomendable el diario de anne frank 1959 e una fantástica adaptación la trama más que razonablemente fiel al libro estética actuación ritmo muy buenos un poco demasiado extensa en su duración para mi gusto pero el tiempo extra más que lo vale millie perkins haciendo tal vez la más memorable versión de anne shelley winter también ganadora de muy merecida alabanza ese final dios ese maldito final mejor tener un par de pañuelos mano altamente recomendable anne frank toda la historia 2001 e una gran adaptación con adecuado ritmo decente elenco una muy memorable actuación de ben kingsley como otto frank lili taylor como miep gy esta miniserie de do episodios va más allá del alcance del libro original añade algunas poderosas conmovedoras escenas de los días de anne margot en el campo de concentración tal vez la más precisa fiel al libro pero sin embargo muy interesante terriblemente desgarradora el diario de anne frank 2009 sé que vi esta adaptación pero por alguna razón recuerdo nada específico de ella la califiqué 7 10 en mi cuenta de imdb así que asumo que debe ser buena aunque muy memorable aparentemente supongo que después de ver más de tres mil películas veces aparecen laguna de memoria esta claramente e una de esas estoy interesado en volver verla elegir riesgo propio nota personal 1947 283p ficción histórica extremadamente recomendable pesar de todo todavía creo

دوستان عزیز این پایان کار من است آمده اند که من را برای تیرباران شدن ببرند به جهنم مردن در منتهای پیروزی کمی تاسف آور است اما چه اهمیتی دارد اهمیت یک واقعه تنها در خیال آدمی ست پییر بنوآ 8 فوریه 1943 برداشت آزاد از نامه های تیرباران شده هانامه ای به آن فرانکدخترک عزیزمتا امروز هرگز پیش نیامده بود که گذر از یک صفحه ی کتاب به صفحه ی آخر برایم چنین عذاب آور و ناراحت کننده باشد کتاب های زیادی خوانده ام که نویسنده آن را نیمه کاره رها کرده اما هیچ پایان باز و به سرانجام نرسیده ای این اندازه برایم دردآور نبود کتاب را اگر فارغ از سرگذشتت بخوانم چیزی نیست جز دلنوشته های یک دختر تازه بالغ شرح ماجراهای بی اهمیت احساسات پرشور دوران نوجوانی و غرولند هایی درباره ی خوراک و وضعیت زندگی در دوران جنگ جهانی دوم اما حالا که می دانم چه بر سرت آمده مگر می توانم از آرزوهایت از آینده ای که برای خود متصور بودی از رویاها و امیدهایت به سادگی بدون اندوه و اشک بگذرم تو آرزو داشتی وقف چیزی شوی می خواستی مفید شوی و برای همه ی آن ها حتی کسانی که هرگز ندیدی لذت بیافرینی می خواستی بعد از مرگت هم به زندگی ادامه دهی اگر چه خاطراتت آن طور که می خواستی به پایان نرسید اگر چه داستان روزهای خاکستری ولی پر امیدت ناتمام ماند اما من داستان نانوشته ی تو را تا بلندای دودکش های آشویتس دنبال کردم تا گورهای دسته جمعی برگن تو به آرزویت رسیدی تو برای من و هزاران تن دیگر نمادی هستی از معصومیت امید و کودکی ای که به یغما رفته است اگرچه زندگی تو از دست رفت اما عشق تو به زندگی به درخت به آسمان در قلب ما نیرویی شد برای مبارزه با آن بخش از سرشت انسان که فرصت زیستن را از تو گرفت تا سرنوشت تو در کودکان دیگر تجسم نیابد تا تو و پتر آخرین فرزندان انسان باشید که به صلیب بی عدالتی و تبعیض کشیده می شوید آری ما قسم خوردیم و تا آن روز که انسان یار انسان باشد مقاومت خواهیم کردتهران 12 فوریه 2018 13th birthday anne frank received diary dubbed kitty shortly birthday fear older sister margo may taken nazi frank disappear night go hiding

1945 tender age fifteen n't think literary masterpiece itselft rightfully considered one historically relevant time simple loving word anne frank get know sister margot parent otto edith mr pfeffer neighbor hermann petronella peter van daan survived year hunger hardship strained relationship hidden precariously small living quarter constant threat discovery subsequent arrest death vivid thoughtful tearing touching word promising young lady much say live whose life tragically cut short anne come bit childish even bratty sometimes considering circumstance feel bit emotionally edgy year forceful confinement looking lockdown remember miep gy fondly heart also go strongly margot get lucky anne circumstance considering account one visit one must make least lifetime powerful message resilience unbreakable human spirit despite world cruelty horror happening around extremely recommendable diary anne frank 1959 fantastic adaptation plot reasonably faithful book aesthetic acting pacing good little bit long length taste extra time worth millie perkins playing possibly memorable version anne shelley winter also gaining well deserved praise ending gosh effing ending better pair tissue ready highly recommendable anne frank whole story 2001 great adaptation adequate pacing decent acting memorable performance ben kingsley otto frank lili taylor miep gy two episode miniseries go beyond scope original book add powerful heart wrenching scene day anne margot concentration camp maybe accurate faithful book interesting nonetheless terribly heartbreaking diary anne frank 2009 know watched adaptation reason remember anything specific rated 7 10 imdb account assuming must good memorable though apparently guess watching three thousand movie sometimes memory gap start appear clearly one looking forward rewatch pick risk personal note 1947 283p non fiction historical extremely recommendable spite everything still believe people really good heart posiblemente el mejor diario personal jamás ocupación nazi de países bajos 1942 escondida en el secreto anexo superior de un edificio de oficinas con varias otras persona judías annelies marie frank tenía trece años cuando empezó escribir gatito su diario personal en él volcó todos sus pensamientos sobre la vida el amor su vida diaria con su familia otros refugiados el diario llegando un abrupto final en 1944 cuando todos fueron descubiertos enviados campos de concentración donde murió en 1945 por fiebre tifoidea la tierna edad de quince creo que esta sea una obra literaria maestra en sí misma pero puede ser muy justamente considerada como una de la más históricamente relevantes de su tiempo través de la simple amorosas palabras de anne frank llegamos conocer cómo ella su hermana margot sus padre otto edith sr pfeffer vecinos hermann petronella peter van daan sobrevivieron años de hambruna dificultades relaciones tensas escondidos en precariamente pequeños cuartos de vivienda con el constante peligro de ser descubiertos el subsiguiente arresto muerte vívido profundo desgarradoras conmovedoras palabras de una prometedora jovencita que tenía mucho por decir vivir cuya vida fue trágicamente terminada ante de tiempo anne puede parecer un poco infantil veces incluso malcriada pero considerando la circunstancias quién se sentiría emocionalmente tenso después de años de confinamiento forzado te estoy viendo vos cuarentena recuerdo miep gy muy afectuosamente mi corazón va fuertemente hacia margot que pudo ser tan afortunada como anne considerando la circunstancias toda cuentas uno de esas visitas que uno debe hacer al menos una vez en la vida un poderoso mensaje sobre la resiliencia del inquebrantable espíritu humano pesar de un mundo de crueldades horrores sucediendo alrededor extremadamente recomendable el diario de anne frank 1959 e una fantástica adaptación la trama más que razonablemente fiel al libro estética actuación ritmo muy buenos un poco demasiado extensa en su duración para mi gusto pero el tiempo extra más que lo vale millie perkins haciendo tal vez la más memorable versión de anne shelley winter también ganadora de muy merecida alabanza ese final dios ese maldito final mejor tener un par de pañuelos mano altamente recomendable anne frank toda la historia 2001 e una gran adaptación con adecuado ritmo decente elenco una muy memorable actuación de ben kingsley como otto frank lili taylor como miep gy esta miniserie de episodios va más allá del alcance del libro original añade algunas poderosas conmovedoras escenas de los días de anne margot en el campo de concentración tal vez la más precisa fiel al libro pero sin embargo muy interesante terriblemente desgarradora el diario de anne frank 2009 sé que vi esta adaptación pero por alguna razón recuerdo nada específico de ella la califiqué 7 10 en mi cuenta de imdb así que asumo que debe ser buena aunque muy memorable aparentemente supongo que después de ver más de tres mil películas veces aparecen laguna de memoria esta claramente e una de esas estoy interesado en volver verla elegir riesgo propio nota personal 1947 283p ficción histórica extremadamente recomendable pesar de todo todavía creo

عزیز این پایان کار من است آمده اند که من را برای تیرباران شدن ببرند به جهنم مردن در منتهای پیروزی کمی تاسف آور است اما چه اهمیتی دارد اهمیت یک واقعه تنها در خیال آدمی ست پییر بنوآ 8 فوریه 1943 برداشت آزاد از نامه های تیرباران شده هانامه ای به آن فرانکدخترک عزیزمتا امروز هرگز پیش نیامده بود که گذر از یک صفحه ی کتاب به صفحه ی آخر برایم چنین عذاب آور و ناراحت کننده باشد کتاب های زیادی خوانده ام که نویسنده آن را نیمه کاره رها کرده اما هیچ پایان باز و به سرانجام نرسیده ای این اندازه برایم دردآور نبود کتاب را اگر فارغ از سرگذشتت بخوانم چیزی نیست جز دلنوشته های یک دختر تازه بالغ شرح ماجراهای بی اهمیت احساسات پرشور دوران نوجوانی و غرولند هایی درباره ی خوراک و وضعیت زندگی در دوران جنگ جهانی دوم اما حالا که می دانم چه بر سرت آمده مگر می توانم از آرزوهایت از آینده ای که برای خود متصور بودی از رویاها و امیدهایت به سادگی بدون اندوه و اشک بگذرم تو آرزو داشتی وقف چیزی شوی می خواستی مفید شوی و برای همه ی آن ها حتی کسانی که هرگز ندیدی لذت بیافرینی می خواستی بعد از مرگت هم به زندگی ادامه دهی اگر چه خاطراتت آن طور که می خواستی به پایان نرسید اگر چه داستان روزهای خاکستری ولی پر امیدت ناتمام ماند اما من داستان نانوشته ی تو را تا بلندای دودکش های آشویتس دنبال کردم تا گورهای دسته جمعی برگن تو به آرزویت رسیدی تو برای من و هزاران تن دیگر نمادی هستی از معصومیت امید و کودکی ای که به یغما رفته است اگرچه زندگی تو از دست رفت اما عشق تو به زندگی به درخت به آسمان در قلب ما نیرویی شد برای مبارزه با آن بخش از سرشت انسان که فرصت زیستن را از تو گرفت تا سرنوشت تو در کودکان دیگر تجسم نیابد تا تو و پتر آخرین فرزندان انسان باشید که به صلیب بی عدالتی و تبعیض کشیده می شوید آری ما قسم خوردیم و تا آن روز که انسان یار انسان باشد مقاومت خواهیم کردتهران 12 فوریه 2018 13th birthday anne frank received diary dubbed kitty shortly birthday fear older sister margo may taken nazi frank disappear night go hiding

ancestor mental physical superman also enjoyed much comfortable rewarding lifestyle subsequent peasant worker office clerk worked fewer hour since home also household chore allowed plenty free time

single source food hunter gatherer enjoyed superior multi nutrient diet le likely suffer hunger starvation subsequent agricultural society often depended single crop receiving much le nutrient also suffered heavily famine food source failed farming bah humbug true drawback harari reluctantly agrees although lucky soul made longer life expectancy averaged 30 40 year child dropped dead like fly

information dump time clear reader need certain level knowledge understand 's talking hawking make certain assumption shift concept concept left little confused thing n't appear related related made question intended readership really believe book every reader try important one full discussion idea could really open mind would warn prepared although seems like light reading much may go head approach caution thing learnt stephen hawking11 october 2014 ever since took physic year 11 love affair subject odd since went study art law degree probably something fact would staying power pour energy helping human knowledge advance towards establishing unified theory still wonder ended getting book sitting shelf quite probably busy listening people tell n't read book n't john lennox said unfinished book people start reading staying power get end ever written 'm sure book beat book though quite thing discovered reading book discovery wish share 1 anti god book one impression got certain people book atheist wrote try argue god exist much way richard dawkins book however statement could truth fact throughout book question existence god perpetually hang background granted hawking suggest concept infinite bounded universe n't ask turn true would undermine god 's existence however actually say may case fact final sentence book reason study physic try find unified theory race seek understand mind god 2 stephen hawking actually really good writer probably go without saying especially since cover book say 'record breaking best seller involved serious complicated research able write way many u probably studied physic year twelve level end high school understand okay probably advantage people since dad theoretical physicist regular conversation high level concept three dimension would cause orbit planet collapse still found easy follow explained many high level concept way many u could understand 3 scientist strange way viewing universe many u would familiar guy turn reading book come conclusion lot theoretical physicist seem live world okay probably n't spend time comic book store arguing whether babylon five better star trek actually one primary school friend theoretical physicist argument seem see world way ordinary people would consider strange instance see space flat meaning look star far concerned star direction however physicist see space curved straight line necessarily straight would see brick wall solid object idea walking one would result sore nose however physicist see made mostly space reason ca n't walk nuclear force force exist inside atom force level entire city prevent u concept dimension u three dimension however scientist hawking one see fact ten even dimension 4 many scientist atheist reading book could get past complex universe made wonder mathematical precision universe complexity lie therein many scientist seem argue came chance even hawking argues using second law thermodynamics universe move state disorder state order broken plate simply mend however argument also go big bang theory television show universe began state disorder moved state order however law physic seem suggest otherwise big bang sent motion series law caused universe come moment however go detail would require intense theoretical physic something desire delve moment 5 scientist assume speed light constant truth okay light travelling vacuum external force acting upon constant rarely case take instance phenomenon reason light behaves thus hit prism slows slows refracts thus point proven speed light constant external force acting upon external force may act upon light space well first black hole light hit black hole force gravity strong actually prevent light escaping thus gravity force effect light slows concept dark matter cloud matter emit light float star system okay know little stuff also theory proven hypothesis stuff exists would effect upon light namely slowing mean possibility calculation distance star sun could actually wrong 6 scientist know much think know one thing hawking stress book theory actually proven theory idea foundation based mathematical calculation empirical evidence therein lie problem much understanding universe based upon mathematical calculation appears event come cause mathematical calculation break immediately set try find another mathematical equation plug hole take light instance year believed light acted wave suddenly discovered also behaves like particle particle light called photon go matter year believed particle sudden discovered also behave like wave understanding universe suddenly break meaning necessarily made atom wavelike property well mathematical equation destructive modern world take global financial crisis instance bunch apparently really smart people create complex mathematical equation determine buy sell share make billion dollar however equation take account fact people could simply continue accumulate debt without pay back people began default loan enmass whole concept broke taken brink financial armageddon another point go back ancient greece theory democritus namely matter infinitely indivisible smallest piece matter atom theory aristotle matter infinitely divisible scientist preferred democritus theory however soon discovered could break atom proton neutron could even break quark maybe aristotle right 7 accept theory gadget work go without saying research discovery lead computer writing energy power device bomb level entire city know make nuclear bomb well smart phone n't question say obviously work however friend mine said still based theory something work necessarily mean theory correct remember penicillin discovered blind chance 8 nobel prize simply shiny bauble merit okay maybe people win prize actually really smart guy set long term capital management also nobel prize prof point 9 nobody really know gravity work gravity one odd force n't seem connect force universe hawking point four force identified electro magnetic strong nuclear weak nuclear gravity four force five divide electric magnetic since electricity create magnetic force effectively combined gravity stand probably hawking spends much time talking black hole black hole gravitational pull strong even light escape grasp thing gravity least knowledge opposing force gravity basically suck n't repulse force interesting text read maybe speculative science fiction simply remember top head people suggested gravity actually force another universe affect universe effectively sucking universe universe however said incredibly speculative since theoretical physicist ca n't really say subject 10 god gap cop idea god gap gap knowledge simply say 'oh god think nothing go back day paganism medieval europe unknown force weather attributed god god could know anything beyond fact however arguing cop creation scientist resort argument best lazy worst dangerous reason say discourages research area understand okay may never able control weather predict earthquake mean throw hand air say 'this hard may taking swipe creation scientist would also take swipe atheist claim god reason say seems fear within scientific community suggests may able know everything understanding universe may wrong problem arises throw idea god window claim universe came chance deny fact live incredibly ordered universe learn understand development mathematical formula formula turn wrong mean universe collapse wo n't mean go back drawing board start scratch 11 creation scientist dogmatic member scientific community insist must take bible literally bible scientific text never meant scientific text theological text tell u live one another view god science exists beyond bible neither contradicts okay granted god intervened world

rich deep though provoking would general reader know ca n't really evaluate judgment unless know something field ultimately recommend book know physic inside might find opinion interesting n't walk around parroting say black hole clue talking really need remedial course physic n't amazing person read book like brief history time stephen hawking come away feeling smarter dumber started universe live 's quite short generally quick read every page filled mind blowing numbing theory brain busting equation history say newton however page worth passage wee brain felt like getting sucked black hole mainly black hole segment 've forgotten much since left school since school long time ago taught back outdated nice read refresher cleanser came away better understanding big bang theory 's plausible tv show existence plausible 'm trying sort time space quantifiability thing 's going require reread probably study elsewhere surprisingly also came away idea god science coexist n't expect figured someone like hawking would like god pssh whatever 's take least impression book left brief history time written accessibility mind knowing full well idiot like would n't buy read recommend impossibly dense hawking 's sense humor even come occasion always appreciated sciencey texty thingies 'll probably move briefer history next 'd quite willing read others well well know think book stephen hawking explains history think know space time beginning end universe 're wrong book stephen hawking show people like poor comprehension skill even quantum mechanic importantly people understand granted still use finger count know surprised book talking copernicus newton einstein theory 've come describe universe work earth spin star burn never mentioned flat earth theory viable thing mean kinda sorta flipped 'thing past 5th century dude called pythagoras thought something wonky moon round earth n't round took hundred year aristotle put name behind idea apparently everyone went seriously 100 sure earth n't flat saw youtube video day made really good case hosted guy called qanon sounded totally legit also talked lot universe expanding relates maybe universe started seems though common sense would say everything moving away hit rewind vcr might able see contracting back together point contraction going get smaller smaller smaller smaller brought quantum mechanic thing lost ok fair lost started talking might center universe everything revolving around earth bottom line love story science math thing n't understand well fuck 'm trying count something right recommended really smart people people dumb hell n't mind reminded stephen hawking writes simple approachable way surface book written common man little knowledge theoretical physic hawking u basic terminology try overload writing explanation information dump time clear reader need certain level knowledge understand 's talking hawking make certain assumption shift concept concept left little confused thing n't appear related related made question intended readership really believe book every reader try important one full discussion idea could really open mind would warn prepared although seems like light reading much may go head approach caution thing learnt stephen hawking11 october 2014 ever since took physic year 11 love affair subject odd since went study art law degree probably something fact would staying power pour energy helping human knowledge advance towards establishing unified theory still wonder ended getting book sitting shelf quite probably busy listening people tell n't read book n't john lennox said unfinished book people start reading staying power get end ever written 'm sure book beat book though quite thing discovered reading book discovery wish share 1 anti god book one impression got certain people book atheist wrote try argue god exist much way richard dawkins book however statement could truth fact throughout book question existence god perpetually hang background granted hawking suggest concept infinite bounded universe n't ask turn true would undermine god 's existence however actually say may case fact final sentence book reason study physic try find unified theory race seek understand mind god 2 stephen hawking actually really good writer probably go without saying especially since cover book say 'record breaking best seller involved serious complicated research able write way many u probably studied physic year twelve level end high school understand okay probably advantage people since dad theoretical physicist regular conversation high level concept three dimension would cause orbit planet collapse still found easy follow explained many high level concept way many u could understand 3 scientist strange way viewing universe many u would familiar guy turn reading book come conclusion lot theoretical physicist seem live world okay probably n't spend time comic book store arguing whether babylon five better star trek actually one primary school friend theoretical physicist argument seem see world way ordinary people would consider strange instance see space flat meaning look star far concerned star direction however physicist see space curved straight line necessarily straight would see brick wall solid object idea walking one would result sore nose however physicist see made mostly space reason ca n't walk nuclear force force exist inside atom force level entire city prevent u concept dimension u three dimension however scientist hawking one see fact ten even dimension 4 many scientist atheist reading book could get past complex universe made wonder mathematical precision universe complexity lie therein many scientist seem argue came chance even hawking argues using second law thermodynamics universe move state disorder state order broken plate simply mend however argument also go big bang theory television show universe began state disorder moved state order however law physic seem suggest otherwise big bang sent motion series law caused universe come moment however go detail would require intense theoretical physic something desire delve moment 5 scientist assume speed light constant truth okay light travelling vacuum external force acting upon constant rarely case take instance phenomenon reason light behaves thus hit prism slows slows refracts thus point proven speed light constant external force acting upon external force may act upon light space well first black hole light hit black hole force gravity strong actually prevent light escaping thus gravity force effect light slows concept dark matter cloud matter emit light float star system okay know little stuff also theory proven hypothesis stuff exists would effect upon light namely slowing mean possibility calculation distance star sun could actually wrong 6 scientist know much think know one thing hawking stress book theory actually proven theory idea foundation based mathematical calculation empirical evidence therein lie problem much understanding universe based upon mathematical calculation appears event come cause mathematical calculation break immediately set try find another mathematical equation plug hole take light instance year believed light acted wave suddenly discovered also behaves like particle particle light called photon go matter year believed particle sudden discovered also behave like wave understanding universe suddenly break meaning necessarily made atom wavelike property well mathematical equation destructive modern world take global financial crisis instance bunch apparently really smart people create complex mathematical equation determine buy sell share make billion dollar however equation take account fact people could simply continue accumulate debt without pay back people began default loan enmass whole concept broke taken brink financial armageddon another point go back ancient greece theory democritus namely matter infinitely indivisible smallest piece matter atom theory aristotle matter infinitely divisible scientist preferred democritus theory however soon discovered could break atom proton neutron could even break quark maybe aristotle right 7 accept theory gadget work go without saying research discovery lead computer writing energy power device bomb level entire city know make nuclear bomb well smart phone n't question say obviously work however friend mine said still based theory something work necessarily mean theory correct remember penicillin discovered blind chance 8 nobel prize simply shiny bauble merit okay maybe people win prize actually really smart guy set long term capital management also nobel prize prof point 9 nobody really know gravity work gravity one odd force n't seem connect force universe hawking point four force identified electro magnetic strong nuclear weak nuclear gravity four force five divide electric magnetic since electricity create magnetic force effectively combined gravity stand probably hawking spends much time talking black hole black hole gravitational pull strong even light escape grasp thing gravity least knowledge opposing force gravity basically suck n't repulse force interesting text read maybe speculative science fiction simply remember top head people suggested gravity actually force another universe affect universe effectively sucking universe universe however said incredibly speculative since theoretical physicist ca n't really say subject 10 god gap cop idea god gap gap knowledge simply say 'oh god think nothing go back day paganism medieval europe unknown force weather attributed god god could know anything beyond fact however arguing cop creation scientist resort argument best lazy worst dangerous reason say discourages research area understand okay may never able control weather predict earthquake mean throw hand air say 'this hard may taking swipe creation scientist would also take swipe atheist claim god reason say seems fear within scientific community suggests may able know everything understanding universe may wrong problem arises throw idea god window claim universe came chance deny fact live incredibly ordered universe learn understand development mathematical formula formula turn wrong mean universe collapse wo n't mean go back drawing board start scratch 11 creation scientist dogmatic member scientific community insist must take bible literally bible scientific text never meant scientific text theological text tell u live one another view god science exists beyond bible neither contradicts okay granted god intervened world done thing break law science n't right created universe however bible tell u god god order god order make sense universe created ordered universe maybe looking whiz bang conclusion exposition book say
